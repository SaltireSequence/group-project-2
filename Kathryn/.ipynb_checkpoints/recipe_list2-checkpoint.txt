Add gnocchi and cook until they float, about 4-5 minutes. Remove gnocchi and reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water for the skillet.\n2 Cook the corn kernels: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the olive oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the corn kernels. Let kernels cook in the skillet for 4-5 minutes until they are brown and blistered. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stir them too much. Let them sit so they get some color.\n3 Add onions and garlic: Once the corn has blistered, add the sweet onions and garlic. Cook for a few minutes until the onions have softened and are translucent.\n4 Make the skillet sauce: Once the onions are soft, add the cooked gnocchi to the skillet and toss everything together. Turn the heat down to low and add 1/2 cup of the reserved gnocchi water, or 1/2 cup cream. Stir to combine ingredients, then let simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n5 Finish the dish: Right before serving, add the mozzarella balls to the skillet and garnish with fresh basil.\nLeftovers will keep well in the fridge for a few days. Reheat it in a skillet over low heat with a little water. If you freeze the dish, make sure to thaw and reheat it gently. A microwave will ruin the sauce and the gnocchi texture.\nHello!

One of my favorite brands is Bob\xe2\x80\x99s Red Mill.\nRecipe Tester Suggestion: Add an extra peach or two if you have them and want more juicy peaches in your crisp!\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crisp topping:\n1/2 cup (66 grams) oat flour (See recipe note)\n1/2 cup (78 grams) all-purpose flour\n1/3 cup old-fashioned rolled oats\n1/4 cup light brown sugar\n1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt\n3/4 cups pecans, roughly chopped\n1/2 cup unsalted butter cut into small pieces, well chilled\nFor the peaches:\n2 pounds peaches, sliced 1/2-inch thick (about 6 medium, or 6 cups sliced)\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/3 cup crystallized candied ginger, diced small\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon)\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, for the pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Make the crisp topping: In a small bowl, combine the two flours with a fork\xe2\x80\x94sometimes oat flour clumps together more than all-purpose. Add the rolled oats, brown sugar, and sea salt. Add the pecans and stir to combine.\nFinally, rub the butter until topping is buttery and crumbly. It should clump together easily between your fingers.\n3 Prepare the peaches: In a medium bowl, combine the sliced peaches, ground ginger, crystalized ginger, and sugar, along with the lemon juice. Stir together gently with a spatula.\n4 Prepare the pan: Put the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter into the cast iron pan and place into the oven for about 5 minutes, just until the butter melts.\n5 Assemble the crisp: Remove the pan from the oven and add the peach-ginger combination, spreading it out evenly. Add little dabs of the crisp topping as evenly as you can across the top of the peaches.\n  6 Bake the crisp: Bake in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the top is golden brown.\n7 Cool and serve: This is going to be hard, but you need to wait at least an hour before you scoop into this. Otherwise the juices will run everywhere, and you may burn your mouth.\nOnce it\xe2\x80\x99s made, this keeps best covered, in the refrigerator, for 3 to 4 days. Simply reheat it in a low oven for about 10 minutes.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

b'Print\nSlow Cooker Chickpea Curry with Sweet Potatoes and Red Peppers Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 8 hoursYield: 8 to 10 servings\nI prefer white-fleshed sweet potatoes for this recipe because they\'re starchier and hold up better to longer cooking. If you use orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, they will break down a little more and make a thicker, creamier sauce, which is also good!\nTo reduce cooking time, soak the chickpeas overnight, skip the extra water, and cook on high for 4 to 6 hours.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 medium yellow onion, diced\n1 pound dried chickpeas, rinsed\n2 tablespoons curry powder\n1 large white-fleshed sweet potato, peeled and diced (See Recipe Note)\n1 large or two small sweet bell peppers, diced (red or yellow, about 1/2 pound)\n1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes\n1 (15.5 ounce) can coconut milk\n1 1/4 cups water\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 diced serrano, jalape\xc3\xb1o, or fresno chili (optional)\n1 teaspoon salt\n6 cups spinach, roughly chopped, to serve\nCooked rice, to serve (optional)\nChopped cilantro, to serve\nLime or lemon wedges, to serve\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart or larger slow cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Combine the ingredients in the slow cooker: Drizzle olive oil in the bottom of a 6-quart or larger slow cooker then add onion and stir to coat. Pour dried chickpeas on top, then sprinkle the curry powder evenly over the beans.\nFollow with sweet potato, bell pepper, tomatoes, coconut milk, water, garlic, chili pepper (if using), and salt. Do not stir (leaving the chickpeas on the bottom and the sweet potatoes on top helps everything cook more evenly).\n2 Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours: If you\'re around, stir the curry after about 4 hours and give it a check. At this point, the curry should seem soupy and the chickpeas will likely be edible, but still crunchy. If the slow cooker seems dry, add another half cup of water. (The curry will also be fine if you\'re not around to stir it.)\nTotal cooking time will depend on your slow cooker and your chickpeas. The curry can be served any time after the chickpeas are soft and tender.\nIt\'s also fine to if the curry cooks a little longer, or if you leave it on the "warm" setting for a while. The recipe is very forgiving! The curry will get thicker and creamier the longer it cooks.\n3 Serve with spinach: Stir the curry well. Taste and add additional salt if needed. Serve the curry over bowls of chopped spinach, stirring to wilt the spinach. (You can also stir the spinach directly into the curry if that\'s more convenient for you.)\nGarnish with cilantro and a squeeze of lemon or lime.\nLeftovers will keep for about a week or can be frozen for up to three months.\nHello!

The Yukon golds will result in a creamier soup.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 large leeks (about 3 cups, chopped)\n2 tablespoons butter\n4 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth for vegetarian option)\n2 pounds potatoes (Yukon gold or Russet), peeled, diced into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 teaspoon sea salt, less or more to taste\nPinch of dried marjoram\n1 or 2 sprigs fresh thyme, or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme\n1 bay leaf\n1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\nSprinkle of Tabasco sauce or other red chili sauce\nWhite or black pepper to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Clean and cut the leeks: Cut off the roots of the leeks. Cut the leeks lengthwise, fan them open under running water to dislodge any dirt or mud hiding inside. Cut off the tough dark green tops and discard (either compost or freeze for making stock).\nSlice the white and light green parts of the leeks crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices. Place the slices in a bowl of cold water and agitate them with your hands to dislodge any remaining dirt. Then scoop out the leeks with a sieve or slotted spoon. (See How to Clean Leeks)\n2 Cook leeks in butter to soften: Melt butter on medium heat in a 3 to 4 quart thick-bottomed pot. Add the chopped leeks, stir to coat with the butter.\nCover the pot and reduce the heat to low, cook for 10 minutes until the leeks are softened. Check to make sure the leeks are not browning.\n3 Simmer the soup: Add the broth, diced potatoes, bay leaf, marjoram, thyme, and a teaspoon of salt to the pot.\nIncrease the heat to high to bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer, and cook for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked through.\n4 Pur\xc3\xa9e the soup: Remove and discard the bay leaf and thyme sprig. Use an immersion blender or standing blender to blend about half of the soup if you want a chunky soup, or all of it if you would like your soup to be more smooth.\nNote: if you're using a standing blender, pur\xc3\xa9e the soup in batches, don't fill the blender more than a third full at a time, and remember to hold down the lid while the blender is going.\n5 Season the soup: Add the parsley, and cook a few minutes more. Add a few dashes of Tabasco to taste.\nAdd freshly ground pepper and more salt to taste. (Potatoes soak up salt, so you may need to add more salt than you expect.)\nHello!

Freshly made rice will make a fried rice that's mushy.\nINGREDIENTS\n8 ounces small raw shrimp, shelled and deveined\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\nfreshly ground black pepper\n1/2 teaspoon cornstarch\n3 tablespoons peanut oil, canola oil, or rice bran oil\n3 eggs, beaten\n2 stalks green onion, minced\n4 cups leftover rice, grains separated well\n3/4 cup frozen peas and carrots, defrosted\n1 tablespoon soy sauce (use gluten-free soy sauce if you are making a gluten-free version), plus more to taste\n1 teaspoon dark toasted sesame oil\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toss shrimp with salt, pepper, cornstarch: In a medium bowl, sprinkle the shrimp with salt, pepper, and cornstarch, and toss to coat. Set aside to sit for ten minutes at room temperature.\n2 Heat pan on high heat: Heat a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan or wok (a seasoned cast iron pan or hard anodized aluminum works well, they're relatively stick free and can take the heat) on high heat.\nWhen the pan is very hot (a drop of water instantly sizzles when it hits the pan), swirl in one tablespoon of the cooking oil to coat the pan.\n3 Sear shrimp on both sides: Add the shrimp to the hot pan, spreading them out quickly in a single layer. Let them fry in the pan without moving them, for 30 seconds.\nFlip the shrimp over and let them fry on the other side for another 30 seconds or until they are mostly cooked through. (Do not cook them all the way!)\nUse a slotted spoon to scoop the shrimp out of the pan to a bowl.\n4 Cook beaten eggs, slightly runny: Return the pan to the burner and lower the heat to medium. Add a little more oil if the pan needs it. Add the beaten eggs and stir them quickly to scramble them while they cook.\nWhen the eggs are not quite cooked through, still a bit runny, transfer them from the pan to the bowl with the cooked shrimp.\n5 Saut\xc3\xa9 green onions, add rice: Clean out the pan or wok with paper towels and return it to the burner. Heat the pan on high and when it is hot, swirl in the remaining tablespoon or two of oil. When the oil is shimmering hot (almost smoking), add the green onions and saut\xc3\xa9 for 15 seconds.\nThen add the leftover cooked rice to the pan and stir with the green onions to mix well.\nSpread the rice onion mixture over the surface of the pan and let it fry, without moving it. You should hear the rice sizzle. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes.\nUse a spatula to turn over the rice, and spread it over the pan again. Let cook for a minute longer.\n6 Add soy sauce, carrots, peas, shrimp, eggs, sesame oil: Sprinkle soy sauce on the rice and stir to combine.\nAdd the carrots, peas, shrimp, eggs, and sesame oil, stirring to combine well.\nHeat everything until sizzling hot.

The cuts should be at an angle, in the direction of the grain of the meat as the knife tip is going in. The cuts should be about an inch apart from each other.\nTurn the steak over and repeat the cuts on the other side. Make sure that the cuts you are making on this side are parallel with the cuts you made on the other side, otherwise you may cut across an existing cut, and end up poking a hole through the meat.\n2 Rub with salt, pepper, dry mustard, and butter: Sprinkle one side of the steak with salt and freshly ground pepper. Sprinkle the steak with dry mustard. (You can use regular mustard if you don't have any dry mustard.)\nRub a tablespoon of butter all over the side of the steak. Turn the steak over and repeat with the dry mustard, pepper, and butter.\n3 Sear steak in hot frying pan: Heat a large cast iron frying pan on high heat. Place steak in hot pan. Let sear for 2 to 3 minutes until well browned.\nUse tongs to lift up to see if nicely browned. If so, flip to the other side and let sear for 2 to 3 minutes.\n4 Remove from heat: Remove the pan from the heat and let the steak continue to cook for 5 to 10 minutes in the residual heat of the pan (assuming you are using cast iron, if not, lower the heat to low).\n5 Check for doneness: Use your fingertips to check for doneness or insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak - 120\xc2\xb0F for very rare, 125\xc2\xb0F for rare, or 130\xc2\xb0F for medium rare. Flank steak should be served rare or medium rare, otherwise it may be too dry.\nIf the steak isn't done enough to your liking, return the steak and pan to medium high heat for a few minutes.\n6 Let the steak rest: Remove the steak from the pan to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes, covered with aluminum foil.\n7 Thinly slice: Cut the meat in very thin slices, at an angle, across the grain of the meat. (This way you break through the tough long muscle fibers.)\n8 Boil juices, deglaze pan, add butter to make sauce: Any juices that come out of the meat while cutting or resting, return to the pan. Return the pan to a burner on high heat and deglaze the pan with a little water, scraping up any browned bits. Once the water has mostly boiled down, add a little butter to the pan for a nice sauce.\nArrange the cut meat on a serving plate and pour the deglazed pan juices over the meat.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nNew England Boiled Dinner Recipe\nCook time: 4 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nCorned beef can be pretty salty, so if you are making boiled dinner with corned beef you may want to put it in a pot, cover with cold water, bring to a boil, and then discard the water before starting the recipe. If the broth ends up being too salty, you can serve just the meat and vegetables, without the broth, or add water to the broth to dilute it.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 1/2 pounds corned beef brisket or plain beef brisket\n15 peppercorns\n8 whole cloves\n1 bay leaf\nSalt, if using plain brisket\n2 medium sized turnips, peeled and quartered\n4 red new potatoes, peeled and quartered\n3 large carrots, cut into thirds and the thickest pieces quartered lengthwise\n1 small head cabbage, cut into fourths\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Put corned beef in a pot, cover with water, add seasonings, simmer: Put the brisket in a 5 or 6 quart Dutch oven and cover with an inch of water.\nIf you are using corned beef brisket and it does not come already packed in seasoning, add peppercorns, cloves, and a bay leaf to the pot.\nIf using plain brisket, add a teaspoon of salt for every quart of water.\nBring to a simmer and then cover, lower the heat until it is barely simmering. Keep at a low simmer for four hours or until the meat is tender (a fork goes through easily).\n2 Remove meat, add vegetables, simmer: Remove the meat and set aside, keeping the meat warm. Add the vegetables to the pot. Check the broth for taste. If it is too salty, add a little more water to taste.\nRaise the temperature and bring the soup to a high simmer. Cook at a high simmer until done, about 15-30 minutes longer, depending on the size of the cut of your vegetables.\n\n3 Slice meat across the grain: Slice the meat in thin slices across the grain. You may find it easier to slice if you first cut the roast in half along the same direction as the grain of the meat. Then slice smaller lengths across the grain.\n\nServe in bowls, a few pieces of meat in each, add some of the vegetables and some broth. Serve with horseradish or mustard or both.\nHello!

Slice first in half, and then slice off sections a half inch wide at widest point.\n2-3 bell peppers of various colors, stemmed, seeded, de-ribbed, sliced lengthwise into strips\nSalt\nSTEAK FAJITA MARINADE:\nJuice of 1 lime\n2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, peeled, minced\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/2 fresh jalape\xc3\xb1o pepper, seeded, ribs removed, finely chopped (be careful not to touch your eyes or anywhere near your eyes after handling a jalape\xc3\xb1o pepper!)\n1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, including stems\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Marinate the steak: Mix all marinade ingredients. Coat the steak with the marinade and let it sit at room temperature for an hour, or longer in the fridge.\nBefore you cook the meat, wipe off most of the marinade and sprinkle the steak with salt.\n2 Sear the steak on both sides: Set a large cast iron pan or griddle over high heat and let this heat up for 1-2 minutes. Add the tablespoon of oil to the pan and let this heat up for 1 minute.\nAdd the steak, frying on each side for 3 minutes, or to desired doneness. 3 minutes per side will yield approximately medium rare doneness for an average cut of flank steak.\nCarne asada and skirt steak will need less time. If the pan starts to smoke too much, reduce the heat to medium-high. You want the steak browned, not burned.\nRemove from pan and let sit, tented with foil, for 5 minutes.\n3 Cook the vegetables while the meat is resting. Add a little more oil to the pan if necessary, then add the onions and bell peppers.\nLet these sear for 1 minute before stirring, then stir every 90 seconds or so as the veggies sear. Cook for 5-6 minutes total.\n4 Slice the meat across the grain into thin slices. If you slice the meat at an angle, you will be able to get your slices pretty thin. These cuts of steak are flavorful but can be a little tough, so thin slices will really help make it easier to eat.\n5 Serve immediately with shredded cheese, salsa, shredded iceberg lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and warm flour tortillas. (Hint for warming tortillas - put in microwave over a paper towel for 20 seconds on high heat.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nBeef Brisket Pot Roast Recipe\nPrep time: 35 minutesCook time: 4 hours, 15 minutesYield: Serves 8-12\nINGREDIENTS\n4 to 5 pound (about 2 kg) beef brisket, flat cut or point cut\nSalt\n1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n3 large onions, sliced\n5 to 6 garlic cloves, minced\n1 sprig thyme\n1 sprig rosemary\n3 to 4 bay leaves\n2 cups beef stock\n2 to 3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces\n1 tablespoon mustard (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the brisket: On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.\nUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.\nSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n2 Sear the brisket: You\'ll need an ovenproof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\nPat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\nTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot. If not, add some olive oil.\nAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Saut\xc3\xa9, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1 to 2 more minutes.\n4 Simmer the brisket and roast it: Preheat the oven to 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C). Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.\nMove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop. Cover the pot, then place in the 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C) oven. Cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.\n5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\n6 Remove brisket: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.\n7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.\nTo make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into a blender, and pur\xc3\xa9e until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.\n8 Slice and serve: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the "grain" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices. (A sturdy bread knife works great for slicing roasts.)\nServe with the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles, or polenta.\nHello!

Stir to coat the chicken evenly. Let sit for 15 minutes at room temperature or up to overnight in the refrigerator.\n2 Make sweet sour sauce: Whisk together the pineapple juice, vinegar, ketchup, salt, and brown sugar.\n3 Stir-fry chicken: Heat a large frying pan or wok over high heat until a bead of water instantly sizzles and evaporates. Pour in the 1 tablespoon of cooking oil and swirl to coat. It\'s important that the pan is very hot.\nAdd the chicken and spread the chicken out in one layer. Let the chicken fry, untouched for 1 minute, until the bottoms are browned.\nFlip and fry the other side the same for 1 minute. The chicken should still be pinkish in the middle. Dish out the chicken onto a clean plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.\n4 Stir fry bell pepper and ginger: Turn the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 teaspoon of cooking oil. Let the oil heat up and then add the bell pepper chunks and ginger. Fry for 1 minute.\n5 Add pineapple, sweet sour sauce, let simmer, add chicken: Add the pineapple chunks and the sweet and sour sauce. Turn the heat to high and when the sauce is simmering, add the chicken pieces back in.\nLet simmer for 1-2 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Timing depends on how thick you\'ve cut your chicken. The best way to tell if the chicken is done is to take a piece out and cut into it. If it\'s pink, add another minute to the cooking.\nTaste the sauce and add more brown sugar if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nBroccoli Cheddar Soup Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nINGREDIENTS\n1 large head or two small heads broccoli (a little more than 1 pound), chopped into florets and stems\n1/4 cup unsalted butter\n1/2 white onion, chopped\n1 small carrot, peeled and grated\n1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n1 quart vegetable stock\n2 cups whole milk\n8 ounces cheddar cheese, grated\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/8 teaspoon fresh black pepper\nBread, for serving\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Blanch the broccoli: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a few big pinches of salt. Add broccoli stalks and blanch for 2 to 3 minutes until they are bright green and fork tender, but still slightly crispy.\nDrain broccoli. Scoop out and set aside about 1 cup of the florets for the topping.\n2 Cook the onions and carrots: Wipe out the pot, place over medium heat, and melt the butter. Once melted, add the onions and carrots, and cook until veggies soften, 4 to 5 minutes, stirring regularly.\n3 Cook the soup: Stir in the all-purpose flour. The flour will form a paste with the veggies. Cook for a minute or two to coat the vegetables, and then start to slowly pour in vegetable stock. Stir constantly as you pour in the stock to avoid lumps.\nOnce all the stock is added, bring soup up to a low simmer. Add milk and the blanched broccoli (except what you're saving for the topping). Simmer for about 10 minutes over low heat.\n4 Puree the soup: Blend with an immersion blender, or let the soup cool until no longer steaming and blend in batches in a blender. (If using a blender, be careful to let the soup cool a bit and do not overfill the blender to avoid splattered hot soup!)\n5 Season to taste and serve: Add the grated cheese, salt, and pepper to the pureed soup and stir over low heat until the cheese has melted. Taste soup and season with additional salt and pepper to your liking.\nLadle the soup into bowls and garnish with some reserved broccoli and extra cheese on top. Serve with bread.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nBaked Acorn Squash with Butter and Brown Sugar Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 15 minutesYield: Serves 2 to 4, depending on how much squash you like to eat.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 Acorn squash\n1 Tbsp Butter\n2 Tbsp Brown Sugar\n2 teaspoons Maple Syrup\nDash of Salt\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat your oven to 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C).\n2 Prep the squash: If you have a microwave, microwave the squash for a minute each, to make it easier to cut. Stabilize the squash on a cutting board as best you can, stem end down if the stem is short enough, otherwise on the side. Using a sharp, sturdy chef's knife, carefully cut the acorn squash in half, from tip to stem. If on its side, the squash can rock back and forth, so take care as you are cutting it.\nUse a sturdy metal spoon to scrape out the seeds and stringy bits inside each squash half, until the inside is smooth.\nTake a sharp paring knife and score the insides of the acorn squash halves in a cross-hatch pattern, about a half-inch deep cuts.\nPlace the squash halves cut side up in a roasting pan. Pour 1/4-inch of water over the bottom of the pan so that the squash doesn't burn or get dried out in the oven.\n3 Add butter, salt, brown sugar, maple syrup: Rub a half tablespoon of butter into the insides of each half. Sprinkle with a little salt if you are using unsalted butter.\nCrumble a tablespoon of brown sugar into the center of each half and drizzle with a teaspoon of maple syrup.\n4 Bake: Bake at 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C) for about an hour to an hour 15 minutes, until the tops of the squash halves are nicely browned, and the squash flesh is very soft and cooked through.\nIt's hard to overcook squash, it just gets better with more caramelization. But don't undercook it.\n5 Remove from oven, spoon brown sugar butter sauce over squash: When done, remove the squash halves from the oven and let them cool for a bit before serving.\nSpoon any buttery sugar sauce that has not already been absorbed by the squash over the exposed areas.\nHello!
