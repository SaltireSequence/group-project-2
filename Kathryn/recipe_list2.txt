Add gnocchi and cook until they float, about 4-5 minutes. Remove gnocchi and reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water for the skillet.\n2 Cook the corn kernels: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the olive oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the corn kernels. Let kernels cook in the skillet for 4-5 minutes until they are brown and blistered. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stir them too much. Let them sit so they get some color.\n3 Add onions and garlic: Once the corn has blistered, add the sweet onions and garlic. Cook for a few minutes until the onions have softened and are translucent.\n4 Make the skillet sauce: Once the onions are soft, add the cooked gnocchi to the skillet and toss everything together. Turn the heat down to low and add 1/2 cup of the reserved gnocchi water, or 1/2 cup cream. Stir to combine ingredients, then let simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n5 Finish the dish: Right before serving, add the mozzarella balls to the skillet and garnish with fresh basil.\nLeftovers will keep well in the fridge for a few days. Reheat it in a skillet over low heat with a little water. If you freeze the dish, make sure to thaw and reheat it gently. A microwave will ruin the sauce and the gnocchi texture.\nHello!

One of my favorite brands is Bob\xe2\x80\x99s Red Mill.\nRecipe Tester Suggestion: Add an extra peach or two if you have them and want more juicy peaches in your crisp!\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crisp topping:\n1/2 cup (66 grams) oat flour (See recipe note)\n1/2 cup (78 grams) all-purpose flour\n1/3 cup old-fashioned rolled oats\n1/4 cup light brown sugar\n1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt\n3/4 cups pecans, roughly chopped\n1/2 cup unsalted butter cut into small pieces, well chilled\nFor the peaches:\n2 pounds peaches, sliced 1/2-inch thick (about 6 medium, or 6 cups sliced)\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/3 cup crystallized candied ginger, diced small\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon)\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, for the pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Make the crisp topping: In a small bowl, combine the two flours with a fork\xe2\x80\x94sometimes oat flour clumps together more than all-purpose. Add the rolled oats, brown sugar, and sea salt. Add the pecans and stir to combine.\nFinally, rub the butter until topping is buttery and crumbly. It should clump together easily between your fingers.\n3 Prepare the peaches: In a medium bowl, combine the sliced peaches, ground ginger, crystalized ginger, and sugar, along with the lemon juice. Stir together gently with a spatula.\n4 Prepare the pan: Put the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter into the cast iron pan and place into the oven for about 5 minutes, just until the butter melts.\n5 Assemble the crisp: Remove the pan from the oven and add the peach-ginger combination, spreading it out evenly. Add little dabs of the crisp topping as evenly as you can across the top of the peaches.\n  6 Bake the crisp: Bake in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the top is golden brown.\n7 Cool and serve: This is going to be hard, but you need to wait at least an hour before you scoop into this. Otherwise the juices will run everywhere, and you may burn your mouth.\nOnce it\xe2\x80\x99s made, this keeps best covered, in the refrigerator, for 3 to 4 days. Simply reheat it in a low oven for about 10 minutes.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

b'Print\nSlow Cooker Chickpea Curry with Sweet Potatoes and Red Peppers Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 8 hoursYield: 8 to 10 servings\nI prefer white-fleshed sweet potatoes for this recipe because they\'re starchier and hold up better to longer cooking. If you use orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, they will break down a little more and make a thicker, creamier sauce, which is also good!\nTo reduce cooking time, soak the chickpeas overnight, skip the extra water, and cook on high for 4 to 6 hours.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 medium yellow onion, diced\n1 pound dried chickpeas, rinsed\n2 tablespoons curry powder\n1 large white-fleshed sweet potato, peeled and diced (See Recipe Note)\n1 large or two small sweet bell peppers, diced (red or yellow, about 1/2 pound)\n1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes\n1 (15.5 ounce) can coconut milk\n1 1/4 cups water\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 diced serrano, jalape\xc3\xb1o, or fresno chili (optional)\n1 teaspoon salt\n6 cups spinach, roughly chopped, to serve\nCooked rice, to serve (optional)\nChopped cilantro, to serve\nLime or lemon wedges, to serve\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart or larger slow cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Combine the ingredients in the slow cooker: Drizzle olive oil in the bottom of a 6-quart or larger slow cooker then add onion and stir to coat. Pour dried chickpeas on top, then sprinkle the curry powder evenly over the beans.\nFollow with sweet potato, bell pepper, tomatoes, coconut milk, water, garlic, chili pepper (if using), and salt. Do not stir (leaving the chickpeas on the bottom and the sweet potatoes on top helps everything cook more evenly).\n2 Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours: If you\'re around, stir the curry after about 4 hours and give it a check. At this point, the curry should seem soupy and the chickpeas will likely be edible, but still crunchy. If the slow cooker seems dry, add another half cup of water. (The curry will also be fine if you\'re not around to stir it.)\nTotal cooking time will depend on your slow cooker and your chickpeas. The curry can be served any time after the chickpeas are soft and tender.\nIt\'s also fine to if the curry cooks a little longer, or if you leave it on the "warm" setting for a while. The recipe is very forgiving! The curry will get thicker and creamier the longer it cooks.\n3 Serve with spinach: Stir the curry well. Taste and add additional salt if needed. Serve the curry over bowls of chopped spinach, stirring to wilt the spinach. (You can also stir the spinach directly into the curry if that\'s more convenient for you.)\nGarnish with cilantro and a squeeze of lemon or lime.\nLeftovers will keep for about a week or can be frozen for up to three months.\nHello!

The Yukon golds will result in a creamier soup.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 large leeks (about 3 cups, chopped)\n2 tablespoons butter\n4 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth for vegetarian option)\n2 pounds potatoes (Yukon gold or Russet), peeled, diced into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 teaspoon sea salt, less or more to taste\nPinch of dried marjoram\n1 or 2 sprigs fresh thyme, or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme\n1 bay leaf\n1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\nSprinkle of Tabasco sauce or other red chili sauce\nWhite or black pepper to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Clean and cut the leeks: Cut off the roots of the leeks. Cut the leeks lengthwise, fan them open under running water to dislodge any dirt or mud hiding inside. Cut off the tough dark green tops and discard (either compost or freeze for making stock).\nSlice the white and light green parts of the leeks crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices. Place the slices in a bowl of cold water and agitate them with your hands to dislodge any remaining dirt. Then scoop out the leeks with a sieve or slotted spoon. (See How to Clean Leeks)\n2 Cook leeks in butter to soften: Melt butter on medium heat in a 3 to 4 quart thick-bottomed pot. Add the chopped leeks, stir to coat with the butter.\nCover the pot and reduce the heat to low, cook for 10 minutes until the leeks are softened. Check to make sure the leeks are not browning.\n3 Simmer the soup: Add the broth, diced potatoes, bay leaf, marjoram, thyme, and a teaspoon of salt to the pot.\nIncrease the heat to high to bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer, and cook for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked through.\n4 Pur\xc3\xa9e the soup: Remove and discard the bay leaf and thyme sprig. Use an immersion blender or standing blender to blend about half of the soup if you want a chunky soup, or all of it if you would like your soup to be more smooth.\nNote: if you're using a standing blender, pur\xc3\xa9e the soup in batches, don't fill the blender more than a third full at a time, and remember to hold down the lid while the blender is going.\n5 Season the soup: Add the parsley, and cook a few minutes more. Add a few dashes of Tabasco to taste.\nAdd freshly ground pepper and more salt to taste. (Potatoes soak up salt, so you may need to add more salt than you expect.)\nHello!

Freshly made rice will make a fried rice that's mushy.\nINGREDIENTS\n8 ounces small raw shrimp, shelled and deveined\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\nfreshly ground black pepper\n1/2 teaspoon cornstarch\n3 tablespoons peanut oil, canola oil, or rice bran oil\n3 eggs, beaten\n2 stalks green onion, minced\n4 cups leftover rice, grains separated well\n3/4 cup frozen peas and carrots, defrosted\n1 tablespoon soy sauce (use gluten-free soy sauce if you are making a gluten-free version), plus more to taste\n1 teaspoon dark toasted sesame oil\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toss shrimp with salt, pepper, cornstarch: In a medium bowl, sprinkle the shrimp with salt, pepper, and cornstarch, and toss to coat. Set aside to sit for ten minutes at room temperature.\n2 Heat pan on high heat: Heat a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan or wok (a seasoned cast iron pan or hard anodized aluminum works well, they're relatively stick free and can take the heat) on high heat.\nWhen the pan is very hot (a drop of water instantly sizzles when it hits the pan), swirl in one tablespoon of the cooking oil to coat the pan.\n3 Sear shrimp on both sides: Add the shrimp to the hot pan, spreading them out quickly in a single layer. Let them fry in the pan without moving them, for 30 seconds.\nFlip the shrimp over and let them fry on the other side for another 30 seconds or until they are mostly cooked through. (Do not cook them all the way!)\nUse a slotted spoon to scoop the shrimp out of the pan to a bowl.\n4 Cook beaten eggs, slightly runny: Return the pan to the burner and lower the heat to medium. Add a little more oil if the pan needs it. Add the beaten eggs and stir them quickly to scramble them while they cook.\nWhen the eggs are not quite cooked through, still a bit runny, transfer them from the pan to the bowl with the cooked shrimp.\n5 Saut\xc3\xa9 green onions, add rice: Clean out the pan or wok with paper towels and return it to the burner. Heat the pan on high and when it is hot, swirl in the remaining tablespoon or two of oil. When the oil is shimmering hot (almost smoking), add the green onions and saut\xc3\xa9 for 15 seconds.\nThen add the leftover cooked rice to the pan and stir with the green onions to mix well.\nSpread the rice onion mixture over the surface of the pan and let it fry, without moving it. You should hear the rice sizzle. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes.\nUse a spatula to turn over the rice, and spread it over the pan again. Let cook for a minute longer.\n6 Add soy sauce, carrots, peas, shrimp, eggs, sesame oil: Sprinkle soy sauce on the rice and stir to combine.\nAdd the carrots, peas, shrimp, eggs, and sesame oil, stirring to combine well.\nHeat everything until sizzling hot.

The cuts should be at an angle, in the direction of the grain of the meat as the knife tip is going in. The cuts should be about an inch apart from each other.\nTurn the steak over and repeat the cuts on the other side. Make sure that the cuts you are making on this side are parallel with the cuts you made on the other side, otherwise you may cut across an existing cut, and end up poking a hole through the meat.\n2 Rub with salt, pepper, dry mustard, and butter: Sprinkle one side of the steak with salt and freshly ground pepper. Sprinkle the steak with dry mustard. (You can use regular mustard if you don't have any dry mustard.)\nRub a tablespoon of butter all over the side of the steak. Turn the steak over and repeat with the dry mustard, pepper, and butter.\n3 Sear steak in hot frying pan: Heat a large cast iron frying pan on high heat. Place steak in hot pan. Let sear for 2 to 3 minutes until well browned.\nUse tongs to lift up to see if nicely browned. If so, flip to the other side and let sear for 2 to 3 minutes.\n4 Remove from heat: Remove the pan from the heat and let the steak continue to cook for 5 to 10 minutes in the residual heat of the pan (assuming you are using cast iron, if not, lower the heat to low).\n5 Check for doneness: Use your fingertips to check for doneness or insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak - 120\xc2\xb0F for very rare, 125\xc2\xb0F for rare, or 130\xc2\xb0F for medium rare. Flank steak should be served rare or medium rare, otherwise it may be too dry.\nIf the steak isn't done enough to your liking, return the steak and pan to medium high heat for a few minutes.\n6 Let the steak rest: Remove the steak from the pan to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes, covered with aluminum foil.\n7 Thinly slice: Cut the meat in very thin slices, at an angle, across the grain of the meat. (This way you break through the tough long muscle fibers.)\n8 Boil juices, deglaze pan, add butter to make sauce: Any juices that come out of the meat while cutting or resting, return to the pan. Return the pan to a burner on high heat and deglaze the pan with a little water, scraping up any browned bits. Once the water has mostly boiled down, add a little butter to the pan for a nice sauce.\nArrange the cut meat on a serving plate and pour the deglazed pan juices over the meat.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nNew England Boiled Dinner Recipe\nCook time: 4 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nCorned beef can be pretty salty, so if you are making boiled dinner with corned beef you may want to put it in a pot, cover with cold water, bring to a boil, and then discard the water before starting the recipe. If the broth ends up being too salty, you can serve just the meat and vegetables, without the broth, or add water to the broth to dilute it.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 1/2 pounds corned beef brisket or plain beef brisket\n15 peppercorns\n8 whole cloves\n1 bay leaf\nSalt, if using plain brisket\n2 medium sized turnips, peeled and quartered\n4 red new potatoes, peeled and quartered\n3 large carrots, cut into thirds and the thickest pieces quartered lengthwise\n1 small head cabbage, cut into fourths\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Put corned beef in a pot, cover with water, add seasonings, simmer: Put the brisket in a 5 or 6 quart Dutch oven and cover with an inch of water.\nIf you are using corned beef brisket and it does not come already packed in seasoning, add peppercorns, cloves, and a bay leaf to the pot.\nIf using plain brisket, add a teaspoon of salt for every quart of water.\nBring to a simmer and then cover, lower the heat until it is barely simmering. Keep at a low simmer for four hours or until the meat is tender (a fork goes through easily).\n2 Remove meat, add vegetables, simmer: Remove the meat and set aside, keeping the meat warm. Add the vegetables to the pot. Check the broth for taste. If it is too salty, add a little more water to taste.\nRaise the temperature and bring the soup to a high simmer. Cook at a high simmer until done, about 15-30 minutes longer, depending on the size of the cut of your vegetables.\n\n3 Slice meat across the grain: Slice the meat in thin slices across the grain. You may find it easier to slice if you first cut the roast in half along the same direction as the grain of the meat. Then slice smaller lengths across the grain.\n\nServe in bowls, a few pieces of meat in each, add some of the vegetables and some broth. Serve with horseradish or mustard or both.\nHello!

Slice first in half, and then slice off sections a half inch wide at widest point.\n2-3 bell peppers of various colors, stemmed, seeded, de-ribbed, sliced lengthwise into strips\nSalt\nSTEAK FAJITA MARINADE:\nJuice of 1 lime\n2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, peeled, minced\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/2 fresh jalape\xc3\xb1o pepper, seeded, ribs removed, finely chopped (be careful not to touch your eyes or anywhere near your eyes after handling a jalape\xc3\xb1o pepper!)\n1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, including stems\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Marinate the steak: Mix all marinade ingredients. Coat the steak with the marinade and let it sit at room temperature for an hour, or longer in the fridge.\nBefore you cook the meat, wipe off most of the marinade and sprinkle the steak with salt.\n2 Sear the steak on both sides: Set a large cast iron pan or griddle over high heat and let this heat up for 1-2 minutes. Add the tablespoon of oil to the pan and let this heat up for 1 minute.\nAdd the steak, frying on each side for 3 minutes, or to desired doneness. 3 minutes per side will yield approximately medium rare doneness for an average cut of flank steak.\nCarne asada and skirt steak will need less time. If the pan starts to smoke too much, reduce the heat to medium-high. You want the steak browned, not burned.\nRemove from pan and let sit, tented with foil, for 5 minutes.\n3 Cook the vegetables while the meat is resting. Add a little more oil to the pan if necessary, then add the onions and bell peppers.\nLet these sear for 1 minute before stirring, then stir every 90 seconds or so as the veggies sear. Cook for 5-6 minutes total.\n4 Slice the meat across the grain into thin slices. If you slice the meat at an angle, you will be able to get your slices pretty thin. These cuts of steak are flavorful but can be a little tough, so thin slices will really help make it easier to eat.\n5 Serve immediately with shredded cheese, salsa, shredded iceberg lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and warm flour tortillas. (Hint for warming tortillas - put in microwave over a paper towel for 20 seconds on high heat.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nBeef Brisket Pot Roast Recipe\nPrep time: 35 minutesCook time: 4 hours, 15 minutesYield: Serves 8-12\nINGREDIENTS\n4 to 5 pound (about 2 kg) beef brisket, flat cut or point cut\nSalt\n1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n3 large onions, sliced\n5 to 6 garlic cloves, minced\n1 sprig thyme\n1 sprig rosemary\n3 to 4 bay leaves\n2 cups beef stock\n2 to 3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces\n1 tablespoon mustard (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the brisket: On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.\nUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.\nSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n2 Sear the brisket: You\'ll need an ovenproof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\nPat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\nTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot. If not, add some olive oil.\nAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Saut\xc3\xa9, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1 to 2 more minutes.\n4 Simmer the brisket and roast it: Preheat the oven to 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C). Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.\nMove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop. Cover the pot, then place in the 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C) oven. Cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.\n5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\n6 Remove brisket: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.\n7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.\nTo make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into a blender, and pur\xc3\xa9e until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.\n8 Slice and serve: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the "grain" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices. (A sturdy bread knife works great for slicing roasts.)\nServe with the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles, or polenta.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nSweet and Sour Chicken Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound of boneless and skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1" chunks\n1 egg white\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (1/4 teaspoon table salt)\n2 teaspoons cornstarch\n1 10-ounce can pineapple chunks (reserve juice)\n1/4 cup juice from the canned pineapple\n1/4 cup white vinegar\n1/4 cup ketchup\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (1/4 teaspoon table salt)\n2-3 tablespoons brown sugar\n1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon cooking oil\n1 red bell pepper, cut into 1 inch chunks\n1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1 inch chunks\n1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger\nMETHOD\n1 Coat chicken with egg white, salt, and cornstarch: In a bowl, combine the chicken with the egg white, salt and cornstarch. Stir to coat the chicken evenly. Let sit for 15 minutes at room temperature or up to overnight in the refrigerator.\n2 Make sweet sour sauce: Whisk together the pineapple juice, vinegar, ketchup, salt, and brown sugar.\n3 Stir-fry chicken: Heat a large frying pan or wok over high heat until a bead of water instantly sizzles and evaporates. Pour in the 1 tablespoon of cooking oil and swirl to coat. It\'s important that the pan is very hot.\nAdd the chicken and spread the chicken out in one layer. Let the chicken fry, untouched for 1 minute, until the bottoms are browned.\nFlip and fry the other side the same for 1 minute. The chicken should still be pinkish in the middle. Dish out the chicken onto a clean plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.\n4 Stir fry bell pepper and ginger: Turn the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 teaspoon of cooking oil. Let the oil heat up and then add the bell pepper chunks and ginger. Fry for 1 minute.\n5 Add pineapple, sweet sour sauce, let simmer, add chicken: Add the pineapple chunks and the sweet and sour sauce. Turn the heat to high and when the sauce is simmering, add the chicken pieces back in.\nLet simmer for 1-2 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Timing depends on how thick you\'ve cut your chicken. The best way to tell if the chicken is done is to take a piece out and cut into it. If it\'s pink, add another minute to the cooking.\nTaste the sauce and add more brown sugar if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nBroccoli Cheddar Soup Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nINGREDIENTS\n1 large head or two small heads broccoli (a little more than 1 pound), chopped into florets and stems\n1/4 cup unsalted butter\n1/2 white onion, chopped\n1 small carrot, peeled and grated\n1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n1 quart vegetable stock\n2 cups whole milk\n8 ounces cheddar cheese, grated\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/8 teaspoon fresh black pepper\nBread, for serving\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Blanch the broccoli: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a few big pinches of salt. Add broccoli stalks and blanch for 2 to 3 minutes until they are bright green and fork tender, but still slightly crispy.\nDrain broccoli. Scoop out and set aside about 1 cup of the florets for the topping.\n2 Cook the onions and carrots: Wipe out the pot, place over medium heat, and melt the butter. Once melted, add the onions and carrots, and cook until veggies soften, 4 to 5 minutes, stirring regularly.\n3 Cook the soup: Stir in the all-purpose flour. The flour will form a paste with the veggies. Cook for a minute or two to coat the vegetables, and then start to slowly pour in vegetable stock. Stir constantly as you pour in the stock to avoid lumps.\nOnce all the stock is added, bring soup up to a low simmer. Add milk and the blanched broccoli (except what you're saving for the topping). Simmer for about 10 minutes over low heat.\n4 Puree the soup: Blend with an immersion blender, or let the soup cool until no longer steaming and blend in batches in a blender. (If using a blender, be careful to let the soup cool a bit and do not overfill the blender to avoid splattered hot soup!)\n5 Season to taste and serve: Add the grated cheese, salt, and pepper to the pureed soup and stir over low heat until the cheese has melted. Taste soup and season with additional salt and pepper to your liking.\nLadle the soup into bowls and garnish with some reserved broccoli and extra cheese on top. Serve with bread.\nHello!

b'Print\nVegan Stuffed Squash with Brown Rice and Mushrooms Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 6\nThe vegetables and rice for the filling and the roasted squash halves can be prepped a day or two ahead. Warm them on the stovetop or in the microwave before continuing with the recipe.\nNote that one of the squashes is pureed and mixed into the filling. The remaining squash halves will be stuffed and served.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the squash:\n4 small winter squash (about 1 1/2 pounds each), like kabocha, acorn squash, or pie pumpkins\n1/2 tablespoon olive oil\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon pepper\nFor the filling:\n4 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n2 cups brown rice\n4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth or water\n1 cup diced carrot\n1 cup diced shallots\n1 cup diced celery\n1 1/4 pounds mushrooms, diced (I used a mix of creminis and wild mushrooms),\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1/2 cup white wine\nPinch cinnamon\n1 cup chopped mixed herbs (parsley, chives, and chervil work beautifully here)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the oven to 400F and prepare the squash. Cut the squash in half and scrape out the seeds. Cut a small sliver from the bottom of each squash half to create a stable surface for the "bowl." Rub the squash halves inside and out with olive oil, then sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.\n2 Roast the squash: Roast the squash halves cut-side down for 30 minutes, then flip them over and roast cut-side up (like a bowl) for another 15 minutes. When done, the squash should be easily pierced with a fork and toasted golden-brown on the surface. (About 45 minutes total; if the squash finishes roasting before the filling is ready, turn the oven heat to its lowest temperature and keep them warm until needed.)\n3 While the squash roasts, begin preparing the rice stuffing: In a large pot over medium heat, toast the rice with 1 tablespoon of olive oil until the rice smells fragrant and nutty, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir frequently to avoid burning.\n4 Cook the rice: Pour the vegetable broth or water over the rice and give it a quick stir. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once the water reaches boiling, turn down heat to low, cover the pot, and cook for 25 to 30 minutes until the rice is tender. If the rice isn\xe2\x80\x99t done, continue checking every five minutes.\n5 Cook the carrots, shallots, and celery: Warm 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Saut\xc3\xa9 the carrot, shallot, and celery until the shallots become translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer the veggies to a large bowl, and set aside.\n6 Cook the mushrooms in batches: In the same 12-inch skillet, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and turn the heat to medium-high. Add a third of the mushrooms \xe2\x80\x93 do not to overcrowd the pan. Sprinkle 1/8 teaspoon salt and a little pepper over the mushrooms, but do not stir.\nLet the mushrooms cook without stirring for 2 to 3 minutes, until a caramelized crust forms on the bottom of the mushrooms. (Lift one up to check!) Once you see a brown crust, stir the mushrooms together. Continue cooking, stirring often, until the mushrooms have released all their liquid and look evenly browned on all sides.\nRepeat with the remaining mushrooms, adding more oil to the pan as needed.\n7 Finish the vegetables: When all the mushrooms are cooked, return the cooked mushrooms, carrots, shallots, and celery to the pan over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add the white wine and scrape any glazed bits from the bottom of the pan as the wine simmers. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, until most of the wine has evaporated. Remove from heat.\n(If the vegetables and rice are ready before the roasted squash, cover the pans to keep warm until needed. If necessary, re-warm briefly on the stovetop or the microwave before continuing with the recipe.)\n8 Set 6 of the roasted squash halves on plates for serving; scoop the flesh from the remaining 2 squash halves. Transfer the flesh to a food processor. Add the cinnamon and puree until very smooth.\n9 Finish the squash filling: In a large bowl, combine the mushrooms, vegetables, cooked rice, and squash puree and mix until well-combined. Taste and add more salt, pepper, or cinnamon if you like. Finally, stir in fresh herbs, reserving some herbs for sprinkling over top.\n10 Stuff the squashes and serve: Divide the filling equally between all the squash halves, mounding the filling slightly. Sprinkle with chopped herbs and serve immediately while piping hot.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nRoasted Winter Squash with Cilantro Chimichurri Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 6 to 8 servings\nI typically use acorn or delicata squash for this recipe since they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be peeled and are easily prepped, though feel free to use any other hearty winter squash like butternut, pumpkin, or kuri. The chimichurri sauce is also great on roasted potatoes, carrots, and sweet potatoes.\nUrfa biber is a dark maroon chili flake common in Turkish cuisine. A super adulty spice. The chilies are sun-cured during the day and sweated at night before being ground with a touch of salt. The result is a smoky-salty-sweet-savory chili flake whose complex flavor is reminiscent of chocolate, raisins, and inky red wine. The heat is mild, but builds the more you eat, yet never overwhelms. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of those rare ingredients that really can go on nearly everything. I actually keep it in a small container on the kitchen table for this reason and recommend you do so as well.\nYou can find urfa biber pretty easily online at stores like Spice Jungle or Olive Nation. However, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have urfa biber chili flakes, then feel free to use regular chili flakes. I have done this plenty of times and the recipe is equally awesome.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the squash:\n3 pounds acorn or delicata squash\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1/4 teaspoon salt\nGround black pepper\nFor the cilantro chimichurri:\n1/2 cup olive oil\n1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro\n1/2 cup finely chopped parsley\n1 tablespoon finely chopped oregano leaves\n1 1/2 teaspoons urfa biber, or regular chili flakes\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n1/4 cup red wine vinegar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 375F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, a silicon baking mat, or parchment paper.\n2 Prepare the squash: Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out and discard the strings and seeds (save and roast the seeds, if you like). Cut the squash into 1-inch slices.\nToss the squash with a 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon or so of salt, and ground black pepper. Place on the prepared baking sheet.\n3 Roast the squash for 30 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork.\n4 While the squash is cooking prepare the chimichurri. In a medium bowl, stir together the olive oil, cilantro, parsley, oregano leaves, chili flakes, garlic, red wine vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Taste and add more salt if needed.\n5 Serve: Transfer the roasted squash to a serving platter or individual plates, top with a generous amount of chimichurri, and enjoy.\nHello!

With the cut sides down, place the squash on the baking sheet. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife. Remove and cool briefly.\n3 While the squash roasts, cook the rice: In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups water and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil. Add the rice and adjust the heat to a simmer. Set a lid on top, slightly askew, and cook for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the rice \xe2\x80\x9cgrains\xe2\x80\x9d are tender (some grains may begin to separate or burst). Drain in a sieve or fine-mesh colander.\n4 Cook the turkey and vegetables: In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the turkey and break it up into tablespoon-sized clumps using a stiff spatula or wooden spoon. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring often to further break up the meat, until it begins to brown.\nAdd the shallot, celery, apple, sage, rosemary, cranberries, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Cook and stir for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables soften.\nIf the pan seems dry, add up to 1/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and stir to scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the skillet until the water evaporates. Stir in the cooked rice. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if you like.\n5 Stuff the squash: Turn the squash on the baking sheet so the cut side is up. Divide the filling between the halves.\n6 Bake the squash: In a small bowl, mix the breadcrumbs with 1 teaspoon of oil. Sprinkle on top of the squash halves.\nBake for 10 minutes, or until hot all the way through and the breadcrumbs are browned.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nRed Chile Marinated Grilled Chicken Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hourMarinating time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4-6\nMaking the sauce from scratch, our chicken ended up quite spicy hot, almost like jerk chicken. Using canned sauce as a base, even one with medium heat, most of the heat was lost in the cooking process. If you like your chicken spicy hot, and you are using a canned sauce, I recommend starting with one that is graded "hot".\nINGREDIENTS\n3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts, preferably thighs, trimmed of excess skin and fat\nSalt\n1 1/4 cup Mexican red chili sauce, either homemade* or canned (if you are gluten intolerant and are using canned chili sauce, make sure to read the ingredients on the can, some makers put wheat products in their sauce)\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons white or cider vinegar\n1/2 teaspoon ground cloves\n1/2 teaspoon ground allspice\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon ground cumin\nA couple of turns on a black pepper grinder\nA pinch of dried oregano, crushed\n1 teaspoon minced garlic\nGarnish\nAvocado slices\nThinly sliced lettuce or cabbage\nThinly sliced radishes\nCilantro\n* To make your own homemade sauce, take 2 ancho and 2 guajillo chiles, open them up, remove the stems, seeds, and ribs. Lightly toast the chiles on a medium griddle or cast iron pan for a minute or two, flattening them down with a metal spatula. Place the chiles in a saucepan, cover with water, bring to a boil, remove from heat and let soak for 10-15 minutes, until chiles are softened. Place chiles, 1 1/4 cup of the soaking water, 1 clove of garlic, a pinch of salt, in a blender. Blend until completely smooth. Put mixture through a strainer to strain out any solids. Proceed with the recipe, but don\'t add any more garlic to the sauce.\nMETHOD\n1 Simmer chili sauce and spices to make the marinade: Heat oil in a medium sized saucepan on medium heat. Add the chili sauce. Add vinegar (2 Tbsp if using canned sauce, 4 Tbsp in you\'ve made your own sauce), cloves, allspice, cinnamon, cumin, black pepper, oregano and garlic.\nBring to a simmer and let simmer for 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let cool.\n2 Marinate chicken: Sprinkle salt over all the chicken pieces on all sides. Put chicken pieces in a non-reactive bowl or a large freezer bag. Add the marinade, make sure all pieces are coated well with the marinade.\nMarinate in the refrigerator at least one hour, preferably overnight.\n3 Grilling Instructions: Remove the chicken from the refrigerator before starting up the grill. Preheat your grill, allowing for a space on the grill for cooking the chicken with indirect heat. (If using coals, move all the coals to one side of the grill, if using gas, after the grill is hot, turn off one of the burners.)\nBrush the grill grates with olive oil. Make sure the chicken pieces are well coated on all sides with the paste-like marinade.\nPlace the chicken pieces on the indirect heat part of the grill (not over a flame or coals). Cook, covered, for 25-30 minutes, turning the pieces over after the first 15 minutes. Try to keep the temperature in the grill around 350\xc2\xb0F. Chicken is done when juices run clear, breasts have an internal temperature of 165\xc2\xb0F and thighs 175\xc2\xb0F.\n3a Roasting Instructions: If you aren\'t in a grilling mood, you can roast the chicken pieces in the oven. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Place the chicken pieces in a roasting pan, skin-side up. Cook for about 45-50 minutes, until breasts have an internal temperature of 165\xc2\xb0F and thighs 175\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Serve with garnishes: Serve garnished with sliced avocado, sliced lettuce or cabbage dressed with a little vinegar and oil, sliced radishes and cilantro.\nMakes for great leftover chicken to cut up and put into tacos.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nMexican Red Chili Sauce Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Makes a little more than 1 cup\nINGREDIENTS\n3 dried Ancho (sometimes called pasilla in the US*) chiles OR 2 Ancho and 2 Guajillo chiles\nWater\n1 large clove garlic\n2 black peppercorns, crushed\nA pinch of ground cloves\n1/2 teaspoon of salt, more to taste\nExtra virgin olive oil\n* According to Diana Kennedy, Pasilla chilies are a long and skinny variety of chile, while Ancho chilies (dried poblanos) are shorter and wider. However, in certain parts of Michoacan, Mexico, the Ancho chile is called Pasilla, and because of immigration, is commonly known as Pasilla in many parts of the US.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cut the chiles open and remove stem and seeds: Working on one chile at a time, use a paring knife to cut a slit all the way down one side of a chile. Open up the chile and remove the stem and seeds. Remove as much of the veins as you can.\nReserve a few of the seeds or veins for adding later if you want added heat.\nNote when working with chilies, either wear protective gloves or wash your hands very thoroughly with soap and warm water after handling the chilies. Do not touch or rub your eyes if you have been handling chili peppers.\n2 Heat the chiles on a skillet: Heat a large skillet on medium heat. Flatten out the dried chilies as well as you can and place on the skillet to heat.\nPress down on the opened chilies and leave for a few seconds. Turn the chilies over and heat a few seconds more.\nYou do not want to toast or burn the chilies! If they burn, they'll turn bitter. Just heat them enough to draw out more of their flavor.\n3 Soften the chiles in hot water: Add the chilies to a small saucepan and add enough water so that they are just covered. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes, until the chilies have softened and plumped up.\n(OR pour place the chilies in a small saucepan and pour boiling water over them to cover. Let sit for 15 minutes, until softened.)\n4 Pur\xc3\xa9e with garlic, seasonings, water or poaching liquid: Reserving the soaking water, remove the chilies from the pan and place in a blender. Add the garlic, salt, crushed peppercorns, ground cloves, and 1 1/2 cups of the soaking liquid (taste the soaking water first, if it seems bitter, use plain water instead).\nPur\xc3\xa9e for 2 minutes, until the sauce is completely smooth. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning. If you want more heat, add in a few of the seeds or veins and pur\xc3\xa9e some more. Add more salt if needed.\n5 Strain through sieve into a skillet, simmer: Pour the sauce through a sieve into a skillet. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the sauce.\nBring to a simmer and reduce heat to maintain the simmer, cook for 10 minutes. Skim off the foam.\nRemove from heat. Use immediately or pour into a glass jar (plastic will get stained) and refrigerate.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Put into a mortar and pestle and grind until powdery.\n3 Make the chermoula sauce: Put 4 cloves garlic, parsley, cilantro, salt, cumin, coriander, paprika, and lemon zest in a food processor. Pulse several times. With the motor running, slowly add in 1/2 cup of olive oil, then the lemon juice. Process until you have a smooth paste.

Let them cook until deep golden brown, about 5 to 6 minutes.\nThen turn them over and cook a few minutes more.\n5 Drain excess fat: Because you are working with skin-on thighs, you will likely render quite a bit of fat. Remove the chicken from the pan and pour off any excess fat. (Do not pour down the drain unless you want to clog your drain pipes.) Return the chicken to the pan.\n5 Spread chermoula on chicken, bake in oven: Spread most of the chermoula sauce on both sides of the chicken thighs, reserving 1/4 cup of the fresh sauce to add later.\nWith the chicken skin-side up, put the skillet in the 350\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the thighs are cooked through and the temperature near the bone is 165\xc2\xb0F when tested with a meat thermometer.\n6 Spoon remaining sauce over chicken: Stir the reserved fresh chermoula sauce in with the pan sauce. Spoon sauce over the chicken to serve.\nServe with couscous or with basmati rice for a gluten-free option.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nAir Fryer Chicken Wings Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hourOptional Refrigeration time: 6 hours\nThe baking powder trick yields super-crispy wings and is worth planning ahead. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll still have delicious wings without it: Omit the baking powder, but still season the wings with the kosher salt before air-frying them.\nIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t find gochujang, try another favorite sauce for chicken wings and use the same air fryer method.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the wings:\n3 pounds chicken wing drumettes and flats\n3 teaspoons baking powder\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\nFor the sauce:\n2 tablespoons gochujang\n2 tablespoons soy sauce\n1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar\n2 teaspoons sesame oil\n1 teaspoon sugar\n3 tablespoons butter, melted and kept warm\nFor the sesame mayonnaise dipping sauce:\n1 cup mayonnaise\n1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil\n3/4 teaspoon sugar\n1/8 teaspoon sriracha\nTo garnish:\nThinly sliced scallions, for garnish\nToasted sesame seeds, for garnish\nThin spears of cucumber\nThin slices of radish\nSpecial equipment:\nAir Fryer\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Season and rest the wings: Pat the wings dry, if needed. In a large bowl, add the wings and toss them with the baking powder and salt until evenly coated.\nSpread the wings around the bowl so they are in a single layer and refrigerate them, uncovered, for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours.\n2 Air fry the wings: Heat the air fryer to 380\xc2\xb0F. Open the drawer and fit as many wings as you can in it without crowding them (for my 4.4-quart air fryer, this was 1-1/2 pounds of wings, or half the batch). Close the drawer. Cook for 25 minutes, shaking the drawer every 5 minutes to shuffle the wings around.\n3 Make the sauce: As the wings cook, make the sauce. In a medium bowl, whisk together the gochujang, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, and sugar. Set aside.\n4 Make the sesame mayonnaise: In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sesame oil, sugar, and sriracha until smooth. Set aside.\n5 Increase the air fryer temp: Once the wings have cooked for 25 minutes, increase the temperature of the air fryer to 400\xc2\xb0F. Cook the wings for another 5 minutes. This gets them nice and brown and especially crispy.\n6 Sauce and serve the wings: Mix the melted butter with the sauce (it might solidify a bit, but the heat of the wings will re-melt it). Add the wings to a large bowl, pour over half the sauce and toss the wings in the sauce.\n7 Serve and eat: Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds, if you like. Serve immediately, accompanied by the cucumbers, radishes, and sesame mayonnaise for dipping.\n8 Cook the remaining wings: Reduce the temperature of your air fryer back to 380\xc2\xb0F. Repeat steps 2 and 4. Toss them with the remaining sauce.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nAir Fryer Fried Chicken Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 45 minutesMarinating time: 1 hourYield: 10 pieces of fried chicken\nAlternative Pan Fry Method: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to an air fryer, you can make this fried chicken using a traditional pan fry method. Add enough oil to a cast iron skillet so the oil is about 1 1/2 inches up the side of the skillet. Heat oil until it reaches 350\xc2\xb0F. Add chicken pieces and fry for 8 minutes. Flip, and fry for another 8 minutes until golden brown. Test temperature; you might need a few more minutes for the dark meat pieces (thighs and legs).\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the chicken: \n1 4-pound fryer chicken, cut into 10 pieces (2 breasts cut in half, 2 wings, 2 legs, 2 thighs)\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 cups buttermilk\nFor the coating:\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 tablespoon seasoned salt\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon garlic powder\n1 tablespoon paprika\nSpray olive oil for cooking\nSpecial equipment:\nKrups Air Fryer\nThermapen Instant Read Thermometer\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Marinate the chicken: Season the chicken well with salt and pepper and then add it to a bowl with buttermilk. Chicken pieces should be covered with the buttermilk. Let it sit for at least an hour or up to overnight.\n2 Bread the chicken: To prepare the breading mixture, stir together flour, seasoned salt, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika.\nRemove chicken pieces from buttermilk and shake off any excess; then dip in the flour mix and coat well. Transfer breaded chicken pieces to a clean plate or wire rack to rest.\n3 Air-fry the chicken: You will need to work in two batches if you are doing a full chicken. Spray the basket of your air fryer with nonstick spray. Place half of the pieces in the basket of your air fryer. Try to ensure the pieces don\xe2\x80\x99t touch. Air needs to circulate around them.\nSpray the chicken pieces lightly with spray oil. Place the basket in the air fryer and turn the air fryer to 350\xc2\xb0F. Cook for 14 minutes, then flip the fried chicken with tongs, spray lightly with oil a second time on the bottom side of the chicken, and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes.\nThe half-breast pieces and the wings will be done on the low end of that time range, and the dark meat pieces will need a full 24 to 26 minutes of time to be cooked through. The dark meat pieces should reach 175\xcb\x9aF.\n(NOTE: My method photo here only shows the temp at 148\xcb\x9aF to illustrate that the chicken can LOOK cooked but is actually not cooked through. A meat thermometer is vital.)\nDuring the air frying process, if you pull out the chicken and notice any dry flour spots on the chicken, spray those spots lightly with oil. The breading will never crisp up if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a tiny bit of oil to hydrate it. It will just burn.\n4 Serve: When the fried chicken is ready, let it rest on a plate for a few minutes before serving. Serve immediately with salad, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, or your favorite fried chicken sides!\nCooked fried chicken can be stored in the fridge for 5 days and reheated in a 300\xc2\xb0F oven for 8 to 10 minutes.\nHello!

Stirring frequently, cook the cranberries for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they've reduced a bit and thickened to a jelly-like consistency.\nRemove the pan from the stove and add the light brown sugar. Stir constantly to dissolve the sugar and coat the cranberries in a thick glaze.\nAllow the cranberries to cool to room temperature, leaving the spices in it.\n4. Prep your Air Fryer: Set your Cuisinart\xc2\xae Air Fryer Toaster Oven\xe2\x80\x99s function dial to Air Fry and the temperature dial to 300\xc2\xb0F. Remove both the Air Fryer basket and the baking pan from the oven, then turn the on/oven dial to 10 minutes to preheat the oven.\n5. Fill the phyllo cups: While your Air Fryer is heating, fill your phyllo shells with the pieces of brie. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to leave the shells in the packaging while you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to fill them. Remove the shells from the plastic packaging and arrange them, a dozen at a time, in the Air Fryer basket.\n6. Bake the shells: Place the baking pan, with the Air Fryer basket nestled inside, into the oven in position 1. Bake the shells for five minutes.\nOnce the shells have finished baking, remove them from the Air Fryer Toaster Oven and carefully remove them from the basket. Repeat this step, baking the shells by the dozen, until they are all baked.\n7. Prep the rosemary topping: While the shells are baking, pick off the remaining rosemary leaves in clusters of two or three leaves. Set aside to garnish the canap\xc3\xa9s when you\xe2\x80\x99re done topping them with the sauce.\n8. Top with cranberry sauce and garnish: Once you have baked all of the brie-filled shells, top each with a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, leaving the cinnamon stick, vanilla bean (if you used one), rosemary sprigs and slices of ginger in the pan. Pull out any pieces of rosemary orAny remaining cranberry sauce may be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.\nGarnish the top of each canap\xc3\xa9 with the sprigs of rosemary leaves you picked earlier.\n9. Serve! These canap\xc3\xa9s are best served immediately, but can be held at room temperature for up to 2 hours.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Store covered in the refrigerator until ready to serve. You can do this up to 48 hours in advance.\n2 Peel and cut the plantains: Remove the ends of the green plantains with a sharp knife. Score the plantain down its back side and use the fleshy part of your thumbs to push the peel up and away from the plantain.\n3 Preheat your air fryer to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Soak the plaintains: Combine 4 cups of cold water and 1 tablespoon of kosher salt. Slice the plantain into 1 1/2-inch-thick chunks and soak them in water for 20 minutes. (Soaking the plantains prevents browning and keeps the air-fried plantains from drying out while cooking.\n5 Dry then par-fry the plantains: Remove the plantains from the water and dry each one thoroughly. Toss the plantain slices in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil. Make sure each plantain is coated in a thin layer of the oil.\nTransfer the plantains to your air fryer\xe2\x80\x99s basket. Organize in a single layer, leaving a 1/2 inch of space on all sides of the slices to allow the air to circulate properly. Fry until the plantain offers no resistance when pierced with the tip of a knife.

b"Save It Print\nMexican Wedding Cookies Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 18 minutesChilling time: 1 hourYield: 24 to 30 cookies\nYou can substitute any other nut in place of the pecans. Times for toasting in Step 1 will vary based on the size of the nut you use.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the cookie dough:\n1 cup (115 g) pecan pieces\n1 cup (225 g or 2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature\n3/4 cup (85 g) powdered sugar, sifted\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n2 cups (280 g) all-purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\nTo roll the cookies:\n1 1/4 cup (145 g) powdered sugar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toast the nuts on the stovetop: Place the nuts in a medium skillet and place over medium heat. Toast the nuts, stirring frequently, until they darken slightly and smell fragrant and nutty, about 5 minutes.\nRemove the pan from heat and let the nuts cool in the pan.\n2 Crush the nuts: Once the toasted nuts are warm to the touch, but not hot, pour them into a quart-size sealable freezer bag. Seal the bag, and then use a rolling pin to roll and crush the nuts until they are crushed into a chunky powder. Set aside until needed.\n(Alternatively, pulse in a food processor until powdery. Be careful of over-processing or the nuts will turn into nut butter!)\n3 Mix the butter and sugar: Place the butter and 3/4 cup powdered sugar in the bowl of stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Beat together on medium speed until the sugar is absorbed into the butter and the buttery paste clings to the side of the bowl. Add the vanilla and beat for an additional 30 seconds to incorporate.\n4 Add the flour and salt: Mix on low speed. As the dry ingredients start to absorb into the butter-sugar mixture, you can increase the speed back to medium. Once all the flour is mixed in and a dough has formed, stop the mixer.\n5 Empty the crushed nuts into the bowl with the dough: Mix on low speed to incorporate.\n6 Chill the dough: Scrape the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and flatten into a disk about 1-inch thick. Wrap tightly with the plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or until the dough is firm.\n7 About 10 minutes before you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350F. Line 2 baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon baking mat.\n8 Roll the cookies: Place the 1 1/4 cups of powdered sugar for coating the cookies into a shallow bowl. Remove the chilled dough out of the refrigerator and form into 1-inch balls of dough. (If your dough chilled longer than 1 hour, you may need to let it soften for a few minutes at room temperature.)\nRoll the balls of dough in powdered sugar and place on the baking mat, spaced slightly apart.\n9 Bake for 17 to 19 minutes, or until the cookies start to brown slightly on top and are golden brown on the bottoms. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes after baking.\n10 While the cookies are still warm, roll each cookie in the powdered sugar again. Return the cookies to the cooling rack and let cool completely before serving.\nStore at room temperature in an airtight container. They will keep well for at least a week.\nHello!

b'Print\nChocolate Florentine Cookies Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesBake time: 8 minutes per batchYield: 30 florentine cookies\nFlorentine cookies are crisp almond toffee-like cookies that are sandwiched with a layer of chocolate and then drizzled with more chocolate. They have a reputation for being difficult to make but I\xe2\x80\x99ve given some hints and tips on making them easier for you. Just make sure to watch them bake, as they can go from done to burnt fairly quickly.\nMaking these cookies goes more quickly if you have at least two baking sheets so that you can prep the next batch while the previous batch is in the oven.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the cookies:\n2 1/2 cups (290 g) slivered almonds\n1/4 cup (35 g) all-purpose flour\n2 tablespoons natural cocoa powder (not Dutch-process)\n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional but recommended)\n3/4 cup (150 g) white granulated sugar\n1/2 cup (1 stick or 115 g) unsalted butter\n1/4 cup heavy cream\n2 tablespoon honey\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\nTo finish:\n8 to 10 ounces of dark chocolate, chopped\nSpecial equipment:\nFood processor\nSilpat or other silicon baking mat\nThin, flat spatula\nWire cooling rack\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Chop the almonds: Place the slivered almonds in a food processor. Pulse until the almonds are broken down into smaller bits, about 1/4 inch in size. They should be the size of the chopped nuts you would sprinkle over an ice cream sundae.\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a food processor, you can chop the nuts by hand or place them in a ziplock bag and crush them with a wooden rolling pin until they are the right size.\n2 Add the flour and cocoa powder to the food processor bowl. Pulse a couple of times to blend together.\n3 Make the cookie "batter" on the stovetop: In a medium-sized saucepan, place the sugar, butter, cream, and honey. Heat until the sugar is dissolved and the butter has melted. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.\nAdd the dry almond mixture and stir until incorporated. Set aside to cool for 20 minutes.\n4 Preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xbaF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon baking mat.\n5 Spoon out the cookies: Once the batter has cooled (it will still be warm), use a teaspoon measure to spoon out the cookies onto the prepared baking sheet (1 teaspoon per cookie). Space the cookies about 3 inches apart; they will spread a lot during baking. (On a 12 x 18 sheet, I found 6 cookies fit comfortably.)\n6 Flatten the cookies: Dip your finger in some water, then use it to spread the batter into a round circle, with the nuts in a single layer on the pan. This will encourage the batter to spread evenly in a circle.\n7 Bake the cookies: Bake the cookies in the oven for 6 to 8 minutes. If you are using parchment paper, the cookies will bake faster. If you are using a silicon baking sheet, the silicon insulates the heat and it takes a little long to bake (but they will bake more evenly).\nRemove the pan from the oven once the edges of the cookies start to darken and brown and transfer to a cooling rack. Be careful as the cookies go from done to burnt fairly fast.\nWhile the cookies are still warm from the oven, take a look at them and see if any of them are not quite round. If they are not as nicely shaped as you would like, use a spatula to carefully nudge the sides of the cookie into a round circle. You will have to work fairly quickly as the cookies firm up as they cool.\n8 Cool the cookies: Let the cookies cool on the pan for 10 to 20 minutes, until they are set. It\'s fine if they\'re still a little soft, but they should be able to be transferred in one piece without tearing or creating ripples in the cookie.\nIt helps to use a very thin, flat spatula so you can easily slide under each cookie. Also, if you have a wire rack that has crisscross wires, this is ideal for cookies like this since any under-baked cookie will slump a little bit on racks with more widely-spaced wires. Let the cookies cool completely.\n9 Continue baking the cookies in batches until all the batter has been used.\n10 Sandwich the cookies with chocolate: Once the cookies have all been baked and cooled, melt dark chocolate by placing it in a microwave-safe bowl and cooking it in 30 second increments, stirring between each increment. (You can also melt the chocolate on a double boiler, if you prefer.)\nOnce the chocolate has melted, pick two cookies that are roughly the same size and smear a thin layer of chocolate on the bottom of one of them. Place the matching cookie bottom on top and set the cookie sandwich on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a wire rack.\nRepeat with the remaining cookies. Drizzle any remaining chocolate over the Florentines.\n11 Wait for the chocolate to firm up and harden before serving or packaging. Stored in an airtight container, these cookies will keep at room temperature for 3 days, or in the fridge for about 2 weeks.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nFlourless Lemon Almond Cake Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Serves 8\nIt helps to separate the eggs first, while they are cold, and then let them sit to come to room temperature as you prep the other ingredients.  Eggs are easier to separate when cold, and they perform better as leavening agents when at room temperature.\nWhen whipping egg whites, make sure your equipment is perfectly clean. Any fat (or even bits of egg yolk in the whites) can keep the egg whites from properly whipping up.\nIf almond flour is not available at your market, you can grind up blanched, slivered almonds in a food processor until very finely ground.  I would start with a little more than 1 1/3 cups. Our local Whole Foods carries a Bob's Red Mill brand of finely ground blanched almond flour which is what we used for this recipe.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 eggs (large), separated into 4 egg yolks and 4 egg whites, room temperature (see how to separate eggs)\n2 Tbsp lemon zest, packed\n1/2 cup (100 g) white sugar, divided 1/4 cup (50 g) and 1/4 cup (50 g)\n1 1/2 cup lightly scooped (144 g) finely ground blanched almond flour\n1 teaspoon baking powder (make sure your baking powder is fresh!)\n1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom\n1 teaspoon white or cider vinegar\nPinch of salt\nPowdered sugar for sprinkling\nSpecial equipment:\n8 or 9-inch springform pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven, prepare pan: Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175 \xc2\xb0C).  Place a round of parchment paper on the bottom of a 8 or 9-inch springform pan, and grease it and the sides of the pan with butter or cooking spray.\n2 Beat egg yolks, lemon zest, 1/4 cup sugar: In a large bowl, beat together with a wooden spoon the egg yolks, lemon zest, and 1/4 cup sugar until smooth.\n3 Whisk almond flour, baking powder, cardamom, beat into egg yolk mixture: In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond flour, ground cardamom, and baking powder. Add the flour mixture to the egg yolk mixture and beat until well combined. The mixture should resemble a thick paste.\n4 Whip egg whites to soft peaks: With an electric mixer with a very clean bowl and clean whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, starting on low speed and gradually increasing the speed.\nWhen bubbles start to form, add a pinch of salt and the teaspoon of vinegar (both the salt and the vinegar will help the beaten egg whites maintain better structure, as will the sugar in the next step).\nAs the egg whites begin to increase in volume, sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, a little at a time, as you continue to beat the egg whites. Beat until soft peaks form.\n5 Fold beaten egg whites into almond mixture: Stir a third to a half of the beaten egg whites into the almond mixture to loosen it and make it lighter.\nThen gently fold the remaining whipped egg whites into the batter, a large scoopful at a time.\n6 Scoop batter into pan, bake: Gently scoop the batter into the prepared springform pan and place in the oven. Bake at 350\xc2\xb0F (175 \xc2\xb0C) for 30 minutes.\nRemove from the oven and let cool. Run a sharp knife around the edge of the cake helping it to separate from the side of the pan.\nRelease the springform pan sides, and gently move the cake (on parchment) to a cake serving plate. Sprinkle with a little powdered sugar before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"

Add the cut up pieces of butter and use a pastry cutter to cut into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are no bigger than a pea. (You can use a food processor for this if you want.)\nSprinkle with vanilla and add 3 tablespoons of ice water. Use a fork to work the water and vanilla into the dough. (You can use a food processor.) Add up to a tablespoon more of ice water, just enough so that the dough easily sticks together when you pinch it with your fingers.\nForm the dough into a ball, kneading once or twice if necessary, and flatten into a disk. Wrap the dough disk in plastic and chill for 1 hour.\n2 Roll out the dough, place in tart pan, freeze: Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xb0F (190\xc2\xb0C). Remove dough from refrigerator and let sit for 10 minutes. Place the dough on a lightly floured clean surface. Roll out the dough to a 12-inch round. Place the dough in a 9 1/2-inch-diameter tart pan with a removable bottom.\nPress the dough down and into the sides. Roll the rolling pin over the top of the tart pan to even off the top edges.\nPierce the bottom of the dough in the tart pan all over with fork. Freeze for 30 minutes.\n3 Pre-bake the crust: Bake the crust at 375\xc2\xb0F for 20 minutes, piercing the bottom with fork if bubbles form. Transfer to a rack to cool.\n4 Make the caramel nut filling: Put sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan with high sides. Heat on medium-low heat and stir until sugar dissolves.\nOnce the sugar has dissolved, increase the heat to medium high. Boil without stirring until caramel is deep amber color, occasionally swirling the pan, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium.\nSlowly stir in the cream. Be careful as the mixture will bubble up significantly (this is why we are using a high sided pot). Stir until the caramel is smooth.\nAdd the butter, honey and vanilla. Stir until the butter has all melted.\nStir in all of the nuts.\n5 Bake: Pour caramel mixture into the pre-baked crust. Bake at 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C) 20 minutes.

b"Save It Print\nHomemade Almond Roca Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 20 minutes\nUse an inexpensive chocolate such as Hershey's. It has low cocoa butter content. If you use a premium chocolate with a high cocoa butter content, unless you temper the chocolate first (look up directions online), the cocoa butter may separate into white streaks as the melted chocolate cools.\nYou can use other kinds of nuts such as pecans or macadamia and white chocolate.\nDo not attempt to make this on a humid or rainy day. Do not double the recipe, make one batch at a time.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup sugar\n1/4 cup water\n1 Tbsp light corn syrup\n1/2 lb butter (2 sticks - NO substitutes!)\n1/2 lb. slivered almonds (2 cups)\n1/2 lb. bar of regular Hershey's dark chocolate (7 oz okay)\nMETHOD\n1 Melt butter with sugar, syrup and water in a pan (such as a large non-stick frying pan) on medium to medium-high temperature. Stir continuously with a wooden spoon.\nWhen butter is melted, add the almonds.\n2 Cook until the mixture turns a warm amber color, and the boiling sounds like a crackle: When mixture comes to a rolling boil, set your timer for a minimum of 10 minutes and keep stirring (no more than 15 minutes). The mixture will thicken and turn darker in color. The almonds will roast.\nKeep stirring and cooking until you hear it crackle. If you don't cook it long enough it will not harden, so keep stirring and listen for the crackling sound.\nElise's note: I have found it very hard to distinguish between the boiling sound and the crackling sound in this recipe. A better guideline for me is by color. When the mixture turns a warm amber color, at about 11 or 12 minutes into the boiling, that's the time to pour it out. Wait too long and it will burn.\nIf you try to make this, please read all the comments listed below. It's actually trickier than one would think.\n3 Pour mixture out onto a large cookie sheet: When the mixture crackles, pour the mixture out onto a large sheet pan or cookie sheet and spread it as thin as possible with a fork.\n4 Spread chocolate over the top: While the almond mixture is still hot, break up the chocolate into chunks and distribute it over the almond mixture and let it melt. Spread it evenly on the top.\n5 Cool to room temp: Let the almond roca cool to room temperature. When cool you can lift the whole thing off the pan and break into small pieces.\nHello!

Depending on the original size of the sheet, you will cut it into squares or rectangles. Remember, this is fancy but rustic, so the exact size of the tarts is flexible!\nINGREDIENTS\n1 sheet all-butter puff pastry (14 to 16 ounces), thawed\n1 cup almond flour\n1/2 cup sugar\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into slices\n1 large egg\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n1 tablespoon amaretto or 1 teaspoon pure almond extract\n1 teaspoon vanilla\n1 1/2 pounds (about 4 medium) ripe peaches, cut into 1-inch wedges\n2 tablespoons turbinado sugar\n3 tablespoons apple jelly or apricot jam\n1 tablespoon water\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven: Line a baking sheet with parchment and preheat the oven to 375\xc2\xbaF.\n2 Prepare the dough: On a lightly floured work surface, unfold the puff pastry. Lightly roll it with a rolling pin to even it out if there are any gaps or wrinkles. Transfer the dough to the parchment-lined baking sheet.\nWith a pizza cutter or knife, cut the dough into 9 pieces to make four-inch squares or similar size rectangles. The exact size depends upon the original shape of the dough. Spread them apart on the baking sheet. Refrigerate while you make the filling.\n3 Make the frangipane: In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, pulse the almond flour, sugar, and salt for a few seconds to mix. Add the butter pieces and pulse until the butter is incorporated with no large visible pieces.\nAdd the egg, all-purpose flour, amaretto (or almond extract), and vanilla and process until the frangipane is smooth. It should have the consistency of natural almond butter, thick but runny.\n4 Assemble the tarts: On each square of pastry, spoon about 1 tablespoon of the frangipane. It will spread out naturally on the pastry, and even further once you add peaches. If some spills over the edges that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. If your frangipane doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spread, feel free to push it around the tart with the back of your spoon. You may have some frangipane left over, depending on the size of your pastry squares.\nSet 5 to 6 wedges of fruit on top of each tart\xe2\x80\x94no need to be too fussy about their arrangement. Sprinkle each with the turbinado sugar.\n5 Bake the tarts: Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the peaches are soft and the frangipane and pastry are golden.\n6 Glaze the tarts: In a small microwave-safe bowl, heat the jelly or jam and water for 30 seconds, or until liquefied.

The pieces should look like a rough crumble.\nAdd the cocoa powder, maple syrup, almond butter, vanilla extract, and sea salt and pulse until the mixture is smooth and thick; it will start to peel away from the edge of the bowl.\nWhen this happens, stop the food processor; if it keeps whirring away, it may get stuck because these ingredients are, well, sticky! Keep a close eye on this, as it will come together quickly.\n2 Add the almonds: Add the almonds and pulse a few times to incorporate them. You want them sort of irregularly sized, so that some pieces are still pretty crunchy and offer a variety of textures.\n3 Roll the date balls: Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or wax paper. Place the coconut in a small bowl and the cocoa powder in another bowl.\nUsing a cookie scoop measuring about 1 1/2 tablespoons (like this one) and sprayed with cooking spray for easy release, scoop out the mixture, roll it into golf-ball shapes, and roll in the shredded coconut or the cocoa powder. (I usually do some in coconut and some in cocoa powder, and leave some plain.)\n4 Chill and store the date balls: Transfer the date balls to the baking sheet and chill them for a few hours or overnight, if needed. Once they've firmed up, transfer to a plastic lidded container and keep in the fridge for several weeks, but I've never, ever, had them last that long. They are usually consumed too quickly.\nHello!

Stir in the julienned or grated apple.\n3 Pour the batter into the pan and bake the cake: Pour the batter into the cake pan, taking care not to move the parchment around. Spread out the batter in an even layer using an offset spatula or butter knife, then tap the cake pan against the countertop to remove any air bubbles.\n4 Bake the cake: Bake the cake for 30 minutes, until it is browned around the edges and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. You may also use a probe thermometer to test for doneness\xe2\x80\x94the center of the cake should be 210\xc2\xbaF.\n5 While the cake is baking, make the glaze and toast the almonds: In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, honey, and almond milk. Cover the bowl and set it aside until needed.\nToast the sliced almonds in a skillet over medium heat until they are lightly browned, about five minutes. Shake the pan often so that the almonds are browned evenly. When they are done, immediately transfer to bowl to cool.\n6 Transfer the cake to a cooling rack: Allow the finished cake rest for 5 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pan to and invert the cake to a cooling rack. Peel the parchment off the bottom of the cake and flip it right side up.\n7 While the cake is still warm, pour the glaze over the top. Spread the glaze so that it drips over the edges of the cake. While the glaze is still wet, sprinkle the almonds on top.\n8 Let the cake cool to room temperature and serve. The cake can also be made and glazed up to a day ahead.\nHello!

b'Print\nSopa Seca de Fideo with Tomatillos Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4\nIf you want, you can substitute a cup of prepared tomatillo salsa verde for the sauce you make in step one. The original recipe calls for using Hoja Santa cheese, which is goat cheese wrapped in aromatic Hoja Santa leaves. It\'s a lovely cheese to use if you can find it, otherwise regular goat cheese will do.\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4 pound tomatillos (about 6 medium sized), husks removed\n1 to 2 serrano chiles\n1/4 medium onion\n1 clove garlic\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, plus extra for garnish\n4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided\n4 ounces fresh Mexican chorizo, casing removed, crumbled\n8 ounces capellini, or angel hair pasta, broken into 1 to 1 1/2-inch pieces\n1 teaspoon sea salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n2 1/2 cups chicken stock\n4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled\n1 avocado, seeded, peeled, diced\nCrema fresca or sour cream\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Broil tomatillos, chiles, onion: Place the tomatillos, serrano chiles, an quarter onion on a baking sheet lightly greased with olive oil. Broil for about 15 minutes until somewhat charred and blistered. Remove the stems from the serranos.\n2 Make tomatillo sauce: Working in batches if necessary, pur\xc3\xa9e the chiles, tomatillos, onion, a clove of garlic, and 2 tablespoons of the chopped cilantro in a blender, making sure not to fill the blender more than halfway. Once blended you should have about a cup of sauce.\n3 Cook the chorizo: Heat 2 Tbsp of oil in a large saucepan on medium heat. Add the chorizo and cook 3 to 4 minutes until cooked through and crispy. Use a wooden spoon to crumble up the chorizo as it cooks.\nUse a slotted spoon to remove the chorizo to a paper-towel lined plate, keeping the fat and oil in the pan.\n4 Brown the dry noodles: Place the broken up dry pasta into the pan and increase the heat to medium high. Lightly brown the dry noodles in the chorizo oil. Remove the pasta from the pan and set aside.\n5 Cook the tomatillo sauce: Add the remaining 2 Tbsp of oil to the pan and heat on medium high heat. Add the tomatillo sauce and the salt. The sauce should bubble up from the heat of the pan. Cook for about a minute, allowing the sauce to reduce by about a quarter cup. Dragging your spoon through the sauce should leave a trail for a second or two.\n6 Add pasta: Add the pasta back to the pan with the tomatillo sauce and cook it until it has absorbed the liquid.\n7 Add stock, simmer and cook: Add the chicken stock. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Let cook undisturbed for about 15 minutes, or until the pasta is soft and the stock absorbed. The pasta will be past "al dente" but shouldn\'t be cooked to a mush.\n8 Serve: Place in serving bowls and garnish with crumbled chorizo, goat cheese, avocado, cilantro, and crema fresca or sour cream.\nHello!

Wash your hands thoroughly after handling and do not touch your eyes or the area near your eyes with your hands for several hours.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 ripe avocados\n1/4 teaspoon of salt, more to taste\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice or lemon juice\n2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup of minced red onion or thinly sliced green onion\n1-2 serrano chiles, stems and seeds removed, minced\n2 tablespoons cilantro (leaves and tender stems), finely chopped\nA dash of freshly grated black pepper\n1/2 ripe tomato, seeds and pulp removed, chopped\nRed radishes or jicama, to garnish\nTortilla chips, to serve\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cut the avocado, remove flesh: Cut the avocados in half. Remove the pit. Score the inside of the avocado with a blunt knife and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. (See How to Cut and Peel an Avocado.) Place in a bowl.\n2 Mash with a fork: Using a fork, roughly mash the avocado. (Don't overdo it! The guacamole should be a little chunky.)\n3 Add salt, lime juice, and the rest: Sprinkle with salt and lime (or lemon) juice. The acid in the lime juice will provide some balance to the richness of the avocado and will help delay the avocados from turning brown.\nAdd the chopped onion, cilantro, black pepper, and chiles. Chili peppers vary individually in their hotness. So, start with a half of one chili pepper and add to the guacamole to your desired degree of hotness.\nRemember that much of this is done to taste because of the variability in the fresh ingredients. Start with this recipe and adjust to your taste.\nChilling tomatoes hurts their flavor, so if you want to add chopped tomato to your guacamole, add it just before serving.\n4 Serve: Serve immediately, or if making a few hours ahead, place plastic wrap on the surface of the guacamole and press down to cover it and to prevent air reaching it. (The oxygen in the air causes oxidation which will turn the guacamole brown.) Refrigerate until ready to serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Be careful while handling the chile peppers. Use a plastic baggie or disposable gloves to handle them, or wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water after handling and avoid touching your eyes for several hours.\nSet aside some of the seeds from the peppers. If the salsa isn't hot enough, you can add a few for more heat.\n2 Make the salsa: Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade. Pulse only a few times, just enough to finely dice the ingredients and not enough to pur\xc3\xa9e. If you don't have a food processor, you can finely dice by hand.\n3 Adjust seasonings: Place in a serving bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the chilies make the salsa too hot, add some more chopped tomato. If it's not hot enough, carefully add a few of the seeds from the chilies, or add a little more ground cumin.\nLet the salsa sit for an hour (room temperature or chilled) for the flavors to combine.\n4 Serve: Serve with chips, tortillas, tacos, burritos, tostadas, quesadillas, pinto or black beans.

If you use cherry tomatoes, just quarter them, don't bother blanching or peeling them.\nINGREDIENTS\n6 or 7 ripe tomatoes (about 1 1/2 lbs)\n2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)\n1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar\n6-8 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced* or chopped\n3/4 teaspoon sea salt, more or less to taste\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more or less to taste\n1 baguette French bread or similar Italian bread\n1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil\n*To thinly slice basil leaves, stack the leaves on top of each other and roll up like a cigar. Then make thin slices from one end of the basil cigar to the other.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Blanch and peel the tomatoes: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).\nOnce the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.\nRemove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.\nCut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.\n2 Preheat oven to 450\xc2\xb0F (230\xc2\xb0C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.\n3 Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.\nStir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. Note, tomatoes love salt; you may need to add more than you expect.\n4 Toast the baguette slices: Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.\nThe baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.\nWhen the oven has reached 450\xc2\xb0F (230\xc2\xb0C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.\nIf you want you can toast the bread slices without coating them first in olive oil. Toast them until lightly browned on both sides. Then cut a clove of garlic in half and rub over one side of the toast. Then brush with olive oil. (See Easiest Ever Garlic Bread.)\n5 Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).\nEither serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

In a separate small bowl, add eggs and water and whisk together. Add the egg mixture to the bowl with the cauliflower and toss to coat. Once the cauliflower is coated with the egg mixture, toss with breadcrumbs and coat well.\n3 Air-fry the cauliflower: Spray the basket of an air fryer with nonstick spray and place as many cauliflower florets in the basket as will fit in a single layer. Return the basket to the fryer and cook at 350\xcb\x9aF for 7 minutes. Then flip the florets and fry for another 7 minutes.\nRepeat until all cauliflower is done.\n4 Serve! Serve cauliflower immediately once all batches are done, or serve on a rolling basis as the batches come out of the fryer. Cauliflower is best right out of the fryer! Serve with the blue cheese dip as an appetizer or side dish.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Save It Print\nSwedish Meatballs Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4 to 6 as a main, 8 to 12 as an appetizer\nLingonberry jelly is traditionally used with Swedish meatballs; you can substitute cranberry, red currant or raspberry jelly if you can't find lingonberry jelly.\nThis recipe serves 4 to 6 people and can easily be doubled for serving a party.\nINGREDIENTS\nMeatballs:\n1 Tbsp butter\n1/2 large yellow or white onion, peeled, grated (use the large holes of a box cheese grater)\n1/4 cup milk\n3 slices of bread, crusts removed, bread cut into cubes (2 cups of cubed bread)\n1 large egg\n3/4 pound ground beef\n1/2 pound ground pork\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg\n1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom\nSauce:\n3 Tbsp butter\n3 Tbsp flour\n2 cups beef stock\n1/4 cup sour cream (use full-fat sour cream or the sauce may curdle)\nSalt and pepper\n2 Tbsp of Lingonberry, red currant, raspberry or cranberry jelly, less or more to taste (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Soak bread in milk, shred: Place the cubed bread in a large bowl and mix with the milk. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes for the bread to absorb all of the milk. Once the bread has soaked up the milk, shred with the tines of a fork or by hand.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 grated onion: Melt the butter in a saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium-high heat. Stir in the grated onion and cook until translucent and softened, 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for a minute.\n3 Make meatball mixture with bread, onions, eggs, meat, spices: Stir the cooled onions into the milk bread mixture. Add the eggs, ground pork and beef, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cardamom. Use your (clean) hands to mix everything together until well combined.\n(If you have extra time, chilling the mixture for 20 minutes or so will make it easier to roll out the meatballs.)\n4 Form meatballs: Use your hands to form the mixture into meatballs about 1 1/4-inch to 1 1/2-inch wide and place them on a plate or sheet pan. This recipe should make about 40 meatballs. Note that the meatballs will be a bit on the wet side.\n5 Brown meatballs on all sides: Heat 3 Tbsp of butter in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. When the butter is melted and foamy, start adding some meatballs to the pan.\nWorking in batches as to not crowd the pan, slowly brown the meatballs on all sides. Use a spoon or tongs to turn them. Handle the meatballs gently so they do not break apart as you turn them.\n   Once the meatballs have browned on all sides and are just cooked through, remove them from the pan to a bowl. You'll warm the meatballs in the sauce later.\nOnce you have removed the meatballs from the pan, wipe out the butter and browned and blackened bits with a paper towel and rinse out the pan.\nWe'll want to start with fresh butter because that way we won't pick up any burnt bits from the pan, and we will be able to more accurately gauge the amount of fat in the pan for making the meatball sauce in the next step.\n6 Make a roux: To make the sauce, first make the roux. Add 3 Tbsp of fresh butter to the pan. Heat the butter in the pan on medium heat until it melts and starts to bubble up.\nSlowly whisk in 3 Tbsp of flour. Stir until smooth. Continue to stir, allowing the flour mixture to cook, several minutes, until the roux is the color of coffee-with-cream.\n   7 Add stock to roux to make sauce: When the roux has cooked to a lovely shade of light brown, slowly add the stock to the roux, stirring as you add the stock.\nThe stock will sputter at first and the roux may seize up, but keep adding the stock slowly and keep stirring. Eventually the sauce will loosen and become silky.\n8 Stir in sour cream and jelly if using: Remove the pan from heat and stir in the sour cream. If you are including jelly, either stir it in now or serve it on the side. Taste for seasonings and add more salt and pepper to taste (I use about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.)\n9 Add meatballs to sauce: Return the meatballs to the pan with the sauce and cook on low heat to warm the meatballs through for a few minutes.\n10 Serve: Serve over mashed potatoes or egg noodles. Or serve individual Swedish meatballs dipped in gravy as an appetizer.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nHow to Make Naan\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 10 minutesRise time: 6 hoursYield: 16 naan\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup lukewarm milk\n1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast\n2 teaspoons sugar\n4 cups all-purpose flour + extra for dusting\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n2 tablespoons olive oil or canola oil + extra for greasing the bowl\n1/2 cup plain yogurt\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare a bowl: Lightly grease a large bowl with a little bit of oil. You will put your dough in this bowl to let it rise. Set the bowl aside.\n2 Prepare the dough: In a Pyrex liquid measuring cup or a small mixing bowl, combine the lukewarm milk, sugar, and active dry yeast. The milk should be just warm to the touch. If it\xe2\x80\x99s too hot you can kill the yeast. Let it sit for 5 minutes.\nIn another large mixing bowl, whisk the flour and salt together. Add yogurt, oil and milk-yeast mixture. Use a wooden spoon or your hands to combine the dough. The dough should be soft and sticky at this point.\n3 Knead the dough: Dust your countertop with flour. Transfer the dough to the counter. Knead together until a soft dough forms, about 5 minutes. If the dough feels dry and is too tough to knead, add about 1-2 tablespoons of water, a little bit at a time, until the dough is easier to work with.\n4 Let the dough rise: Transfer the dough to the greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Place in a dark, warm, dry place. I place it in my oven (it\xe2\x80\x99s not on) to let it rise, but your countertop is fine. Let the dough rise for 3-4 hours or until it more than doubles in size.\n5 Punch down the dough and let it rise again: Punch the risen dough down. Knead for another minute. Return the dough to the bowl, cover it again and let it rise for another 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n6 Divide the dough: Dust your countertop with flour. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead it for another minute or two until its smooth. Divide the dough into 16 smaller balls of equal size (about 2 ounces each).\nUsing a rolling pin, roll the balls into a teardrop shape. About 2-3 inches wide, 6-7 inches long, and about 1/8 inch thick. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be perfectly uniform.\n7 Cook the naan: If using herbs or spices, sprinkle one side of the bread with those now. Brush the other side with water. Set a medium-sized heavy pan or cast iron skillet with a lid over medium-high heat.\nCheck the heat of the pan by flicking water on it. If it evaporates on contact, it\xe2\x80\x99s ready. Once the pan is hot, place the naan wet side down into the skillet.\nCover it with a lid. Let it cook for about 30 seconds or until you see bubbles on it. Flip the naan, brush it with butter or ghee, and cook it uncovered for another 10 seconds. Serve it hot.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nMussels in White Wine Sauce Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 2 as a meal, 4 as an appetizer or side dish\nWhen purchasing mussels be sure they smell like the ocean, not fishy.\nDon't buy any whose shells are cracked or open or any that refuse to close their shells when you handle or tap them, those are likely dying or dead.\nTry to cook the mussels immediately (unwrap them as soon as you get home), but if you have to wait place them in a bowl and cover them with a damp towel so they can breathe.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds mussels, scrubbed clean under running water\n1/2 cup dry white wine\n2 tablespoons butter\n1/4 cup minced shallots\n1 tablespoon minced garlic\n2 teaspoons flour (optional, omit for gluten-free version)\n1/4 cup minced parsley\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Clean and prep mussels: Put the mussels in a bowl of salted water (1 Tbsp salt per quart of water) for 10-15 minutes. Throw out any that are wide open or refuse to close when you handle them as these ones are likely dead.\nLooking over the closed mussels, see if any still have their beards (long hairy byssal threads which help anchor the mussel to surfaces) and pull them out, pulling slowly and strongly towards the hinge of the shell.\n2 Put wine, mussels in bottom of large pot, steam until mussels open: Put 1/2 cup of dry white wine in the bottom of a large pot (at least 4-quart). Add the mussels to the pot. Cover and bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. As the mussels cook, they will release their highly flavored water into the pot.\nCook until shells have opened, and the mussels are just cooked, looking steamed and soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Take care not to overcook, or the mussels will be rubbery and hard.\n3 Remove cooked mussels, save the cooking liquid: Once the mussels are cooked, carefully remove them from the pot to a bowl, one-by-one using tongs, including those that have broken loose from their shells. Do not discard the liquid in the pot!\nLet the water in the pot settle for a minute. Any grit will settle to the bottom. Gently pour out the cooking water into a measuring cup, leaving the grit in the pot to discard of later. If the water you've measured out is still a little gritty, filter out the grit using a sieve.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 shallots and garlic in butter, add flour: Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan. Add the shallots and cook a couple minutes until translucent. Add the garlic and cook a minute more. If you want your sauce to be a little thick, add a teaspoon or two of flour to the pan, stir to combine. (Otherwise skip the flour.)\n5 Add mussel cooking water to create sauce: Slowly add about a cup of the filtered mussel cooking water to the saucepan, stirring to create a smooth sauce. Add the minced parsley to the sauce.\n6 Pour sauce over mussels to serve: Place mussels in serving bowls. Pour some sauce over each bowl of mussels.\nServe immediately. Serve with crusty bread for dipping in the sauce.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"

Mix well and simmer until most of the berries have burst, about 15 minutes.\nStrain mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl, pressing the cranberry mush against the strainer with the side of a rubber spatula. (Be sure to scrape the outside of the sieve with the spatula.) Add cayenne to taste.\n2 Prepare the meatballs: While the cranberries are cooking, prepare the meatballs. In a small bowl, put the torn bread and sprinkle it with the milk. Use a fork to pulverize the bread a bit. In a large bowl, use the same fork to whisk together the ricotta and the egg until smooth. Add the ground turkey, salt, thyme, fennel seeds and milk-sprinkled bread.\nGently mix with your (clean) hands until the ingredients are all incorporated. Don't overwork the meatball mixture or the meatballs will become too dense.\n3 Gently roll out small meatballs about an 1 inch wide with the palms of your hands and set them on a baking sheet or large plate.\n4 Brown the meatballs: Heat 2 Tbsp vegetable oil in a wide saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. Working in batches, add the meatballs, taking care not to crowd the pan, and brown all over. Use a fork to gentle nudge the meatballs, turning them.\nNote that the meatballs will probably be a bit on the wet side, which may cause some splattering as you cook them in the oil. To reduce that, you may want to sprinkle some flour on the meatballs, or roll them in flour, before they go in the pan. Add more oil to the pan as needed.\n5 Add glaze and simmer: Once the meatballs are browned and the glaze has been strained, add the glaze to the pan with the meatballs. Let simmer, uncovered, until the glaze reduces a bit and the meatballs cook through, about 5 minutes.\nRemove the meatballs to a serving dish. Pour over remaining cranberry glaze. If the glaze during this process is too thick, add a little water. If too thin, let simmer a little longer.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nBacon-Wrapped Shrimp Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 10 minutesBrining time (optional) time: 30 minutesYield: Makes 12 pieces\nYou'll need about 1 strip of bacon for every 2 shrimp.\nI highly recommend brining the shrimp first. The brine will help keep the shrimp from drying out in the time it takes for the bacon to cook.\nIf grilling, I recommend using long, flat skewers which make turning the shrimp on the grill easier. If you don't have flat skewers, I've used two thin bamboo skewers (soaked in water for 30 minutes beforehand) to the same effect.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the brine (optional, but recommended):\n1/4 cup (Diamond Crystal) kosher salt (if using Morton's kosher salt, use only 3 tablespoons)\n1/4 cup sugar\n4 cups water\n1 cup ice\nFor the bacon-wrapped shrimp:\n1 pound (12 to 20 count), raw, peeled and deveined shrimp (tail on)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\nZest from 1 lime\n2 tablespoons lime juice\n1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder or chili powder (less or more to taste)\n6 to 10 strips thin bacon, cut in half (half as many pieces of bacon as there are shrimp)\nSpecial equipment:\nSkewers (for grilling) or toothpicks (for oven)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brine the shrimp (optional, but recommended): Whisk the salt, sugar, and water until the salt and sugar dissolve. Add the ice and the shrimp, and let sit for 30 minutes (no longer). Remove the shrimp from the brine.\n2 Prepare grill or preheat oven: Prepare grill on high, direct heat (if grilling) or preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. If grilling and using thin bamboo or wood skewers, soak them in water first for 30 minutes.\n3 Season the shrimp: Mix together in a small bowl the lime zest, lime juice, olive oil, and chipotle powder. Stir the shrimp into the lime chipotle mixture; make sure each piece is well coated.\n4 Partially cook the bacon: Spread the bacon pieces out over several layers of paper towels on a microwave-safe plate. Cover with another layer of paper towel. Microwave on high until the bacon fat begins to melt but the bacon is still somewhat pliable, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.\n5 Wrap the shrimp with bacon: Working one at a time, wrap a half piece of partially cooked bacon around each piece of shrimp.\n6 Prep the shrimp for cooking: If you are grilling, thread the shrimp onto skewers.\nIf you are using the oven, secure each the bacon onto the shrimp with toothpicks. Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp on a foil-lined baking pan. Brush remaining lime chipotle mixture on the outside of the bacon-wrapped shrimp.\n7 Grill or bake the shrimp: Grill uncovered for 3 minutes on each side (less or more time depending on the heat of your grill), or bake in the 400\xc2\xb0F oven for 8 to 11 minutes, or until the bacon is lightly browned and the shrimp is cooked through.\nHello!

And brie is mild in flavor, but when served with foods that are tart (such as cranberries), the creaminess is amplified. Don\xe2\x80\x99t concern yourself with removing the rind from your wheel of brie: it\xe2\x80\x99s completely edible!\nINGREDIENTS\nSpiced Cranberry Sauce\n1-inch piece of ginger, or 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger\n1 vanilla bean, or 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n1 (12-ounce) bag (about 3 1/2 cups) fresh or frozen cranberries, rinsed\n1 3-inch cinnamon stick (or 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon)\n3 sprigs of fresh rosemary, divided\nJuice of 1 naval orange (about 1 /2 cup)\n1 tablespoon of orange zest\n1/4 cup maple syrup\nPinch of kosher salt\n1/2 cup packed light brown sugar\nCanap\xc3\xa9s\n8 ounces brie cheese, cut into 1\xe2\x80\x9d cubes\n2 (1.9 ounce) boxes fully baked phyllo shells (30)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1. Prep the ginger and vanilla: Peel and then thinly slice the ginger (using the edge of a spoon is the easiest way). Use a sharp paring knife to split the vanilla bean down its length.\nOpen the vanilla bean slightly to ensure the seeds are extracted during cooking.\n2. Make the Cranberry Topping: In a 3-quart saucepan, combine the ginger, vanilla bean, cranberries, cinnamon stick, 1 sprig of rosemary, orange juice and zest, maple syrup, and the salt.\nStir the ingredients together and heat over medium-high heat for 3 minutes, or until the mixture starts to boil.\n3. Reduce the topping: Reduce the heat to low, and allow the cranberries to cook until they begin to split open. Stirring frequently, cook the cranberries for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they've reduced a bit and thickened to a jelly-like consistency.\nRemove the pan from the stove and add the light brown sugar. Stir constantly to dissolve the sugar and coat the cranberries in a thick glaze.\nAllow the cranberries to cool to room temperature, leaving the spices in it.\n4. Prep your Air Fryer: Set your Cuisinart\xc2\xae Air Fryer Toaster Oven\xe2\x80\x99s function dial to Air Fry and the temperature dial to 300\xc2\xb0F. Remove both the Air Fryer basket and the baking pan from the oven, then turn the on/oven dial to 10 minutes to preheat the oven.\n5. Fill the phyllo cups: While your Air Fryer is heating, fill your phyllo shells with the pieces of brie. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to leave the shells in the packaging while you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to fill them. Remove the shells from the plastic packaging and arrange them, a dozen at a time, in the Air Fryer basket.\n6. Bake the shells: Place the baking pan, with the Air Fryer basket nestled inside, into the oven in position 1. Bake the shells for five minutes.\nOnce the shells have finished baking, remove them from the Air Fryer Toaster Oven and carefully remove them from the basket. Repeat this step, baking the shells by the dozen, until they are all baked.\n7. Prep the rosemary topping: While the shells are baking, pick off the remaining rosemary leaves in clusters of two or three leaves. Set aside to garnish the canap\xc3\xa9s when you\xe2\x80\x99re done topping them with the sauce.\n8. Top with cranberry sauce and garnish: Once you have baked all of the brie-filled shells, top each with a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, leaving the cinnamon stick, vanilla bean (if you used one), rosemary sprigs and slices of ginger in the pan. Pull out any pieces of rosemary orAny remaining cranberry sauce may be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.\nGarnish the top of each canap\xc3\xa9 with the sprigs of rosemary leaves you picked earlier.\n9. Serve! These canap\xc3\xa9s are best served immediately, but can be held at room temperature for up to 2 hours.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Fill a saucepan with 1 inch of water and insert a steamer basket. (If you don't have a steamer basket, that's ok.)\nBring the water to a boil, gently place 6 eggs in the steamer basket or directly in the saucepan. Cover the pot. Set your timer for 15 minutes. Remove eggs and set in icy cold water to cool. For more advice, see our How to Steam Hard Boiled Eggs.

Remove from oven and place in a clean dish towel, rub to remove the outer skins.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 (8-ounce, 225 g) round of brie (we recommend President brand, it melts well)\n1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts (skins removed), lightly chopped\n1/2 cup (120 ml) sherry vinegar or apple cider vinegar\n5 Tbsp honey\nPinch of salt\n1 small sprig rosemary\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the sauce: Place the vinegar, honey, salt, and 5 or 6 needles from the rosemary sprig into a small saucepan. Stir to combine. Heat on medium high heat until simmering. Then lower the heat to low and simmer until the mixture starts to darken in color and the consistency thickens to a thin syrup, about 5 to 10 minutes. (Note if you find that you have over-reduced the sauce, resulting in hard candy not syrup, you can add water to it and heat it again.)\nRemove from heat and stir in the hazelnuts.\n2 Bake the brie: While the sauce is simmering, start on the brie. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C). Use a serrated knife to slice off the very top of the brie round, exposing the cheese on one side. Place on a parchment paper or Silpat lined baking sheet (cut side up). Bake until just soft and bubbly, about 15 minutes. (Jiggle the pan to see if the cheese has melted all the way through.)\n3 Drizzle the brie with sauce: Remove the brie from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two.

b'Save It Print\nGrilled Artichokes Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs such as rosemary, oregano, thyme\n1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, cut in half (no need to peel)\n1 bay leaf\n1 lemon, cut into wedges\n2 to 4 large globe artichokes\nSalt\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Steep herbs in warm olive oil: Place chopped fresh herbs in a small bowl (not the bay leaf), cover with olive oil. Microwave on high heat for 30 seconds (or heat oil and herbs on the stovetop until warm). Let the herbs steep in the warm olive oil while you prepare the artichokes.\n2 Prep the artichokes: Prepare a large pot with an inch of water at the bottom. Add the cut cloves of garlic and the bay leaf, and place a steamer rack in the pot.\nTo prepare the artichokes, have lemon wedges ready. If you want a nice presentation, use scissors to snip away the pointy tips of the artichoke leaves. As you trim the artichokes, rub the cut areas with juice from the lemon wedges to prevent the artichokes from turning brown from oxidation.\nUse a vegetable peeler to cut away the thick outer layer of the artichoke stems. Trim the stems to 2 inches from the base of the artichoke. Cut off and discard the top 1/2 inch of the artichokes. Cut the artichokes in half.\nUse a strong metal spoon to scoop out the fuzzy chokes and the small inner artichoke leaves. Rub lemon juice all over the inside and exposed cut areas of the artichokes.\n\n3 Steam the artichokes: Heat the water in the large pot with a steamer rack on high. When it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium high and place the artichoke halves, cut side down on the steam rack.\nCover. Steam for 20 minutes (less or more, depending on the size of the artichokes), until you can easily pull off the outer leaves, and you can pierce the heart easily with a knife.\nThe artichokes can be just a tiny bit less cooked than would be typically perfect for steamed artichokes, as you will be cooking them further on the grill.\n4 Grill the artichokes: Prepare your grill for direct, high heat. Use a pastry brush to brush the artichoke all over with the herb infused oil. Sprinkle all over with salt.\nPlace the artichoke halves cut-side-down on the grill grates. Cover, and grill for 5 to 10 minutes, until you have nice grill mark on the cut sides of the artichokes.\nTo serve, sprinkle the cut sides with more lemon juice. Serve alone or with mayonnaise, remoulade, or aioli.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

Remove from oven and place in a clean dish towel, rub to remove the outer skins.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 (8-ounce, 225 g) round of brie (we recommend President brand, it melts well)\n1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts (skins removed), lightly chopped\n1/2 cup (120 ml) sherry vinegar or apple cider vinegar\n5 Tbsp honey\nPinch of salt\n1 small sprig rosemary\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the sauce: Place the vinegar, honey, salt, and 5 or 6 needles from the rosemary sprig into a small saucepan. Stir to combine. Heat on medium high heat until simmering. Then lower the heat to low and simmer until the mixture starts to darken in color and the consistency thickens to a thin syrup, about 5 to 10 minutes. (Note if you find that you have over-reduced the sauce, resulting in hard candy not syrup, you can add water to it and heat it again.)\nRemove from heat and stir in the hazelnuts.\n2 Bake the brie: While the sauce is simmering, start on the brie. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C). Use a serrated knife to slice off the very top of the brie round, exposing the cheese on one side. Place on a parchment paper or Silpat lined baking sheet (cut side up). Bake until just soft and bubbly, about 15 minutes. (Jiggle the pan to see if the cheese has melted all the way through.)\n3 Drizzle the brie with sauce: Remove the brie from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two. Use a metal spatula (or two) to carefully transfer it to a serving dish. Drizzle the honey vinegar hazelnut sauce over the brie. Garnish with the sprig of rosemary.\nServe with sliced tart apples.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Save It Print\nTempura Fried Calamari Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hour, 15 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 4-6 as an appetizer\nThe squid rings cut from the body are easier to fry than the tentacles, which tend to clump. If you have both, fry the rings first, then the tentacles.\nDo not double the recipe. The batter needs to be kept cold and used immediately after making. So it's better to work with small batches.\nIf you want to make more, mix a second batch together after you've gone through the first batch.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound cleaned squid\n1 egg yolk\n1 cup ice cold sparkling water (the colder the better)\n1/8 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/4 cup cornstarch\n3/4 cup rice or regular flour plus more for sprinkling on squid\nPeanut oil or canola oil for frying\nSpecial equipment:\nA deep fryer\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Slice the squid tubes into rings: Slice the squid tubes into rings about 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch wide. Leave the tentacles whole.\n2 Heat oil in a deep fryer or large heavy pot: This recipe was designed for a deep-fryer, but you can also fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot (keep a lid nearby, for safety reasons) halfway with oil, about 3 inches deep. Heat the oil to 360-370\xc2\xb0F.\n3 Mix dry ingredients: While the oil is heating, mix all the dry ingredients together well.\n4 Mix sparkling water with egg yolk, then mix with dry ingredients: Once the oil has reached 360\xc2\xb0F, take the sparkling water out of the refrigerator and mix it with the egg yolk. Immediately mix it in with the dry ingredients.\nMix quickly. Do not worry if there are clumps or lumps. Over-mixing may cause the batter to become chewy when cooked.\n5 Sprinkle squid pieces with flour. Use a small sieve to lightly dust the squid pieces with rice flour or regular flour. This will help the batter adhere to the squid.\n6 Dip squid pieces in batter and fry in hot oil: Working in small batches at a time (about 6 pieces), dip the squid pieces in the batter. Pick them up one by one and gently put them in the hot oil. (Note if your fingers are coated with the batter, it will help protect them from splatter.)\nWhen the squid pieces are in the oil, use a chopstick or the handle of a wooden spoon to dislodge any squid pieces that may have become stuck from the bottom of the pot or fryer. Fry for 45 seconds to 1 minute, and remove to paper towels to drain.\nNote that when done, they will NOT be golden brown, but more of a pale yellow or tan.\nRepeat with the rest of the squid. Working in batches will help keep the oil temperature from falling too far while you are frying the squid.\n6 Serve immediately: Serve immediately with lime or lemon wedges, soy sauce, ponzu sauce, Tabasco or another hot sauce.\nOnce the cooking oil has completely cooled (after about 2 hours), strain it through a paper towel-lined sieve, and save it to reuse the next time you want to deep fry seafood.\nHello!

Let sit for 10 minutes. Then drain out the juice.\n2 Cook the shrimp: Heat a couple teaspoons of olive oil in a relatively stick-free skillet (a cast iron skillet works well for this) on medium high heat.\nAdd the shrimp and cook for half a minute on each side, and remove to a bowl.\nThe shrimp shouldn't be completely cooked through; they will continue to cook during the next step.\n3 Heat the tortillas: Wipe out the skillet with paper towels. Add a small amount of olive oil (about 1/2 a teaspoon, you could use butter as well) and heat the pan on medium high.\nPlace one flour tortilla on the skillet. Flip the tortilla over a few times, 10 seconds between flips. Air pockets should begin to form within the tortilla.\nRemove the tortilla and repeat with the second tortilla. Leave the second tortilla in the pan and reduce the heat to medium.\n4 Build the quesadilla: Sprinkle the tortilla with the grated cheese. Distribute the shrimp on top of the cheese. Add chopped onion and cilantro. Place the other tortilla on top.\nFlip the quesadilla over when the bottom tortilla is nicely toasted and the cheese has begun to melt. Remove the quesadilla from the pan when the now bottom tortilla has toasted sufficiently.\nYou can also use just one tortilla instead of two, and fold the tortilla over itself like an omelette.\n5 Cut the quesadilla into triangles: Cut like a pie into six pieces (a pizza wheel works well for this). Place on a serving plate. Serve with avocado slices and sour cream. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro. Squeeze a little lime juice over everything.\nHello!

Then de-seed them and cut them into strips.\nINGREDIENTS\nOne large, burrito-size (13-inch diameter or larger) flour tortilla\n1 Tbsp butter\n1/2 cup of grated cheddar cheese\n1 or 2 roasted green chiles, peeled, seeded, cut into strips (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat your oven to 350\xc2\xb0F with a rack in the middle.\n2 Butter a flour tortilla all the way to the edges: Place the flour tortilla on a large baking sheet (a dark baking sheet or cookie sheet will work best. Spread the butter all over the top of the tortilla, all the way to the edges. The butter is important for the flavor of a cheese crisp, so don't leave it out!\n3 Bake the tortilla until lightly toasted: Bake the plain buttered tortilla for about 6 minutes or until it begins to get lightly toasted. (Check on the timing for your particular oven.)\n4 Sprinkle with cheese, add green chile strips, return to oven: Remove the tortilla from the oven and sprinkle with the cheddar cheese, leaving about 1/2-inch from the edges. Add strips of green chiles in a star pattern if you want.\nReturn the tortilla to the oven and cook for 2 more minutes, or until all of the cheese has melted.

Stir in enough water to get a creamy, easily dip-able consistency, about 1/4 of a cup.\nThe taste of refried beans is greatly enhanced by bacon fat; we'll add a teaspoon to canned beans or a tablespoon or more to taste if we are making the beans from scratch.\nIf you don't have bacon fat, you can cook up a strip of bacon, chop it up fine and add that to the beans.\nIf you are trying to avoid pork, note that most canned refried beans are made with added lard, so check the ingredients. You can use olive oil instead, to help the consistency of the beans.\nMix in the chipotle chili powder (or Tabasco, or adobo, or regular chili powder) and cumin to taste. Note that the avocados and the sour cream will cool down the spiciness of the beans considerably, so you can afford to be a bit more spicy than you might think.\nStir in salt to taste, depending on how salted your refried beans are to begin with, and depending on how salty the tortilla chips are that you are serving with the dip.\n2 Spread on serving dish, top with cheese: Once the beans are hot and bubbly, spread them over the bottom of a warmed serving dish. Immediately add the shredded cheese so that the heat from the beans helps melt the cheese.\n(The cheese doesn't need to be completely melted, but even if it is just a little, it will help the dip stay on the chip.)\n3 Layer on toppings: Layer on the chopped green chilies, chopped avocado, chopped tomato. Spoon on the sour cream (or crema Mexicana, crema fresca, or even cream fraiche).\nTop with sliced green onions and olives.\nServe immediately with tortilla chips.\nHello!

Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry if the dough has not formed completely yet.\n2 Knead the dough: Using your hands, knead all the bits of dough together inside the bowl. If your dough is still very dry, add a splash of hot water, about 1 to 2 tablespoons, until it comes together and all the flour is absorbed.\nContinue kneading the dough for about 2 more minutes. The dough will feel moist but it should not stick to your hands too much.\n3 Rest the dough: Shape the dough into a round ball. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.\n4 Roll out the pancakes: Sprinkle flour on top of a work surface. Divide the dough into 4 pieces of equal size. Work with one piece at a time, leaving the remaining pieces in the bowl.\nShape piece of dough into a small ball. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a thin circle, about 7 to 8 inches in diameter.\n5 Add the scallions: Brush a thin layer of canola oil on top of the dough, making sure not to miss the edges. Sprinkle sliced scallions all over the dough.\n6 Roll and flatten the pancake: Starting on one end, roll the circle of dough into a log. Take one end of the rolled up dough and curl it toward the center, like a snail's shell. Tuck the end of the dough underneath the spiral.\nUse the palm of your hand to flatten the dough into a thick circle. Roll it out again with your rolling pin. Try to roll it out as thinly as possible. A few slices of scallions may pop out during the process, and that\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly normal.\nTransfer rolled out scallion pancake to a plate. Repeat steps 4 through 6 with the remaining dough pieces.\n7 Cook the pancakes: Heat about 2 teaspoons of canola oil a small nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat.\nPlace one of the pancakes in the middle of the pan and pan fry each side for about 2 to 3 minutes, until they\xe2\x80\x99re golden brown. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the 3 remaining scallion pancakes, adding more oil to the pan as needed.\n8 Prepare the dipping sauce: Mix all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Adjust the seasonings to your liking, adding more soy sauce or vinegar, if you like. Add any leftover scallions to the dipping sauce, and add a pinch of red pepper flakes if you would like a bit of spice.\n9 Serve the hot pancakes: Cut the scallion pancakes into small wedges and serve while hot, with the dipping sauce. (The pancakes are still good when cooled, but will no longer be crispy.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Note that one long side of the pork loin roast will be thicker, and one side thinner.\nUsing a sharp knife, make a long cut an inch or so from the edge from the thinner long side of the roast at about a 45\xc2\xb0 degree angle, stopping a half inch from reaching the bottom of the roast.\nThen angle the knife so that it is flat, parallel to the cutting board, and make slow, shallow cuts into the roast, along the same line.\nAs you cut, you can open up the top part of the roast like a book. Keep making slow, even cuts until you have "rolled" the roast out completely.\n3 Pound the butterflied roast to an even thickness: With the pork roast unfolded, cover with 2 layers of of plastic wrap.\nPound with a meat mallet to flatten to a somewhat even thickness. Remove plastic wrap. Sprinkle the pork with salt and pepper and set aside.\n4 Make the filling: Place the panko and stock in a small bowl and stir to combine.\nStir in the apples, walnuts, cranberries, shallots, maple syrup and rosemary.\n5 Roll up pork roast with filling: Spread the filling over surface of the pork, leaving an inch margin around all sides except for the fat layer side\xe2\x80\x94with that side leave a 2-inch margin.\nStarting with the end of the roast rectangle that does not have the fat layer on the bottom, roll up the roast.\n6 Secure with kitchen string. Tie the roast in 1 to 2 inch intervals with cotton kitchen string.\nAt this point you can wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate if you are making ahead.\n7 Bake: Coat the bottom of a roasting pan with cooking spray or a little olive oil. Place the roast in the pan and cook at 450\xc2\xb0F for 15 minutes to brown the top, then reduce the oven temperature to 325\xc2\xb0F. Cook uncovered, for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 140\xc2\xb0F.\n8 Rest and serve: Tent the roast with foil and let it rest for 10 minutes. Remove the kitchen string and slice into 1/2-inch thick slices to serve.\nSave the pan drippings! Serve with pan drippings or use the pan drippings to make gravy. See How to Make Gravy.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHomemade Apple Pie Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hour, 15 minutesCook time: 55 minutesYield: Serves 8\nIf the crust looks like it's getting too browned, take a large piece of aluminum foil and place on top of the pie in the oven. No need to wrap it around the pie, just place it on top. That will keep the top from browning further.\nPies always seem to take longer to cook than one expects. (Perhaps it's because we're always opening the oven to check on how the pie is doing?) The filling should be visibly bubbling, which you should be able to see through the steam vents.\nI recommend putting a rimmed baking sheet on a rack beneath the rack of the pie to catch the filling as some of it invariably bubbles up and out over the pie. Makes oven clean-up a lot easier.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 pounds good cooking apples such as Granny Smith, Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Fuji, or Braeburn (about 6 to 8 apples, depending on the size of your apples and the size of your pie dish)\n1 tablespoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (to toss with the sliced apples so they don't brown as you slice them)\n1/2 cup to 2/3 cup sugar, depending on how sweet you like your pie\n3 tablespoons all-purpose flour for thickening\n1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1 tablespoon brandy (Optional. By the way, if you have Calvados apple brandy, use it!)\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 recipe double crust sour cream pie dough, OR all-butter crust, OR your favorite pie crust recipe\nFor the egg wash:\n1 large egg yolk\n1 tablespoon cream\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Peel, core, and slice the apples: Peel, core and slice or roughly chop the apples into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices or chunks.\nAs you cut your apple slices, add them to a large bowl and sprinkle them with a little lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to help keep them from turning brown.\n2 Make the apple pie filling: Combine sugar, flour and spices (allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon) in a bowl. Add the flour mixture to the apple slices and use your hands to distribute the flour through the apples so they are well coated.\nThen sprinkle with brandy and vanilla extract and stir to coat all the apples.\n3 Prepare oven: Place one oven rack in the lowest position and put a large rimmed baking sheet on it (to catch any drippings from the pie.) Position a second rack the next rung up (still in the lower third of the oven) and preheat to 375\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Roll out the dough and line bottom pie plate: Remove one disk of pie dough from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. Place disk on a lightly floured, clean, flat surface. Using a rolling pin, roll out the pie dough to a 12-inch circle, about 1/8 of an inch thick.\nAs you roll out the dough, check to make sure it isn't sticking. If and when it starts to stick, gently lift it up and sprinkle a little more flour on the table surface or on the pie dough to keep the dough from sticking.\nGently place the rolled out dough onto a 9-inch pie plate. Press down to line the pie dish with the dough.\n5 Place apple slices on top of the bottom crust: Arrange the apple slices in the dough-lined pie plate. Mound the apples in the center.\n6 Roll out top crust, place over apples, trim and crimp edges: Roll out the second disk of dough, again to 12-inches. Gently place the second round of pie dough over the apples. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang from the edges of the pie pan.\nFold the dough under itself so that the edge of the fold comes right to the edge of the pan. Press the top and bottom dough rounds together as you flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork.\n7 Brush with egg wash, cut vents: Place egg yolk and cream in a small bowl and use a fork to stir until well combined. Use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash over the top and fluted edges of the pie. Use a sharp knife to cut slits in the top of the pie crust for steam vents.\n8 Bake: Place pie on oven rack centered over the baking sheet on the rack below it to catch any drippings. Bake the pie at 375\xc2\xb0F until crust begins to lightly brown, about 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350\xc2\xb0F.\nBake until crust is golden and juices are bubbling, anywhere from an additional 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the type of apples you are using. (About halfway through baking check to make sure the pie isn't browning too much. When it's nicely browned, tent the pie with a large piece of aluminum foil to keep the pie from browning further.)\n9 Let cool: Transfer the apple pie to a rack to cool for at least 1 hour. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. Great with a side of vanilla ice cream.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Dot with butter.\n6 Roll out top crust, place over apples, trim and crimp edges: Roll out second disk of dough, as before. Gently turn over onto the top of the apples in the pie. Pinch top and bottom of dough rounds firmly together. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang.\nFold the dough under itself so that the edge of the fold is flush with the edge of the pan. Flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork.\n7 Score the top, brush with egg wash: Score the top of the pie with four 2-inch long cuts, so that steam from the cooking pie can escape. Beat egg yolk with cream and brush on the surface of the pie with a pastry brush.\n7 Bake: Set pie on preheated baking sheet (to catch any juices that may escape from the pie while cooking). Bake at 425\xc2\xb0F for 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 375\xc2\xb0F and cook for an additional 50 to 60 minutes or more, until filling bubbles in the center and crust turns golden brown.\n8 Cool: Cool on a wire rack for 1 1/2 hours.

b"Save It Print\nSlow Cooker Cider Pulled Pork Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 25 minutesSlow cooker time: 8 hoursYield: 10 to 12 servings\nThe meat will release liquid as it cooks. A 6-quart slow cooker for 6 pounds of meat works well. If you want to double the recipe, it's best to borrow a neighbor's slow cooker so you can have two going at once.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99d like, the pork can be served as soon as it finishes slow-cooking. Remove the pork from the liquid and transfer the liquid to a measuring cup. Shred the pork and then keep it warm in the slow cooker or on a covered baking sheet in a low oven. Use 2 cups of the cooking liquid to make the sauce. Serve immediately.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the rub:\n2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed\n2 1/2 tablespoons Kosher salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice (or 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, and a dash of nutmeg)\n1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder\n1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper\n1 teaspoon ground dry mustard\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\nFor the pork:\n6 pound boneless pork shoulder, trimmed of excess fat\n1 (12-ounce) bottle hard apple cider\n2 cups apple cider\nFor the sauce:\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n3 garlic cloves\n3/4 cup ketchup\n1/2 cup brown mustard\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n1/4 cup apple cider vinegar\n1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce\n2 teaspoons liquid smoke\n3/4 teaspoon Kosher salt\n2 cups pork stock leftover from braising\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart slow cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the rub and prep the pork: In a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the rub. Trim your pork shoulder of excess exterior fat. Massage the rub into the meat.\n2 Slow cook the pork: Place the pork in a 6-quart slow cooker. Pour in both ciders. The liquid should come about 3/4 of the way up the side of the meat; the meat should not be completely submerged.\nCover with the lid, and set slow cooker to low heat for at least 8 hours.\n3 Cool the pork and refrigerate overnight: Let the pork with the cooking liquid cool completely while still in the slow cooker insert on the counter. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and pour the cooking liquid into a separate storage container.\nTransfer the pork back to the slow cooker insert and cover. Refrigerate the pork and the cooking liquid overnight or up to three days. (Refrigerating the pork whole, rather than shredded, helps keep it moist and prevents it from drying out too much until you're ready to serve.)\n4 Shred the pork: When ready to serve the pork, remove it and the cooking liquid from the refrigerator. Scrape any solidified fat from the outside of the pork and the surface of the cooking liquid.\nUsing your fingers or two forks, shred the pork. You can do this right in the slow cooker, on a sheet pan, or on a cutting board. Pick out and discard any large pieces of fat as you go.\n5 Warm the pork: Warm the shredded pork in the slow cooker on the Low or Warm setting while you prepare the sauce. If the pork seems dry at any point, stir in a few tablespoons of the leftover cooking liquid.\nAlternatively, you can warm the pork on a sheet pan covered with foil in a low oven.\n6 Make the sauce: Measure out two cups of the leftover cooking liquid. The remainder can be strained and saved for another purpose, or frozen for up to three months.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the tomato paste and garlic. Whisk together and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant. Whisk in the remaining ingredients, finishing with the reserved 2 cups of cooking liquid.\nIncrease heat to medium high and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the sauce, whisking occasionally until it has the viscosity of thick tomato soup, but not as thick as ketchup, about 15 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning as you wish.\n7 Serve the pork: Reserve about 1/2 cup of sauce to serve in a small bowl alongside the pork. Pour the rest of the sauce over the pork, toss to combine, and serve it to the masses.\nPlace a pile of pork on top of buttered, toasted buns, top with pickles, pickled onions, or extra sauce, and dig in.\nHello!

You will let the donut holes dry here after you\xe2\x80\x99ve dipped them in the glaze.\n2 Make the batter: In a large mixing bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.\nIn medium bowl, whisk together the egg, sour cream, and apple cider.\nAdd the wet mixture to the dry mixture, followed by the melted butter, and fold to combine until you get a very thick batter.\n3 Prepare to fry the donut holes: Heat the oil in a 3-quart saucepan until the temperature reads 350\xc2\xb0F. Use a medium cookie scoop (about 1 1/2 tablespoons), to scoop up the batter. Fry the donut holes in batches, cooking each side for about 2 minutes, until the donut holes float to the surface and turn golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Repeat until all the batter is used up.\n4 Make the glaze: In a medium bowl whisk the powdered sugar with 2 tablespoons of apple cider and pinch of salt, adding more cider a few teaspoons at a time, until you get a thick, heavy glaze. You may not need all 4 tablespoons of cider. Remember that the glaze will thin as it hits the hot warm donuts.\n5 Dip the donut holes: Pour the glaze into a deep bowl or mug, this will help with glazing the donuts. Dip the warm (or even hot) donuts into the glaze, using a spoon to coat the donut hole completely.\nLift the donut hole from the glaze using a fork. Let the glaze set and drain by placing the dipped donut holes on the wire rack set over a baking sheet. Enjoy immediately!\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nApple Cider Chicken Thighs Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 50 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n4 or 5 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)\n2 medium sweet potatoes, diced (about 2 cups diced)\n1/2 white onion, sliced thin\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n1 cup apple cider\n1/2 cup chicken stock\n1 tablespoon fresh rosemary\nCooked rice or orzo for serving (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\nLarge cast iron skillet\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 350\xcb\x9aF.\n2 Sear the chicken thighs: Season the chicken thighs on both sides with kosher salt and pepper. Add chicken thighs skin-side down to a large, cold cast iron skillet. Place the skillet over medium heat and let the thighs cook, untouched, for 15 minutes, until the skin is deeply golden and crispy.\n3 Add the remaining ingredients: After the chicken thighs have cooked for 15 minutes, carefully flip them. Add the sweet potatoes, onion, apple cider, chicken stock, and fresh rosemary to the skillet. Stir gently to make sure ingredients are distributed evenly. The thighs should only be submerged halfway in the liquid so the skin stays crispy while baking.\n4 Cook the chicken thighs in the oven: Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook for 30-35 minutes, or until sweet potatoes are fork-tender and the chicken is cooked through. (It should reach at least 165\xcb\x9aF in the thickest part.) It\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to overcook chicken thighs in this environment, so don\xe2\x80\x99t worry if they register much hotter than that.\n5 Serve the chicken thighs: Divide the chicken thighs between four plates and add cooked rice or orzo to the side, which is great for soaking up the juices. Spoon sweet potatoes and onions on top.\nLeftovers will keep in the fridge for 4-5 days. To reheat, microwave the thighs for about 90 seconds on high. To regain some of the crispiness, reheat the thighs in the oven until warmed through.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nHomemade Apple Pie Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hour, 15 minutesCook time: 55 minutesYield: Serves 8\nIf the crust looks like it's getting too browned, take a large piece of aluminum foil and place on top of the pie in the oven. No need to wrap it around the pie, just place it on top. That will keep the top from browning further.\nPies always seem to take longer to cook than one expects. (Perhaps it's because we're always opening the oven to check on how the pie is doing?) The filling should be visibly bubbling, which you should be able to see through the steam vents.\nI recommend putting a rimmed baking sheet on a rack beneath the rack of the pie to catch the filling as some of it invariably bubbles up and out over the pie. Makes oven clean-up a lot easier.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 pounds good cooking apples such as Granny Smith, Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Fuji, or Braeburn (about 6 to 8 apples, depending on the size of your apples and the size of your pie dish)\n1 tablespoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (to toss with the sliced apples so they don't brown as you slice them)\n1/2 cup to 2/3 cup sugar, depending on how sweet you like your pie\n3 tablespoons all-purpose flour for thickening\n1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1 tablespoon brandy (Optional. By the way, if you have Calvados apple brandy, use it!)\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 recipe double crust sour cream pie dough, OR all-butter crust, OR your favorite pie crust recipe\nFor the egg wash:\n1 large egg yolk\n1 tablespoon cream\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Peel, core, and slice the apples: Peel, core and slice or roughly chop the apples into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices or chunks.\nAs you cut your apple slices, add them to a large bowl and sprinkle them with a little lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to help keep them from turning brown.\n2 Make the apple pie filling: Combine sugar, flour and spices (allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon) in a bowl. Add the flour mixture to the apple slices and use your hands to distribute the flour through the apples so they are well coated.\nThen sprinkle with brandy and vanilla extract and stir to coat all the apples.\n3 Prepare oven: Place one oven rack in the lowest position and put a large rimmed baking sheet on it (to catch any drippings from the pie.) Position a second rack the next rung up (still in the lower third of the oven) and preheat to 375\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Roll out the dough and line bottom pie plate: Remove one disk of pie dough from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. Place disk on a lightly floured, clean, flat surface. Using a rolling pin, roll out the pie dough to a 12-inch circle, about 1/8 of an inch thick.\nAs you roll out the dough, check to make sure it isn't sticking. If and when it starts to stick, gently lift it up and sprinkle a little more flour on the table surface or on the pie dough to keep the dough from sticking.\nGently place the rolled out dough onto a 9-inch pie plate. Press down to line the pie dish with the dough.\n5 Place apple slices on top of the bottom crust: Arrange the apple slices in the dough-lined pie plate. Mound the apples in the center.\n6 Roll out top crust, place over apples, trim and crimp edges: Roll out the second disk of dough, again to 12-inches. Gently place the second round of pie dough over the apples. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang from the edges of the pie pan.\nFold the dough under itself so that the edge of the fold comes right to the edge of the pan. Press the top and bottom dough rounds together as you flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork.\n7 Brush with egg wash, cut vents: Place egg yolk and cream in a small bowl and use a fork to stir until well combined. Use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash over the top and fluted edges of the pie. Use a sharp knife to cut slits in the top of the pie crust for steam vents.\n8 Bake: Place pie on oven rack centered over the baking sheet on the rack below it to catch any drippings. Bake the pie at 375\xc2\xb0F until crust begins to lightly brown, about 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350\xc2\xb0F.\nBake until crust is golden and juices are bubbling, anywhere from an additional 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the type of apples you are using. (About halfway through baking check to make sure the pie isn't browning too much. When it's nicely browned, tent the pie with a large piece of aluminum foil to keep the pie from browning further.)\n9 Let cool: Transfer the apple pie to a rack to cool for at least 1 hour. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. Great with a side of vanilla ice cream.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Chill until needed in the recipe.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the streusel topping: Place the streusel topping ingredients in a medium bowl and mix with a fork or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\nChill in the refrigerator until the topping is needed half-way through the baking.\n2 Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F with a rack in the middle and another rack below it. Place a large rimmed baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any of the drippings from the pie.\n3 Mix sour cream with sugar, flour, salt, vanilla, egg, and coat apple slices with it: In a large bowl put the sour cream, sugar, flour, salt, vanilla, and egg. Use a wooden spoon and beat by hand until smooth. Fold in the apples and stir until all of the apples are coated with the sour cream filling mixture.\n4 Put the filling into a frozen pie shell. For the first stage of baking, bake the pie for 25 minutes at 400\xc2\xb0F.\n5 After the first 25 minutes, remove the pie from the oven and sprinkle the top with the brown sugar butter flour topping mixture.

b"Save It Print\nGluten-Free Apple Tart Recipe\nPrep time: 45 minutesCook time: 45 minutesChill time: 1 hourYield: 8 to 10\nMaple sugar is a granulated sugar made from dehydrated maple syrup. You can find it on Amazon or in many Whole Foods Stores. Coconut sugar is becoming more widely available. It is a fine substitute, but it will make the tart a much darker shade of golden than the maple sugar.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the paleo pie crust:\n2 cups finely ground almond flour (I used Bob\xe2\x80\x99s Red Mill Superfine Almond Flour)\n1 cup arrowroot starch\n2 tablespoons maple sugar (or 3 tablespoons coconut sugar)\n1 1/2 tablespoons ground chia seeds (I used white chia seeds)\n1/2 tablespoon ground flax (I used golden flax seeds)\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, ghee, lard, duck fat, refined coconut oil, or sustainable palm shortening\n1 large egg\n1 egg yolk\n3 to 6 tablespoons ice water\nExtra arrowroot or tapioca starch for shaping and rolling\nFor the apple filling:\n6 medium baking apples (I like a mix of Granny Smiths and Honeycrisp)\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, ghee, refined coconut oil, or palm shortening\n2 tablespoons maple sugar (or three tablespoons coconut sugar)\n2 tablespoons lemon juice\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)\nZest of one lemon\nSpecial equipment:\nFood processor\n9-inch tart pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the pie crust: Combine the almond flour, arrowroot, maple sugar, chia, flax, baking powder, and salt to the bowl of a food processor and pulse 5 to 6 times to combine. Add the butter and pulse another 4 to 5 times until the mixture starts to look like sandy, pea-sized gravel. Add the egg and egg yolk, then sprinkle 3 tablespoons water evenly over the top of the dough. Pulse a few times until the mixture just starts to clump together and form a ball.\n2 Chill the crust: Turn the pastry dough out onto a cutting board and use your hands to shape it into a chubby disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least one hour or up to three days.\n3 Roll out the crust: When ready to bake the tart, lay a sheet of parchment on your counter or other flat surface and sprinkle with arrowroot or tapioca starch. Place the chilled pie dough in the center of the parchment and roll into a circle about 12 inches in diameter.\n4 Transfer the crust to the tart pan: Flip your tart pan upside down and place it in the center of the rolled out pastry dough. There should be at least 1 1/2 inches of pie dough showing around the edge. Carefully, slide one hand palm side up under the parchment and place the other hand on the tart pan. Quickly, and with great confidence, flip the whole thing over.\nGently ease the crust into the tart dish and press it into the corners. Peel back the parchment and discard. Your pastry dough may break, but just press the cracks back together if it does. Use a paring knife to trim away the excess dough and then prick the bottom of the tart all over with the tines of a fork.\n5 Place the tart shell in the freezer to chill while you prepare the apples.\n6 Preheat oven to 350F.\n7 Prepare the apples. Peel the apples and halve them lengthwise. Use a melon baller, paring knife, or small spoon to remove the core, seeds, and stem. Slice the apples very thinly (ideally 1/8-inch thick) using a chef's knife or mandoline.\n8 Prepare the glaze: In a small saucepan, melt butter (or other fat) with the sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla over medium heat. Whisk to combine while bringing to a simmer. Keep whisking until all sugar is dissolved.\n9 Assemble the tart: Find a few of your thinnest apple slices and set them aside. Remove the tart shell from the freezer and begin laying the apple slices in concentric circles, starting from the outer edge of the crust and spiraling inward.\nWhen you get to the center, take your thinnest apple slices and fold them gently to form the center of the pattern. (You might have some apple slices leftover.)\nSprinkle the lemon zest evenly over the tart. Drizzle about half of the glaze evenly over the tart. (I dipped a pastry brush in the glaze and let it drip onto onto the apples.)\n10 Bake the tart for 40 minutes, turning the pan halfway through baking.\n11 Brush the rest of the glaze over the apple slices. Return to the oven and bake for 5 more minutes.\n12 Serve warm or at room temperature.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nNew England Apple Cheddar Galette Recipe\nPrep time: 40 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: Makes 8 servings\nIf using a tart apple such as a Granny Smith, you may want to add a little sugar or more maple syrup to the filling to balance the tartness of the apple.\nINGREDIENTS\nCrust:\n1 1/2 cups (200g) of all purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons sugar\n1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cups, 6 ounces, 170 g) unsalted butter\n1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp (85 ml) sour cream (full fat, not light)\n2 Tbsp finely grated sharp cheddar cheese\nFilling:\n4 good cooking apples, such as McIntosh, Courtland, Jonagold, Pippin, Golden Delicious, Jonathan, Fuji, or a mixture of various cooking apples (NOT red delicious)\n1/2 teaspoon lemon zest\n1 half of a lemon, or the juice of half a lemon (to acidulate the water for holding the apples while you peel them to keep them from discoloring)\n1 Tbsp maple syrup\n2 teaspoons minute tapioca or instant tapioca for thickener (can substitute corn starch)\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/2 cup lightly packed grated cheddar cheese\nFinishing:\n1 egg for egg wash\nCoarse sugar for sprinkling on the crust\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nMake the pastry dough\n1 Cut the butter into cubes. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar. Sprinkle the butter cubes over the flour.\n2 Use your clean hands to squish the flour and butter together, breaking up the butter into smaller pieces until the mixture resembles a rather shaggy coarse meal with a few pea-sized pieces of butter. Add the sour cream and a couple tablespoons of finely grated sharp cheddar cheese and stir with a fork until incorporated.\n3 Gather the mixture with your hands and form a ball. Shape the ball into a disk. Sprinkle with a little flour, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to a day ahead.\n  Prepare the galette\n1 Peel, core, quarter the apples, place in water with lemon juice: Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C). Prepare a large bowl half filled with water. Squeeze into it the juice of half a lemon (and put the squeezed lemon in too if you want). Peel, quarter, and core the apples, and place into the acidulated water while you work to keep the apples from discoloring.\n2 Slice the apple quarters: Remove the apple quarters from the water. Slice each apple quarter into 4 or 5 slices, lengthwise, about 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch thick at the widest end. Return the apple slices to the acidulated water.\n3 Drain apple slices, sprinkle with maple syrup, cinnamon, minute tapioca, zest: Drain the apple slices. Place the apple slices back in the now empty bowl. Sprinkle with maple syrup and cinnamon and gently toss so that the apple slices are lightly coated with both. Add the minute tapioca and the lemon zest. Gently toss again.\n4 Roll out the dough, transfer to lined baking sheet: On a clean, lightly floured, flat surface, place the disk of dough. Roll out with a rolling pin to an even thickness and about 14 inches wide. Gently move the rolled out pastry dough to a parchment lined baking sheet.\n5 Arrange apple slices on the dough: Starting from 2 inches from the perimeter of the pastry round, arrange the apple slices, side by side, in a circular pattern, filling the circle. It's okay if some of the apple slices overlap a little.\n6 Sprinkle with cheese, fold edges over in pleats: Sprinkle the top of the apples with grated cheddar cheese. Gently fold the dough up over the apple slices, forming pleats with the dough every few inches.\n7 Brush with egg wash, sprinkle with coarse sugar: Place an egg in a small bowl with a teaspoon of water, beat with a fork or whisk until smooth. Use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash over the exposed border of the dough (don't put on the apples, just the dough). Sprinkle the egg washed crust with coarse sugar.\n8 Bake: Bake for 10 to 15 minutes (until beginning to brown) at 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C). Then lower the temperature to 375\xc2\xb0F (190\xc2\xb0C) and bake for 15 to 20 minutes more, until the apples are cooked through and the crust is nicely browned.\nCool until just lightly warm before serving.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHow to Make Fruit Leather\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 9 hoursYield: 4 cups of fruit yield about one baking sheet of fruit leather.\nINGREDIENTS\nFresh fruit (apricots, peaches, plums, berries, apples, pears, grapes)\nWater\nLemon juice\nSugar (if needed)\nSpices such as cinnamon and nutmeg (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Rinse, taste, and prep the fruit: Rinse the fruit. If you working with stone fruit, take out the pits, chop the fruit. If working with apples or pears, peel and core them, then chop. If working with grapes, de-stem them.\nTaste the fruit before proceeding. Note how sweet the fruit is. If very sweet (ripe Concord grapes for example) you will not need to add any sugar. If still a little tart, you may need to add some sugar in the next step.\n2 Cook fruit with water, sugar, lemon juice, spices: Place fruit in a large saucepan. Add a half cup of water for every 4 cups of chopped fruit.\nBring to a simmer, cover and let cook on a low heat for 10-15 minutes, or until the fruit is cooked through. Uncover and stir.\nUse a potato masher to mash up the fruit in the pan.\nTaste the fruit and determine what and how much sugar, lemon juice, or spices to add.\nAdd sugar in small amounts (1 Tbsp at a time if working with 4 cups of fruit), to desired level of sweetness.\nAdd lemon juice one teaspoon at a time to help brighten the flavor of the fruit. Add a pinch or two of cinnamon, nutmeg, or other spices to augment the flavor.\nContinue to simmer and stir until any added sugar is completely dissolved and the fruit pur\xc3\xa9e has thickened, another 5 or 10 minutes (or more).\nNote if you are working with grapes - strain the juice out of the mashed grapes to make grape juice. Force what is left behind, after straining, through a food mill, to make the pur\xc3\xa9e for the next step.\n3 Pur\xc3\xa9e the cooked, mashed fruit: Put the pur\xc3\xa9e through a food mill or chinoise. Alternatively pur\xc3\xa9e it thoroughly in a blender or food processor.\nTaste again and adjust sugar/lemon/spices if necessary. The pur\xc3\xa9e should be very smooth.\n4 Pour pur\xc3\xa9e into lined baking sheet: Line a rimmed baking sheet with sturdy plastic wrap (the kind that is microwave safe). Pour out the pur\xc3\xa9e into the lined baking sheet to about an 1/8 to 1/4 inch thickness.\n5 Slowly dry out in oven at a very low temp: Place the baking sheet in the oven, try to keep any plastic wrap from touch the sides of the oven or the oven racks. Also try to make sure that the plastic wrap hasn't folded back over on top of the pur\xc3\xa9e. If this happens, the pur\xc3\xa9e won't dry out.\nHeat the oven to a low 140\xc2\xb0F. If you have a convection setting, use it, it will speed up the process and help dry out the pur\xc3\xa9e. Let dry in the oven like this for as long as it takes for the pur\xc3\xa9e to dry out and form fruit leather.\nWe usually keep it in the oven overnight, so about 8-12 hours. The fruit leather is ready when it is no longer sticky, but has a smooth surface.\nAlternatives to the oven. If you have a food dehydrator, this would be a great use of it. My mother suggested putting the tray in the weber grill, and leaving covered, in the sun all day. Sounds like a good trick, but I haven't tried it yet.\nMy parents remember the traditional way of making fruit leather was just to tent the tray with some cheesecloth and leave it outside in the sun on a hot day.\n6 Roll up in its plastic wrap to store: When the fruit leather is ready, you can easily peel it up from the plastic wrap.\nTo store it, roll it in its plastic wrap, put it in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator or freezer.\nHello!

Cooking raw couscous is a much more involved process, which we do not cover here in this recipe.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/2 cup chopped red onion\n1/4 cup lemon juice\n1 10-ounce box of couscous, about 1 1/3 cups\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided\n1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste\n1/2 cup shelled raw pistachios*\n10 dried apricots, chopped\n1/3 cup chopped parsley\nOptional 2 teaspoons harissa, prepared or homemade (see this Paula Wolfert harissa recipe)\n*If you only have access to shelled roasted pistachios, use them and skip step 2 in the method instructions.\nMETHOD\n1 Soak chopped onion in lemon juice: Place the chopped onion in a small bowl. Pour the lemon juice over the onions, set aside and let the onions soak in the lemon juice.\n2 Toast pistachios: Toast the pistachios in a small pan on medium-high heat until lightly browned and fragrant. (Take care when toasting nuts, they can burn quickly if you don't pay attention!) Remove from heat and place into a small bowl to cool.\n3 Cook the couscous: Put 2 cups of water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add one tablespoon of olive oil and one teaspoon of salt to the water. Once the salt dissolves, stir in the couscous, turn off the heat and cover the pot. Move the pot off the hot burner and let the couscous steam, covered, for 5-6 minutes.\n4 Combine ingredients to make salad: Scoop out the couscous into a large bowl and fluff with a fork. Stir in the harissa, if using. Stir in the pistachios, chopped apricots and parsley. Stir in the red onion and lemon juice. Add one more tablespoon of olive oil, stir well and add salt to taste.

b'Print\nRosemary Duck with Apricots Recipe\nPrep time: 2 hoursCook time: 10 minutesYield: Serves 4\nThis recipe will work with either domestic or wild ducks.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 Tbsp chopped fresh rosemary\n2 Tbsp brown sugar\n1 Tbsp freshly ground black pepper\n2 teaspoons salt\n2 whole duck breasts, halved\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 cup champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar\n4 apricots, quartered\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Marinate the duck breasts: Combine the rosemary, brown sugar, black pepper, and salt. Rub the mixture over the duck breasts. Cover and chill 2 hours. Rinse duck with cold water, pat dry.\n2 Score the fatty skin with a sharp knife: If the duck breasts are very fatty, score the skin side with a sharp knife. Be careful not to cut the meat.\n3 Cook fat side down, starting with a cold pan: Lay the duck breast halves skin side down in a cold saut\xc3\xa9 pan and turn on the heat to medium-high. (Yes, start with a cold pan.) Once you hear the duck breasts sizzle, turn the heat down to medium and allow to cook undisturbed until the skin is brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes.\n4 Turn breasts over to finish cooking: Turn the duck breast over and cook another 2-3 minutes, depending on how well done you like your duck. Use the finger test to check for doneness. As a final step, tip the duck breasts on their sides \xe2\x80\x94 thick side down \xe2\x80\x94 and let them sizzle another minute or so. Remove to a cutting board to rest.\n5 Caramelize the apricots: While the duck is cooking, combine the granulated sugar and vinegar in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook until thick and amber-colored (about 5 minutes).\nAdd apricots; reduce heat, and cook for 1 minute or until the apricots begin to soften.\n6 Serve: To serve, cut duck diagonally across the grain into slices. Serve with caramelized apricots.\nVARIATION WITH WHOLE DUCK INSTEAD OF BREASTS:\nYou can instead roast a whole duck. Here are the steps (also from Keith):\n1 Marinate the duck: Rinse off the duck, outside and inside, pat dry. Remove any remaining feathers.\nPrick the skin all over with a sharp-tined fork, taking care not to prick the meat.\nRub the duck all over with a little bit of olive oil. Rub the rosemary mixture all over the duck and some in the cavity.\nTie the legs together loosely. Put in a plastic bag and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.\n2 Roast the duck breast side up: At least a half an hour before you plan to cook the duck, remove from the refrigerator so it can get to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Place the duck on a roasting rack in a roasting pan, breast side up. Pour a cup of water into the pan. Roast for 45 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and pour off the fat and water. Separate the fat to use for basting.\n3 Finish roasting the duck breast side down: Turn the bird on the rack so now the breast is facing down. Baste the bird with the fat. Return the bird to the oven. Increase the temperature to 400\xc2\xb0F. Estimate a total cooking time of 15 minutes per lb of bird. So if you have a 4 lb duck, cook it another 30 minutes.\nThe bird is done when the juices run clear from a thigh pricked all the way down to the joint and when a meat thermometer inserted in the inner thigh below the leg joint reads 175 to 180 degrees. Be careful not to overcook the duck. When the bird is done, transfer it to a platter and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

This recipe can be easily doubled; if doubling, use an 8-quart pot.\nINGREDIENTS\n5 cups of chopped apricots, pits discarded*\n2 + 3/4 cups of sugar\n1/3 cup of Riesling (or Gew\xc3\xbcrztraminer)\n5 tablespoons of lemon juice\nMETHOD\n1 Place a couple small plates in the freezer, these will be used to test the jam later.\n2 Bring apricots, sugar, wine, lemon juice to a boil: Place the apricots, sugar, wine, and lemon juice in a large (at least 4-qt), thick-bottomed, stainless steel pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.\n3 Skim the foam, gently stir: The mixture will boil and rise in volume. Skim off the pale yellow foam that forms at the top and discard. The boil will subside to larger bubbles, but still bubble vigorously. Be sure to begin gently stirring the jam frequently to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.\n4 Test jam on cold plate: After about 25 minutes begin testing the jam by placing a small amount on a cold plate. Allow 30 seconds to pass and then run your finger through it to see what the cooled consistency will be. Boil for a few minutes longer if desired for a thicker jam.\n5 Ladle into jars: Ladle into hot, sterilized canning jars** and seal leaving 1/4 inch of head space. Before applying the lids, sterilize the lids by placing them in a bowl and pouring boiling water over them. Wipe the rims of the jars clean before applying the lids.\nWill keep for up to a year.\n* If you want, you can use a few of the kernels from the pits to give your jam a slight almond-y flavor. Roast the pits at 350 for about 10 minutes. Take them and crack them open with a hammer (do outside on concrete), and extract the kernel. Roast the "nuts" for a couple of minutes. Pop one or two in each sterilized jar when you pour the jam in.\n** To sterilize the jars, rinse out clean Mason jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, upright in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 minutes.\nHello!

Work the butter with your fingers to smear it and crumble it into the flour, until the mixture resembles a coarse cornmeal.\nTip: at this point, if you briefly heat the apricot berry mixture in the microwave or oven, until it is warm, it will help the biscuit topping to rise.\n3 Add almond extract and buttermilk: Add almond extract to the buttermilk, then form a well in the middle of the flour mixture and pour in the buttermilk.\nGently mix (with wooden spoon or your hands) until the dough just comes together. Do not over-mix.\n4 Form "cobblestone" shapes of the dough and arrange on the top of the apricot berry mixture. (You can also just crumble the dough over the top.) Sprinkle brown sugar over the top of the dough. Drizzle melted butter over the top (aim for the fruit more than the biscuits).\n5 Preheat oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. Let the cobbler sit and rise for 10-20 minutes before baking.\n6 Bake: Bake at 425\xc2\xb0F for 10-15 minutes or until the top is just beginning to brown, then reduce the heat to 350\xc2\xb0F. Cook for an additional 30 to 40 more minutes, until the center fruit is thickened and bubbly.\nCheck during cooking, if the topping is getting too brown, cover it with foil and turn the heat down to 325\xc2\xb0F.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nApricot Hamantaschen Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hour, 30 minutesCook time: 12 minutesChill time: 12-72 hoursYield: 26-36 cookies\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the apricot filling:\n1-1/4 cups (7 ounces) dried apricots, preferably Turkish\n2 tablespoons honey\nFor the dough:\n2 cups (262 grams) all-purpose flour\n3/4 cup (156 grams) sugar\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter or margarine, chilled\n1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest\n1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest\n1 large egg, lightly beaten\nSpecial equipment:\nFood processor\nBox grater\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the filling: Put the apricots in a small saucepan and add enough water to cover. Put on the lid, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the fruit is tender, about 10-15 minutes.\nRemove the apricots from the saucepan with a slotted spoon and place in a food processor. Reserve the cooking water.\nAdd the honey and 1 tablespoon of the cooking water to the food processor, and puree until very smooth, scraping down the sides of the food processor from time to time. If the fruit is too thick for the machine to puree it, add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of cooking water.\nScrape the filling into a container, let it cool, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight or up to 3 days before baking.\n2 Make the dough: Lay a large sheet of plastic wrap on the counter.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Using the large holes of a box grater, grate the margarine or butter into the bowl (work quickly so the butter does not melt). Add the lemon and orange zest.\nWork the grated butter into the flour with a pastry cutter or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add the egg and knead with your hands for a minute or 2, until the dough is smooth and no longer crumbly.\nLay the dough on the plastic wrap, press into a flat rectangle, and wrap tightly. Chill in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 3 days.\n3 Heat the oven and prepare the baking sheets: Preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F and position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it come to temperature for 10 minutes.\n4 Roll out the dough Lightly flour your countertop. Cut the dough in half; return one half to the refrigerator.\nDust both sides of the dough lightly with flour. Roll out to an even 1/8-inch thickness. Use a dry pastry brush or your hands to brush off the excess flour. Using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter or a drinking glass, cut the dough into rounds.\nPlace the rounds on the baking sheets as you go. Once your first sheet is filled, pop it in the fridge so the cookies keep their shape while you work on the second baking sheet. Save and refrigerate the dough scraps.\nRepeat with remaining half of dough, then re-roll scraps and get as many rounds as you can out of them. (You\xe2\x80\x99ll have anywhere between 26 to 36 rounds).\n5 Fill the cookies: Transfer the chilled filling to a piping bag or a zip-top sandwich bag with the corner snipped off.\nWorking with one baking sheet at a time, pipe a circle of filling (about 1-1/2 teaspoons) on the center of each dough round. (You will likely have extra filling. Store it in the refrigerator and use it to spread on toast or stir into yogurt.)\n6 Shape the cookies: Start by folding one edge over. Fold the second edge over so one corner overlaps the other and forms a 60-degree angle. Fold the third edge over, creating the three distinct corners of a triangle. The first few cookies you shape might not be perfect, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll get the hang of it quickly. There is no need to press, pinch or seal the edges.\n7 Bake the cookies: Arrange the cookies so they are about 2 inches apart (they should all fit on two baking sheets). Bake and set your timer for 6 minutes.\nWhen the timer goes off, rotate the sheets front to back and top to bottom. Reset the timer, and bake the cookies for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Total baking time will be 12 to 16 minutes.\n8 Cool the cookies: Cool the cookies on sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer to cooling racks with a metal spatula. You may serve the cookies warm, but they are best at room temperature.\nThe cookies are crispiest on the day you bake them, but they will last up to 3 days in a tightly covered container.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nHow to Cook and Eat an Artichoke\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 35 minutes\nINGREDIENTS\n1 or more large globe artichokes\n1-2 cloves of garlic, cut in half (can leave skin on)\n1 bay leaf\n1 slice of lemon\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nHOW TO COOK AN ARTICHOKE\n1 Cut of the tips of the leaves: If the artichokes have little thorns on the ends of their leaves, take a kitchen scissors and cut off the tips. This step is mostly for aesthetics as the thorns soften with cooking and pose no threat to the person eating the artichoke. But snipping them off will make the artichokes easier to handle.\n2 Slice off the top of the artichoke: Slice about 3/4 inch to an inch off the tip of the artichoke. A serrated bread knife works great for this.\n3 Remove small leaves at the base: Pull off any smaller leaves towards the base and on the stem.\n4 Cut off excess stem: Cut off excess stem, leaving up to an inch on the artichoke. The stems can be more bitter than the rest of the artichoke, but some people like to eat them. The inner cores of the stems taste like the heart.\nAlternatively you can leave the whole long stem on the artichoke, just cut off the very end of the stem, and peel the tough outside layer of the stem with a vegetable peeler.\n5 Rinse the artichokes: Rinse the artichokes in running cold water. While you rinse them, open up the leaves a little so that the water gets inside more easily. (This is where it helps to have cut off the thorny tips, it makes the artichoke easier to open without getting poked!)\n6 Set up a pot with some water, aromatics, and a steaming basket: In a large pot, put a couple inches of water, the garlic, a slice of lemon, and a bay leaf (this adds wonderful flavor to the artichokes). Insert a steaming basket.\n7 Steam the artichokes: Place artichokes on top of the steaming basket. Cover the pot. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer.\nCook for 25 to 35 minutes or longer, until the outer leaves can easily be pulled off.\nNote: artichokes can also be cooked in a pressure cooker (about 5-15 minutes at high pressure). Cooking time depends on how large the artichokes are. The larger, the longer they take to cook.\nHOW TO EAT AN ARTICHOKE\nArtichokes may be eaten cold or hot, but I think they are much better hot. They are served with a dip, either melted butter or mayonnaise. My favorite dip is mayo with a little bit of balsamic vinegar mixed in.\n1 Pull off the leaves and dip: Pull off the outer leaves, one at a time. Dip the white fleshy end in melted butter, a vinaigrette, or sauce.\n2 Place light end in mouth, dip side down, pull, scraping through your teeth: Tightly grip the other end of the petal. Place in mouth, dip side down, and pull through teeth to remove soft, pulpy, delicious portion of the petal. (Why dip-side down? Your tongue is where most of your taste buds are, so you\'ll get a fuller flavor if you strip the leaves that way.) Discard remaining petal.\nContinue until all of the petals are removed.\nWhen you get to the tender inner leaves with the purple tips, you can remove them all at once. Dip and eat just the light colored parts of these leaves.\n3 Scrape out the choke: With a knife or spoon, scrape out and discard the inedible fuzzy part (called the "choke") covering the artichoke heart.\n4 Cut the heart into pieces and eat: Underneath the artichoke choke is the heart. Cut the heart into pieces and dip into melted butter, a vinaigrette, or a sauce to eat.\nMy favorite artichoke dipping sauce? Some mayonnaise with a little balsamic vinegar stirred in.\nHello!

Chop the centers and put into a food processor. Pulse until you have coarse breadcrumbs. You should have about 3 cups.\n2 Make the stuffing: In a large bowl, stir together the breadcrumbs, lemon zest, Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, chopped parsley, minced oregano, 1/2 cup olive oil, and black pepper. Set aside.\n3 Prep the artichokes: Cut off the stem, leaving 1/2 inch from the bottom row of leaves. Using kitchen scissors, cut off 1/2-inch of the tips of all of the artichoke leaves.\nCut 1 inch from the top of the artichoke. (It helps to use a serrated knife like a bread knife for this.)\nTake a slice of lemon and rub over the cut edges of the artichokes to keep them from turning brown.\n4 Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xb0F (190\xc2\xb0C).\n5 Stuff the artichokes: Use your finger to gently pull open the center leaves of the artichokes. Pull out the inner tender yellow artichoke leaves. Use a small metal spoon to scrape and scoop out all of the inner fuzzy choke.\nNote that removing the choke at this stage isn't entirely necessarily, and it does require some elbow grease. That said, it makes eating the stuffed artichoke a much easier, and more enjoyable experience.\nPlace artichokes on a sheet pan (to catch the breadcrumbs) and start stuffing the artichoke with your stuffing mix. Put some stuffing mix between each large leaf and the artichoke, as well as a generous amount in the center.\n6 Bake the artichokes: Put about 1-inch of boiling water in the bottom of a Dutch oven that will snugly hold the artichokes. Add 2 slices of lemon, a bay leaf, 2 cloves garlic to the water.\nPlace the artichokes sitting upright in the water. Drizzle with remaining 2 Tbsp olive oil.\nCover the pot tightly with a lid. (Remember to cover the dish or this method will not work!)\nBake for 1 hour at 375\xc2\xb0F (190\xc2\xb0C), or until a knife easily penetrates the heart of the artichoke or you can easily remove one of the outer petals. (Depending on the size of the artichoke baking time can vary from 50 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes or longer.)\nRemove the cover and broil for a minute or so, enough to get some browning on the top of the stuffing.\nRemove artichokes to a serving dish to serve.\nHello!

Microwave on high heat for 30 seconds (or heat oil and herbs on the stovetop until warm). Let the herbs steep in the warm olive oil while you prepare the artichokes.\n2 Prep the artichokes: Prepare a large pot with an inch of water at the bottom. Add the cut cloves of garlic and the bay leaf, and place a steamer rack in the pot.\nTo prepare the artichokes, have lemon wedges ready. If you want a nice presentation, use scissors to snip away the pointy tips of the artichoke leaves. As you trim the artichokes, rub the cut areas with juice from the lemon wedges to prevent the artichokes from turning brown from oxidation.\nUse a vegetable peeler to cut away the thick outer layer of the artichoke stems. Trim the stems to 2 inches from the base of the artichoke. Cut off and discard the top 1/2 inch of the artichokes. Cut the artichokes in half.\nUse a strong metal spoon to scoop out the fuzzy chokes and the small inner artichoke leaves. Rub lemon juice all over the inside and exposed cut areas of the artichokes.\n\n3 Steam the artichokes: Heat the water in the large pot with a steamer rack on high. When it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium high and place the artichoke halves, cut side down on the steam rack.\nCover. Steam for 20 minutes (less or more, depending on the size of the artichokes), until you can easily pull off the outer leaves, and you can pierce the heart easily with a knife.\nThe artichokes can be just a tiny bit less cooked than would be typically perfect for steamed artichokes, as you will be cooking them further on the grill.\n4 Grill the artichokes: Prepare your grill for direct, high heat. Use a pastry brush to brush the artichoke all over with the herb infused oil. Sprinkle all over with salt.\nPlace the artichoke halves cut-side-down on the grill grates. Cover, and grill for 5 to 10 minutes, until you have nice grill mark on the cut sides of the artichokes.\nTo serve, sprinkle the cut sides with more lemon juice. Serve alone or with mayonnaise, remoulade, or aioli.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

You can also easily use a frozen pie shell, just keep it frozen, do not defrost.\nWe use goat cheese in this recipe. You could easily sub with grated Gruyere or Monterey jack.\nINGREDIENTS\nCrust:\n1 cup all purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup (1 stick, 4 ounces, 8 Tbsp) butter\n2 to 2 1/2 Tbsp of water\nOne 9-inch pie dish\nQuiche: \n1/2 cup, packed, finely chopped artichoke hearts (cooked fresh or canned artichoke hearts packed in water)\n6 ounces cooked spinach (if using frozen, thaw first), squeezed to remove excess water (wrap in clean tea towel or several layers of paper towels and squeeze), finely chopped\n1 Tbsp butter\n1/2 cup minced shallots\n2 teaspoons grated lemon zest\n4 eggs (large)\n1 cup milk\n1/2 cup heavy whipping cream\n4 ounces goat cheese\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n2 Tbsp minced chives or green onion greens\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1a Make the dough for the quiche crust: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.\nCut the butter into cubes and use your (clean) hands to work the butter into the flour until you have a mixture that looks like a coarse meal with pieces of butter no bigger than a pea.\nSprinkle water onto the flour mixture a little at a time, and work the dough with your hands until the dough can be formed into a ball.\nFlatten the ball into a disk and wrap with plastic wrap. Chill for at least 1 hour.\n1b Roll out the dough: When you are ready to roll out the dough, remove the disk from the refrigerator and let come to room temp for 10 minutes.\nRoll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a diameter 2 inches wider than your pie or tart pan. Drape the rolled out dough over the pie or tart pan and press the dough into the sides of the pan. Trim and crimp the edges.\nPlace in freezer for 30 minutes to an hour.\n2 (Optional) Pre-bake the crust: At this point, if you want, you can "blind bake" or pre-bake the crust. Pre-baking the crust will ensure that the bottom crust is browned and won\'t get soggy. I often skip this step and find that although the bottom crust might not get browned, it\'s usually perfectly palatable.\nTo pre-bake a store-bought crust, just follow the directions on the crust package.\nTo pre-bake the homemade crust in this recipe, line the inside with aluminum foil and fill it with pie weights such as beans. The foil and the pie weights will help keep the sides of the crust from sliding down as it bakes.\nBake for 15 minutes at 375\xc2\xb0F, then remove the foil and weights, prick the bottom of the crust with the tines of a fork , and bake for another 10 minutes.

Add the sliced leeks and gently cook until softened, about 10 minutes.\n2 Add artichoke hearts, tarragon, salt: Once the leeks are cooked through and softened, add the artichoke hearts, tarragon, and salt. Cook until the artichoke hearts are warmed through, then remove from pan to a bowl and set aside.\n3 Make the egg batter: In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and the cottage cheese.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the flour, Parmesan, and baking powder.\nAdd the flour mixture to the egg mixture and whisk.\nStir the artichokes and leeks into the egg  mixture. Note that the color of the mixture may change, don't worry if this happens, it will go back to normal when cooked.\n4 Pour egg mixture into pan and gently cook: Wipe out the pan with a paper towel. Then melt another tablespoon of butter into the pan on medium heat, and swirl along the bottom and sides to coat well. Pour the egg mixture into the pan, swirling to make sure the artichokes and leeks are evenly distributed.\nLower the heat. Cover the pan, slowly cook on the stove top for 12 to 15 minutes, until all but the center has set. You'll need to check every few minutes.\nThe heat should be high enough to set the mixture, but low enough so that the edges don't brown. This frittata benefits from slow, gentle cooking.\n5 Finish in the broiler: Place rack in upper third of oven. Preheat the broiler. When the frittata is mostly set, except for the center which is still wiggly, place the pan in the oven. Broil for 3 to 4 minutes until the top is lightly browned and the center has set.\n6 Serve: Remove pan from oven. (Be careful about the hot handle! Use a pot holder. I like to run an ice cube over the handle to to be extra safe.) Use a blunt knife or a metal spatula to loosen the edges of the frittata from the pan. Gently insert the spatula under the frittata to loosen it from the bottom of the pan. Then gently slide the frittata onto a serving plate.\nGarnish with chives or parsley to serve.\nHello!

OR you can use stale bread that is no longer soft. Drying the bread in the oven will help keep it from falling apart when you add the egg mixture later.\n2 Cook the chopped bacon: Place bacon in medium skillet on medium high heat. Cook until bacon is lightly browned and much of the fat rendered. Remove bacon from pan with a slotted spoon, place on a paper towel lined plate to drain. Pour off all but enough bacon fat to coat the bottom of the pan (do not put down the drain, it will clog your pipes).\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions: Add chopped onions to the pan with bacon fat. Cook on medium high heat until lightly browned, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the bacon back to the pan with the onions, stir, remove from heat.\n4 Blanch the asparagus: While the onions are cooking, bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the asparagus and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain and shock the asparagus in ice water to stop the cooking.\n5 Mix eggs, milk, cheese: In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a fork or whisk. Whisk in the milk. Stir in the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir in the grated cheddar cheese.\n6 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n7 Place bread in egg milk mixture, fold in bacon and vegetables: Place the cubed bread in the egg milk mixture and press down with your hands so that the bread cubes absorb most of the egg milk mixture. Gently fold in the onions, bacon, asparagus, chopped artichoke hearts, and chives. (Be gentle as to not break up the bread.)\n8 Assemble the casserole: Generously butter the inside of a 2 1/2 to 3 quart (8 x 13 inch) casserole dish. Gently pour the bread egg milk vegetable mixture into the casserole dish and spread out in an even layer.\nAt this point you can make up to a day ahead.

b"Save It Print\nBraised Marinated Artichokes Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Serves 4\nChoose globe artichokes whose petals are closed. They'll be fresher than artichokes whose petals have started to open wide. Frost-kissed artichokes are especially delicious, so even though they may look a little blemished, they'll taste great.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 large globe artichokes\n1 lemon\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n3/4 cup sliced shallots\n3 cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp\n3 bay leaves\n1 cup dry white wine (such as a Sauvignon blanc)\n3/4 cup water\n1 teaspoon salt\n3 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley leaves\n2 Tbsp chopped fresh mint leaves\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the artichokes: Prepare a large bowl with cold water. Squeeze half a lemon into the water. Using a serrated knife (bread knife works well for this), cut off the top inch of the artichokes. Squeeze a little lemon over the cut areas to keep the artichokes from turning brown.\nUse kitchen shears to snip off the thorny tips of the artichoke leaves.\nUse the serrated knife to cut the artichokes into quarters.\nUse a metal teaspoon to scrape away the hairy choke above the artichoke heart. Remove the small, papery, purplish leaves close to the choke. Rub the cut areas again with lemon.\nPlace the quartered artichoke hearts into the bowl of acidulated water as you finish prepping them.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 shallots and garlic: Heat olive oil on medium heat in a thick-bottomed pot that will hold all of the artichokes tightly in a single layer. (Choose a pot with a tight-fitting lid.)\nWhen the oil is hot, add the shallots and saut\xc3\xa9 for 3 to 5 minutes, until softened.\nAdd the garlic and cook an additional minute.\n3 Add wine, water, bay leaves, salt, then simmer: Add the white wine, water, bay leaves, and salt to the pot. Make sure there is enough liquid to cover the bottom of the pan by 1/4-inch. If not, add more water until there is. Bring to a simmer, and simmer for a minute.\n4 Add quartered artichokes, simmer: Place the quartered artichokes, cut side down in a single layer, in the pot. Bring to a boil on high heat.\nCover the pot with a tight fitting lid and lower the heat to medium. Simmer for 20 minutes. (If it looks like the pot is at risk of running out of liquid, add more hot water to the pot.)\n5 Toss with parsley, mint, continue to simmer: Then toss with the parsley and mint, turning the artichokes over to coat them with the sauce, cover again, and cook for an additional 5 to 15 minutes, until the leaves are tender and are easy to pull off the artichoke.\nNote that older artichokes may take a longer cooking time (and therefore more water/wine in the pot) to get tender.\nLet cool to slightly warm or room temperature. Serve with some of the pan juices and shallots from the braising liquid. Especially good if you make a day ahead, giving the cooked artichokes more time to marinate. Just chill, and return to room temperature before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a large rectangle.\n3 Transfer the dough to the pan: Transfer the dough to the oiled sheet pan, stretching it out to the corners of the pan. If it springs back, wait a few minutes and then try again.\nDrizzle 1 tablespoon of the olive oil onto the dough. Use a pastry brush or your fingers to gently spread the oil all over the dough, taking care not to create any tears. Sprinkle the Italian seasoning evenly over the dough.\n4 Wilt the spinach: Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil and the garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. When the garlic begins to bubble, add the spinach. Saut\xc3\xa9 until the spinach has wilted, about 2 minutes, then turn off the heat.\n5 Top the pizza: If the dough has shrunk away from the corners, give it a final stretch to reach the sides of pan. Sprinkle on half of the mozzarella over the pizza, followed by the saut\xc3\xa9ed spinach and then the artichokes. Sprinkle with the rest of the mozzarella.\n6 Bake the pizza: Bake the pizza until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.\n7 Slice and serve: Use two spatulas to lift the pizza from the pan and transfer it to a large cutting board to slice into squares, or use a pizza wheel to slice it right in the pan.

b"Print\nHow to Trim an Artichoke\nYou'll need a sharp paring knife, a large empty bowl for leaves, and a large bowl filled two-thirds with ice water.\nINGREDIENTS\nArtichokes\nA fresh lemon cut in half\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Squeeze half a lemon into a large bowl of water: If you are trimming more than one artichoke, squeeze half a lemon into a large bowl of ice water. You will be dropping trimmed artichokes into this bowl to keep them from browning while you work others.\n2 Snap off outer green leaves, then pull off yellow petals: Start by snapping off the artichoke leaves and tossing them into a large empty bowl. When you get to the yellow petals, just pull them off. Wipe the exposed surface with the other half of the lemon you cut.\n3 Pull out the pink tipped leaves: Take care when you get to the pink center of the artichoke leaves. There are sharp spines on the end of the inner leaves. Pull them out.\n4 Use a paring knife to dig out the fuzzy choke. You will want to slice off the narrowest layer of the heart to get all of the choke without cutting away too much of the delicious heart.\nA note on this whole process. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it if there are distractions. You need to focus. You will be using a sharp knife close to your hands. Since artichokes are tough when raw, you can easily cut yourself if you take your eye off what you are doing.\n5 Rub cut lemon over exposed artichoke heart: Once the fuzzy choke is out, smear the cut lemon all over the exposed heart.\nThis prevents the heart from oxidizing and turning brown. An artichoke is still perfectly edible when oxidized, it just is not particularly attractive.\n6 Slice off all but the last inch or so of the stem. Rub lemon juice on the cut end.\n7 Trim the hard green exterior of the rest of the heart. Cut away from you as you rotate the artichoke, slicing off just the hard green part and leaving the light green underneath. Rub this with lemon.\n8 To finish, slice the outside layer off the stem and then coat the whole heart one more time with lemon. Drop into the lemon-water bath and go on to the next one.\nHere's a tip: as your cut lemon gets used up, put it in the water bath, which will help keep the bath\xe2\x80\x99s citric acid content high, and help keep the artichokes from browning.\nHello!

Peel and devein once thawed.\nWe are using artichokes canned in water for this recipe and we suggest including the artichoke water in with the risotto. Taste the artichoke water first. If it tastes good to you, then include. If not, then don\'t.\nYou can also use frozen or fresh cooked artichoke hearts instead of canned. For frozen you\'ll probably need about 8 ounces. For fresh, you\'ll probably need the hearts from 2 globe artichokes, cooked and finely chopped.\nSee How to Cook and Eat an Artichoke for instructions on cooking artichokes.\nINGREDIENTS\n12 ounces raw shrimp (26-30 size), about 18 pieces\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\nSalt\n1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 Tbsp butter + 2 Tbsp butter\n1/3 cup minced shallots\n1 Tbsp minced garlic\n1 1/2 cup risotto rice (recommend carnaroli, can also use arborio)\n1/2 cup dry white wine (like a Sauvignon Blanc)\n8 ounces clam juice\n1 14-ounce can artichoke hearts packed in water, drained (reserve the water!), and finely chopped\n2-3 cups water\n2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toss shrimp with paprika, salt, pepper: Pat dry the peeled and deveined shrimp and place them in a medium bowl, toss to coat with 1/2 teaspoon salt, the paprika, and pepper.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 shrimp: Heat 1 Tbsp butter in a small saut\xc3\xa9 pan on high heat.

Then remove to a bowl and set aside.\n3 Simmer salted water: Put 3 cups of water with about a teaspoon of salt in a small saucepan. Heat until simmering and keep warm while you start the risotto.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 shallots, garlic: Heat 2 Tbsp butter in a 3 to 4-quart thick-bottomed pot on medium heat. Add the minced shallots and cook until translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes.\nAdd the garlic and cook a minute more.\n5 Add risotto rice: Add the risotto rice to the pot, stir to coat. Let cook for a minute or two for the rice to just barely begin to brown.\n6 Add 1/2 cup dry white wine. Let come to a low simmer and slowly stir until the wine has been absorbed by the rice.\n7 Add clam juice, artichoke can water: Add the clam juice and the reserved water from the can of artichokes, a half cup at a time, slowly stirring and allowing the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more liquid.\n8 Start adding hot salted water, 1/2 cup at a time: Once the rice as absorbed the wine, clam juice, and artichoke water, you can start adding the hot, lightly salted water from step one.\nAdd it 1/2 cup at a time, again stirring slowly allowing the rice to absorb it for a minute or two before adding any more. You\'ll need between 2 and 3 cups of water.\nYou\'ll want to stop adding water when the rice is cooked through, but still a little firm to the bite, "al dente".\n9 Stir in the chopped artichoke hearts.

Angle the knife toward the center of the artichoke while you do this so the result is more cone-shaped.\nUse a melon baller to scoop out and discard the fuzzy choke in the center of the artichoke.\nCut the artichoke into quarters, and cut each quarter into 3 or 4 slices. Place in the acidified water.\n2 Cook artichokes with sliced onions in olive oil: Heat olive oil in a 3 to 4 quart, thick-bottomed pot on medium heat. Add the sliced onions and artichoke hearts. Toss to coat with the olive oil.\nCook on medium low to low heat for 40 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, until the artichokes are completely cooked through and tender, and the onions are caramelized.\n3 Sprinkle with salt, sugar, and vinegar and cook for a few minutes more.\nHello!

Once they are trimmed, slice lengthwise into pieces roughly \xc2\xbc inch thick. You want them to look like silhouettes of an artichoke heart.\n2 Bathe the slices in a bowl of lemon juice.\n3 Heat garlic in olive oil: Get a large, heavy pot with a lid and pour in a layer of olive oil. Add the smashed garlic cloves and turn the heat to low.\n4 Add salted artichoke heart slices to the oil: Take some artichoke heart slices out of the lemon juice and salt them well. Slip them into the olive oil in layers, adding more olive oil to cover. You will probably need about a pint or so of olive oil \xe2\x80\x93 it is very important they are completely covered.\nDo not use cheap vegetable oil (corn, canola, etc) as a substitute because you will definitely taste the olive oil in the final dish. You could use melted butter, though\xe2\x80\xa6\n5 Heat on low: Cover the pot and cook on the lowest heat of your weakest burner for 45 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the oil cool for another 20-30 minutes.\n6 Remove from oil and toss with remaining ingredients: To make the salad, just remove the artichokes from the oil and toss with the remaining ingredients. You can eat the garlic or not, but it is just there to flavor the oil.\nServe at room temperature. It keeps for several days in the fridge.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.\n3 Season the salmon fillets: Rub both sides of the fillets with 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt and a 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper.\n4 Sear the salmon: Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan (preferably nonstick). Once the oil starts to ripple in the pan, place the salmon fillets into the pan, skin-side up.\nPress the fillets down gently to make sure the entire surface makes contact with the pan. Sear the salmon fillets for 3 minutes, or until the flesh turns an opaque pink 1/4 of the way up the sides of the fillets.\n5 Flip the salmon and keep it hot: Use a spatula to flip the salmon and sear it, skin-side down, for an additional 3 minutes.\nTransfer the fillets to a sheet pan and place them in the heated oven while you finish the dish. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if the salmon is not cooked completely through just yet\xe2\x80\x94it will continue to cook in the oven.\n6 Cook the shallot and deglaze the pan: In the same pan you used to sear the salmon, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and the garlic to the pan and saut\xc3\xa9 for 3 minutes, or until glossy and fragrant.\nPour the white wine and lemon juice into the pan and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of food that have stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the lemon halves and bring the mixture to a boil.\n7 Reduce the sauce and cook the pasta: Reduce the sauce in the pan by half by maintaining a boil. This should take 3 to 4 minutes.\n8 Cook the pasta: By now, your pasta water should be at a rolling boil. Add generous tablespoon of salt to the boiling water and drop the pasta into the middle of the pot. Stir the pasta immediately to separate the noodles.\nLower the temperature slightly to prevent the water from boiling over and cook the pasta for 4 to 5 minutes, until al dente (or according to package directions). Drain the pasta.\n9 Finish the sauce:  Once the liquid in the pan has reduced by half, reduce the heat to medium-low. Remove the lemon halves. Slowly stir in the heavy cream and the remaining butter.\nAllow the sauce to come to a simmer, then add the arugula. Stir to coat the arugula in the sauce and allow it to wilt slightly\xe2\x80\x94this should only take a minute or so. Add the Parmesan, along with the remaining salt and pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary, by adding a bit more salt or pepper.\n10 Combine the pasta and sauce: Add the pasta to the pan with the sauce. Using tongs, toss in the pasta in the sauce until it is evenly coated.\n11 Serve the pasta with the salmon: Remove the warm salmon fillets from the oven and arrange on top of the pasta.

b"Save It Print\nEasy Steak Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 10 minutesYield: Serves 4\nNo need to bring the steak to room temp before cooking. You sear on such high heat, and the steaks are so thin, it's actually better to cook the steak while it is still relatively chilled, if you want the centers to be rare.\nINGREDIENTS\nExtra virgin olive oil\n1 pound flank steak or skirt steak\nSalt and freshly ground pepper\n1/2 head lettuce greens\n1 bunch arugula (young leaves), tough stems removed\n1/2 red bell pepper, thinly sliced lengthwise and cut into 1-inch long pieces\n4 scallions, thinly sliced\n1 avocado, cut into bite-sized pieces\n4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled\nPomegranate seeds or thinly sliced kumquats (optional)\nFor the dressing:\n2 tablespoons lemon juice\n6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (smooth), or 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard\nSalt and pepper\nMETHOD\n1 Cook the steak: Heat a couple teaspoons of oil in a cast iron pan on high heat. Pat the steaks dry. Sprinkle the steaks on both sides with a little salt.\nSear the steaks in the pan on both sides, just until nicely browned. Remove pan from heat and cover. Let cook for a few minutes more, until the steak is done to your liking.\nYou can test with a meat thermometer. Remove steak from pan at 125\xc2\xb0F to 130\xc2\xb0F for rare, 140\xc2\xb0F for medium rare, 150\xc2\xb0 for medium.

Let rest for a few minutes before cutting. Cut thin slices, on a diagonal so you slice wide pieces, across the grain of the meat.\n3 Make the salads: Toss together the lettuce greens, arugula, bell pepper, goat cheese, and scallions. Arrange on individual plates. Sprinkle with avocado. Lay on top several slices of chilled sliced steak. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds or sliced kumquats if using.\n4 Make dressing: Mix together the lemon juice, olive oil, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle on salad.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nSteak Salad with Arugula and Parmesan Cheese Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 11 minutesYield: 4 servings\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the salad\n5 ounces (about 6 cups) baby arugula\n2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving\nSalt and pepper, to taste\n1/2 cup (1 ounce) shaved Parmesan Cheese\nFor the steak\nVegetable oil (for the grill)\n2 (1 1/2-inch thick) sirloin steaks (about 1 3/4 pounds)\n2 lemons, cut into wedges (for serving)\nOlive oil (for serving)\nMETHOD\n1 Make the salad: In a bowl, toss the arugula with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and toss again. Mix in the Parmesan Cheese. Divide among four plates.\n2 Prepare the grill: For charcoal grills, fill a grill chimney with charcoal and light it. When the coals are hot (they should be covered with a layer of fine gray ash) empty the coals into the grill and push them to one side of the grill to make higher heat and lower heat cooking zones. Set the grate in place and cover the grill. Preheat the grate for 5 minutes.\nFor gas grills, heat one burner to high and one to low (225F).\nFold a small piece of paper towel to make a 2-inch square, and pour a few tablespoons of oil into a shallow bowl. With tongs, dip the square into the oil, and brush the grates.\n3 Cook the steaks: Brush the steaks with olive oil and sprinkle them on both sides with salt and pepper. Place them on the hot side of the grill and cook until browned and slightly charred on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the steaks over and continue to grill 3 minutes longer, or until well browned.\nIf the steaks aren't quite cooked to your desired doneness at this point, move them to the cooler side of the grill to finish cooking. Cook to an internal temperature of 135F for medium-rare, 140F for medium, or 150F for well done.\nTransfer the steaks to a cutting board or platter, tent loosely with foil and let rest 5 minutes before slicing.\n4 To serve: Slice the steaks and divide the slices between the plates, placing them on top of the arugula. Drizzle with olive oil and squeeze lemon juice over the top. Sprinkle with more salt and pepper, if you like.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nArugula Corn Salad with Bacon Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n4 large ears of corn\n2 cups of chopped arugula (about one bunch)\n4 strips of bacon, cooked, chopped\n1/3 cup chopped green onions\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon white wine vinegar\n1/8 teaspoon ground cumin\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the corn: Cook the corn ears, in their husks, either on the grill for a smoky flavor, or by steaming in a large covered stock pot with an inch of boiling water at the bottom of the pot, for 12-15 minutes, or by cooking in a microwave.\nLet the corn cool (can run under cold water to speed up the cooling), remove the husks and silk.\nI recommend cooking the corn in the husks for the added flavor that the husks impart. If you boil or steam the corn ears after you've already husked them, or if you cook them in the microwave, reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.\n2 Remove the corn kernels from the cobs: To remove the kernels from the cobs, stand a corn cob vertically with the tip on a small bowl that is inverted inside a larger, shallow bowl.\nUse a sharp knife to make long, downward strokes, removing the kernels from the cob, as you work your way around the cob.\nNote: it may help to work over a low table, to be in a better ergonomic position to cut the cobs this way.\n3 Make the dressing: In a separate bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, and cumin.\n4 Assemble the salad: In a medium sized bowl, mix together the corn, chopped arugula, bacon, and onions.\nMix dressing into salad just before serving. Taste and add more vinegar if necessary to balance the sweetness of the corn.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

It\xe2\x80\x99s best to supreme the citrus, which means to trim the peel off the citrus, then cut the individual segments of fruit from the inner membrane.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 slices (about 2 cups) sourdough bread, torn into bite-sized pieces\n1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1/2 cup chopped walnuts\n2 citrus fruits, like orange, lemon, and/or grapefruit\n1 small head radicchio (about 4 cups), cored and cut into bite-sized pieces\n2 cups arugula\n1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the croutons: Heat the oven to 350\xcb\x9aF. Place the bread pieces on a rimmed baking sheet and toss with 1/4 cup olive oil. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and bake, tossing the bread on the baking sheet partway through, until golden and crunchy, about 15 minutes; let cool.\n2 Toast the nuts: While the croutons are in the oven, toast the nuts in a medium-sized skillet set over medium heat on the stovetop until fragrant and toasted, about 8-10 minutes. Stay near the pan, and stir the nuts occasionally. They can go from toasted to burnt in a matter of seconds. Let cool.\n3 Peel and segment (a.k.a. supreme) the citrus : For each fruit, cut about an inch off the top and bottom just so some of the flesh is exposed. Set the fruit with the cut-side down on a cutting board.\nStart at the top, and slice down the side of the fruit with a sharp knife, cutting away the peel and the pith, exposing the flesh. Then carefully cut out the citrus segments over a bowl to collect the juice. You should have about 1 cup of citrus segments.\n4 Squeeze the juice: Once all of the segments have been removed, squeeze the juice from what's left of the fruit into the same bowl. Drain the juice from the segments and keep separate.\n5 Make the citrus vinaigrette: In a mason jar or small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons of the reserved citrus juice with the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Add pepper and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Secure the lid if using a jar, and shake vigorously for a few seconds until emulsified. If using a bowl, whisk the ingredients together.\n6 Assemble the salad: Add the radicchio and arugula to a large bowl. Drizzle with the vinaigrette and toss until evenly coated. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper to suit your preferences. Add the croutons, walnuts, citrus segments, and feta cheese, and toss until evenly combined.\n7 To serve: Transfer to a large serving bowl for family-style eating, or divide among individual bowls for serving.\nHello!

Rinse the asparagus spears. If the ends are tough, break them off and either discard or save for stock. You can also use a vegetable peeler to peel away the tough outer skin of the fatter ends of the asparagus if you want.\n2 Drizzle asparagus with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic: Line a roasting pan with foil. Arrange the asparagus spears in a single layer on the lined roasting pan.\nDrizzle with olive oil and rub the spears all over with the olive oil to coat. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and minced garlic, and rub over the asparagus spears to evenly distribute.\n3 Roast in oven: Roast at 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C) for 10 minutes, more or less, depending on your particular oven and how thick the spears are, until the asparagus are just lightly browned and tender when you pierce them with a fork.\n4 Drizzle with lemon juice or balsamic to serve: To serve, drizzle with fresh lemon juice or balsamic vinegar, and if you want, a sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese (skip if cooking vegan).\nHello!

Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside.\n2 Prepare the asparagus: Rinse and pat dry the asparagus. Snap off the tough ends of the asparagus. Set asparagus spears aside. (Reserve the snapped ends for another meal, if you like.)\n3 Wrap the asparagus with prosciutto: Cut prosciutto slices in half down their length. Wrap each spear of asparagus with one strip of sliced prosciutto. Tug the prosciutto a little as you wrap it around the asparagus to give it tension. This helps to ensure that the prosciutto wraps around the asparagus tightly.\nLay the wrapped asparagus spears on the lined sheet pan.\n4 Drizzle the asparagus with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Sprinkle a pinch of black pepper on top.\n5 Bake the asparagus for 8 to 10 minutes. When done, the asparagus will be bright green and easily pierced with a fork, and the prosciutto will be crisped around the edges.\n6 Serve the asparagus. Transfer the asparagus to a serving platter. Top with lemon zest and freshly grated parmesan cheese, if using. Serve immediately while hot.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Stir often to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan.\nContinue cooking and stirring rice, adding a little bit of broth at a time, cooking and stirring until it is absorbed, until the rice is tender, but still firm to the bite, about 20-25 minutes.\n5 Add the asparagus: With the last ladle of stock, add the asparagus. Stir and cook for a couple of minutes, until the risotto has absorbed the stock, but is still loose, and the asparagus are just cooked through.\nNote the stock amount given is approximate. You may need a little more or less. If you end up needing more stock and you find yourself without, just use water.\n6 Stir in the Parmesan, remaining butter, add salt, pepper: Turn off the heat.

Set your immersion circulator to 180\xc2\xb0F and let the water come up to temperature.\n2 Prep the asparagus: Wash the asparagus and, like a bunch of flowers, make a fresh cut on the bottom, eliminating any of the tough, woody ends.\nAdd the asparagus to a zip-top, gallon-sized plastic freezer bag. Add the black pepper and olive oil; save the salt for after it\xe2\x80\x99s cooked, as the salt will turn this green veggie a little grey. Toss together in the bag to distribute the ingredients.\nAdd a few heavy soup spoons to the bag to help weigh it down. This will help keep the asparagus submerged, which will ensure that it cooks evenly.\n  3 Seal the bag: Seal the bag as tightly as possible by using water-displacement method to help press out all the air. Just put the food in the bag and slowly lower it into the water, letting the pressure of the water press the air through the top of the bag. Once the air is out of the bag, seal it just above the water line. (Read more here.)\nYou can do this in the pot of water as it heats\xe2\x80\x94just be careful if the water is already steaming!\n4 Cook the asparagus: Once the water has come up to temperature, submerge the bag of asparagus in the pot of water. Make sure the bag is completely submerged (if it floats, remove it from the water and add a few more spoons to weigh it down).\n* Check the asparagus after 6 to 7 minutes if it\xe2\x80\x99s pencil thin.\n* Check average or thick asparagus after 8 to 10 minutes.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re at all in doubt, pull them out after 8 minutes, open the bag carefully, and use a fork to determine how tender the spears are. If the fork is getting stuck in the asparagus, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ready; reseal the bag and return it to the water for another minute or two.\n5 Serve: Remove from the water, turn off the circulator and serve immediately. Sprinkle some lemon juice and zest over the top of the asparagus, along with some of the cooking oil or butter (if desired) and some flaky sea salt, such as Maldon.\nLeftover asparagus will keep refrigerated for about 5 days.\nHello!

Bend the asparagus spears near the end and they will break naturally where the spear is no longer tough.\nFor an elegant presentation of the spears, use a vegetable peeler to peel off a very thin layer of the outer skin of the lower two to three inches of the asparagus spears.\nPrepare a large, shallow pan (with a cover) with a half inch of water and a steamer rack.\n2 Prepare the Hollandaise sauce: Melt the butter in a small pot. Put the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt and cayenne into a blender.\nBlend the eggs for 20-30 seconds at medium to medium high speed until lighter in color.\nTurn blender down to lowest setting and slowly drizzle in the hot melted butter while the blender is going. Continue to blend for a few seconds after all of the butter is incorporated.\nTaste the sauce and add more salt or lemon juice if needed. Keep warm while you are steaming the asparagus.\n3 Steam the asparagus: Bring the water in your steaming pan to a boil. Place the asparagus on the steaming rack. Cover.\nSteam for 3 to 5 minutes, until tender, but still a little crisp, definitely not mushy. The timing depends on how thick the asparagus spears are.\n4 Serve: To serve, plate the asparagus.

Add the asparagus and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain and shock the asparagus in ice water to stop the cooking.\n5 Mix eggs, milk, cheese: In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a fork or whisk. Whisk in the milk. Stir in the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir in the grated cheddar cheese.\n6 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n7 Place bread in egg milk mixture, fold in bacon and vegetables: Place the cubed bread in the egg milk mixture and press down with your hands so that the bread cubes absorb most of the egg milk mixture. Gently fold in the onions, bacon, asparagus, chopped artichoke hearts, and chives. (Be gentle as to not break up the bread.)\n8 Assemble the casserole: Generously butter the inside of a 2 1/2 to 3 quart (8 x 13 inch) casserole dish. Gently pour the bread egg milk vegetable mixture into the casserole dish and spread out in an even layer.\nAt this point you can make up to a day ahead.

Use 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme with the vegetables and 1/2 teaspoon sprinkled over the chicken.\nINGREDIENTS\n16 small new potatoes (red or golden), halved\n3 small sweet onions (such as Vidalia or Walla Walla), quartered through the roots; or 1 large super sweet onion, cut into thin wedges\n1 medium lemon, very thinly sliced\nLarge handful fresh lemon thyme or other fresh herb (oregano, marjoram, or thyme).\n5 tablespoons olive oil\n1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper, or more to taste\n2 large bone-in chicken breast halves (1 1/2 pounds, 680 g)\n2 whole chicken legs, thighs and drumsticks attached; or 2 legs and 2 drumsticks (1/2 pounds, 227 g)\n1 bunch (1 pound) fresh asparagus\nSpecial equipment:\nSheet pan, at least 11-by-17 inches or larger\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the vegetables for roasting: Heat the oven to 375F. In a bowl, combine the new potatoes, onions, lemon, a few of the herb sprigs, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and half the salt and pepper. Toss well and spread on a rimmed baking sheet.\n2 Roast the vegetables for 40 minutes, or until the potatoes are almost tender when pierced with a skewer.\n3 Prepare the chicken: While the vegetables roast, sprinkle the chicken with 2 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil, and the remaining salt and pepper. Remove the leaves from several thyme springs and scatter them on the chicken.\n4 Add the chicken to the vegetables and roast: Move the vegetables in the pan aside to make room for the chicken. Set the chicken in the pan, skin side up, so it isn\xe2\x80\x99t sitting on vegetables. Continue cooking for 30 minutes.\n5 Prepare the asparagus: Snap the spears near the base, where they break without much effort. Cut the spears in half to make shorter lengths. In a bowl, toss the asparagus with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil.\n6 Add the asparagus and roast: After the chicken has been roasting for 30 minutes, pull out the sheet pan and scatter the asparagus around the chicken.\n7 Continue roasting for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the chicken pieces all register at least 165\xc2\xb0F in the thickest part of the meat on an instant-read thermometer (the thighs will cook slightly faster than the breasts; you can pull them off the sheet pan as they reach temperature and keep them on a plate covered with foil, if you like).\nAll of the vegetables should also be cooked through. (Total cooking time is roughly 1 1/2 hours.)\nIf your chicken isn\xe2\x80\x99t brown enough, slide the pan under the broiler for 2 minutes, watching it carefully to avoid burning.\n8 To serve the chicken: Discard the cooked thyme sprigs. Use kitchen shears to separate the legs to form 2 drumsticks and 2 thighs. Snip the breasts in half horizontally.\nArrange the chicken and vegetables on a platter.

So keep your bacon chilled until you are ready to cut it, or put it in the freezer for several minutes before slicing.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 slices thick-sliced bacon (about 3 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 pound of asparagus, trimmed of woody ends, cut into 1/2-inch diagonal pieces\n6 slices of bread, cut into 1 1/2 inch wide square pieces, including crusts\n2 leeks, cleaned, cut in half lengthwise, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces, white and light green parts only, about 2 cups total\n2 Tbsp butter, divided 1 Tbsp and 1 Tbsp\n1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese\n8 eggs\n2 cups milk\n1/2 teaspoon of dried herbes de provence (can sub dried tarragon or thyme)\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Place bacon in a medium skillet on medium heat. Gently cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon pieces are lightly browned and much of the bacon fat has been rendered, about 10-12 minutes. Remove cooked bacon from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving the rendered bacon fat in the pan.\n2 While the bacon is cooking, cut up the bread. If the bread is a little stale, great. If it is fresh, then spread it out on a baking sheet and heat it in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for about 10-15 minutes to help it dry out a bit. This will help the keep the bread from disintegrating when mixed with the eggs later.\n3 Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the cut asparagus and blanch for 1 minute. Remove the asparagus from the pot to a bowl of ice water. Let cool in the ice water and then drain.\n4 Once the bacon is done and removed from the pan add a tablespoon of butter to the pan with the remaining bacon fat. Add the leeks and gently cook on medium to medium low heat for 10-12 minutes until the leeks are softened, but not browned. Do not let brown.\n5 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, crumbled feta cheese, herbes de provence, salt, and pepper.\n6 Place the bread pieces into the egg milk mixture and press down so that the bread becomes completely saturated with the mixture. Add the asparagus and leeks and gently mix to combine, taking care to not break up the bread.\n7 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. With the remaining tablespoon of butter, butter the insides of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle the bacon over the bottom of the dish. Gently pour the filling mixture into the casserole. Top with Parmesan cheese. Push the grated Parmesan down a bit into to the top of the casserole so that it gets moistened. (At this point you can make the night before, refrigerate and bake the next morning.)\n8 Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and the custard is cooked through. If the top is getting too brown before the custard is done, you can tent it with foil. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before cutting to serve.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nRoasted Asparagus Recipe\nPrep time: 6 minutesCook time: 12 minutesYield: Serves 4\nFor best results for roasting asparagus, use thick asparagus spears, not skinny ones. The thin ones will dry out too quickly and will end up tough and stringy.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound asparagus spears (thick spears are best for roasting)\n1-2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, minced\nKosher Salt\nFreshly grated black pepper\nLemon juice (or balsamic vinegar)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven and prep asparagus: Preheat your oven to 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C). Rinse the asparagus spears. If the ends are tough, break them off and either discard or save for stock.

Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside.\n2 Prepare the asparagus: Rinse and pat dry the asparagus. Snap off the tough ends of the asparagus. Set asparagus spears aside. (Reserve the snapped ends for another meal, if you like.)\n3 Wrap the asparagus with prosciutto: Cut prosciutto slices in half down their length. Wrap each spear of asparagus with one strip of sliced prosciutto. Tug the prosciutto a little as you wrap it around the asparagus to give it tension. This helps to ensure that the prosciutto wraps around the asparagus tightly.\nLay the wrapped asparagus spears on the lined sheet pan.\n4 Drizzle the asparagus with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Sprinkle a pinch of black pepper on top.\n5 Bake the asparagus for 8 to 10 minutes. When done, the asparagus will be bright green and easily pierced with a fork, and the prosciutto will be crisped around the edges.\n6 Serve the asparagus. Transfer the asparagus to a serving platter.

Set your immersion circulator to 180\xc2\xb0F and let the water come up to temperature.\n2 Prep the asparagus: Wash the asparagus and, like a bunch of flowers, make a fresh cut on the bottom, eliminating any of the tough, woody ends.\nAdd the asparagus to a zip-top, gallon-sized plastic freezer bag. Add the black pepper and olive oil; save the salt for after it\xe2\x80\x99s cooked, as the salt will turn this green veggie a little grey. Toss together in the bag to distribute the ingredients.\nAdd a few heavy soup spoons to the bag to help weigh it down. This will help keep the asparagus submerged, which will ensure that it cooks evenly.\n  3 Seal the bag: Seal the bag as tightly as possible by using water-displacement method to help press out all the air. Just put the food in the bag and slowly lower it into the water, letting the pressure of the water press the air through the top of the bag. Once the air is out of the bag, seal it just above the water line. (Read more here.)\nYou can do this in the pot of water as it heats\xe2\x80\x94just be careful if the water is already steaming!\n4 Cook the asparagus: Once the water has come up to temperature, submerge the bag of asparagus in the pot of water. Make sure the bag is completely submerged (if it floats, remove it from the water and add a few more spoons to weigh it down).\n* Check the asparagus after 6 to 7 minutes if it\xe2\x80\x99s pencil thin.\n* Check average or thick asparagus after 8 to 10 minutes.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re at all in doubt, pull them out after 8 minutes, open the bag carefully, and use a fork to determine how tender the spears are. If the fork is getting stuck in the asparagus, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ready; reseal the bag and return it to the water for another minute or two.\n5 Serve: Remove from the water, turn off the circulator and serve immediately. Sprinkle some lemon juice and zest over the top of the asparagus, along with some of the cooking oil or butter (if desired) and some flaky sea salt, such as Maldon.\nLeftover asparagus will keep refrigerated for about 5 days.\nHello!

OR you can use stale bread that is no longer soft. Drying the bread in the oven will help keep it from falling apart when you add the egg mixture later.\n2 Cook the chopped bacon: Place bacon in medium skillet on medium high heat. Cook until bacon is lightly browned and much of the fat rendered. Remove bacon from pan with a slotted spoon, place on a paper towel lined plate to drain. Pour off all but enough bacon fat to coat the bottom of the pan (do not put down the drain, it will clog your pipes).\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions: Add chopped onions to the pan with bacon fat. Cook on medium high heat until lightly browned, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the bacon back to the pan with the onions, stir, remove from heat.\n4 Blanch the asparagus: While the onions are cooking, bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the asparagus and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain and shock the asparagus in ice water to stop the cooking.\n5 Mix eggs, milk, cheese: In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a fork or whisk. Whisk in the milk. Stir in the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir in the grated cheddar cheese.\n6 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n7 Place bread in egg milk mixture, fold in bacon and vegetables: Place the cubed bread in the egg milk mixture and press down with your hands so that the bread cubes absorb most of the egg milk mixture. Gently fold in the onions, bacon, asparagus, chopped artichoke hearts, and chives.

b"Save It Print\nSheet Pan Chicken with Asparagus and Potatoes Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesYield: 4 servings\nIf you can't find the chicken parts called for in this recipe, you can buy a whole chicken and cut it into parts yourself (or ask a butcher to do it for you).\nIf you don't have fresh herbs, you can substitute dried thyme. Use 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme with the vegetables and 1/2 teaspoon sprinkled over the chicken.\nINGREDIENTS\n16 small new potatoes (red or golden), halved\n3 small sweet onions (such as Vidalia or Walla Walla), quartered through the roots; or 1 large super sweet onion, cut into thin wedges\n1 medium lemon, very thinly sliced\nLarge handful fresh lemon thyme or other fresh herb (oregano, marjoram, or thyme).\n5 tablespoons olive oil\n1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper, or more to taste\n2 large bone-in chicken breast halves (1 1/2 pounds, 680 g)\n2 whole chicken legs, thighs and drumsticks attached; or 2 legs and 2 drumsticks (1/2 pounds, 227 g)\n1 bunch (1 pound) fresh asparagus\nSpecial equipment:\nSheet pan, at least 11-by-17 inches or larger\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the vegetables for roasting: Heat the oven to 375F. In a bowl, combine the new potatoes, onions, lemon, a few of the herb sprigs, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and half the salt and pepper. Toss well and spread on a rimmed baking sheet.\n2 Roast the vegetables for 40 minutes, or until the potatoes are almost tender when pierced with a skewer.\n3 Prepare the chicken: While the vegetables roast, sprinkle the chicken with 2 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil, and the remaining salt and pepper. Remove the leaves from several thyme springs and scatter them on the chicken.\n4 Add the chicken to the vegetables and roast: Move the vegetables in the pan aside to make room for the chicken. Set the chicken in the pan, skin side up, so it isn\xe2\x80\x99t sitting on vegetables. Continue cooking for 30 minutes.\n5 Prepare the asparagus: Snap the spears near the base, where they break without much effort. Cut the spears in half to make shorter lengths. In a bowl, toss the asparagus with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil.\n6 Add the asparagus and roast: After the chicken has been roasting for 30 minutes, pull out the sheet pan and scatter the asparagus around the chicken.\n7 Continue roasting for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the chicken pieces all register at least 165\xc2\xb0F in the thickest part of the meat on an instant-read thermometer (the thighs will cook slightly faster than the breasts; you can pull them off the sheet pan as they reach temperature and keep them on a plate covered with foil, if you like).\nAll of the vegetables should also be cooked through. (Total cooking time is roughly 1 1/2 hours.)\nIf your chicken isn\xe2\x80\x99t brown enough, slide the pan under the broiler for 2 minutes, watching it carefully to avoid burning.\n8 To serve the chicken: Discard the cooked thyme sprigs. Use kitchen shears to separate the legs to form 2 drumsticks and 2 thighs. Snip the breasts in half horizontally.\nArrange the chicken and vegetables on a platter. Remove the thyme from the remaining fresh sprigs and sprinkle it over the chicken.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nBreakfast Casserole with Leeks and Asparagus Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nPro tip: raw bacon is much easier to slice if it is frozen. So keep your bacon chilled until you are ready to cut it, or put it in the freezer for several minutes before slicing.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 slices thick-sliced bacon (about 3 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 pound of asparagus, trimmed of woody ends, cut into 1/2-inch diagonal pieces\n6 slices of bread, cut into 1 1/2 inch wide square pieces, including crusts\n2 leeks, cleaned, cut in half lengthwise, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces, white and light green parts only, about 2 cups total\n2 Tbsp butter, divided 1 Tbsp and 1 Tbsp\n1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese\n8 eggs\n2 cups milk\n1/2 teaspoon of dried herbes de provence (can sub dried tarragon or thyme)\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Place bacon in a medium skillet on medium heat. Gently cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon pieces are lightly browned and much of the bacon fat has been rendered, about 10-12 minutes. Remove cooked bacon from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving the rendered bacon fat in the pan.\n2 While the bacon is cooking, cut up the bread. If the bread is a little stale, great. If it is fresh, then spread it out on a baking sheet and heat it in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for about 10-15 minutes to help it dry out a bit. This will help the keep the bread from disintegrating when mixed with the eggs later.\n3 Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the cut asparagus and blanch for 1 minute. Remove the asparagus from the pot to a bowl of ice water. Let cool in the ice water and then drain.\n4 Once the bacon is done and removed from the pan add a tablespoon of butter to the pan with the remaining bacon fat. Add the leeks and gently cook on medium to medium low heat for 10-12 minutes until the leeks are softened, but not browned. Do not let brown.\n5 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, crumbled feta cheese, herbes de provence, salt, and pepper.\n6 Place the bread pieces into the egg milk mixture and press down so that the bread becomes completely saturated with the mixture. Add the asparagus and leeks and gently mix to combine, taking care to not break up the bread.\n7 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. With the remaining tablespoon of butter, butter the insides of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle the bacon over the bottom of the dish. Gently pour the filling mixture into the casserole. Top with Parmesan cheese. Push the grated Parmesan down a bit into to the top of the casserole so that it gets moistened. (At this point you can make the night before, refrigerate and bake the next morning.)\n8 Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and the custard is cooked through. If the top is getting too brown before the custard is done, you can tent it with foil. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before cutting to serve.\nHello!

Heat on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and lightly browned.\nRemove pine nuts from pan and set aside. You will use 3/4 cup of the pine nuts for the pesto paste and 1/4 cup to mix in whole.\n3 Blanch asparagus: Salt the asparagus water and drop the spears into the pan. Cook for only 2 or 3 minutes, until the spears are bright green and barely tender.\nDrain under cool water to stop the cooking. Cut the tips off, and set aside, several of the asparagus (diagonal cut about an inch from the end) to use for garnish.\n4 Make asparagus pesto: Add the asparagus, spinach, garlic, Parmesan, and 3/4 cup of the pine nuts to a food processor.\nPur\xc3\xa9e and, with the motor running, drizzle in the 1/4 cup of olive oil until a paste forms. If too thick, thin it with a bit of the pasta water.\nAdd the lemon juice and salt, taste and adjust seasoning.\nHere's a trick that Heidi taught me. When emptying the food processor bowl of its contents, hold the bottom of the bowl with one hand with a finger in the center hole, holding the blade in place and keeping it from falling out.\n5 Make pasta, toss with pesto: Salt the pasta water well and cook the pasta until just tender. Check the directions on the pasta package. You'll need more time for dried pasta and less for fresh.\n\nThis fresh pasta cooked up in no time at all.\nDrain and toss immediately with 1 cup of the asparagus pesto.\nServe sprinkled with the remaining 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts, a dusting of Parmesan, and a light drizzle of olive oil.\nHello!

Press the dough all around the bottom edge so it sticks to the pan. With scissors, cut the pastry around the top edge so it has an even 1-inch overhang.\n2 Crimp the dough: Tuck the overhang inside the pan all around, like a hem. Crimp the top edge with your fingers.\n3 Chill the pie crust: Set the pie crust on a rimmed baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and freeze for 1 hour. (At this point, you can freeze it overnight, loosely covered; if you want to freeze for up to 1 month, wrap tightly after the crust is frozen).\n4 Blind bake the pie crust: Heat the oven to 375F. Prick the dough all over with a fork. Line the dough with parchment paper or crumpled foil, and fill with pie weights or dried beans.\nBake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the top edge of the pastry is beginning to take on some color. Lift off the paper or foil and beans, and set aside. Return the pie crust to the oven and continue baking for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the bottom of the dough is beginning to cook through. If the dough forms puffs, prick them with the tip of a knife.\nSet on a wire rack to cool. Leave the oven on.\n5 Prepare the asparagus: Snap off the dry and woody part of the spears near the base, where they break without much effort. Cut the spears into 1-inch pieces.\nBring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add the asparagus and cook for 1 minute. Drain and transfer the asparagus to ice water to cool.\nDry the asparagus with paper towels. Set aside 3 asparagus tips to garnish the quiche. Halve the remaining pieces lengthwise.\n6 Finish the filling: Scatter the blanched asparagus (not the tips) and Fontina over the bottom of the cooled pie crust. Thoroughly stir the cream into the eggs, add salt and pepper, and pour the egg mixture over the asparagus and cheese.\n7 Bake the quiche: Return the pan to the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the filling is set all over and the top is starting to brown. Set on a wire rack to cool completely.\n8 Serve: Garnish the top of the quiche with the reserved asparagus tips before serving.\nThe quiche can be served immediately, or once cool, cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Quiche can be served cold, room temperature, or warm. (If serving warm, heat in a 300F oven until just warm to the touch.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Wash your hands thoroughly after handling and do not touch your eyes or the area near your eyes with your hands for several hours.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 ripe avocados\n1/4 teaspoon of salt, more to taste\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice or lemon juice\n2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup of minced red onion or thinly sliced green onion\n1-2 serrano chiles, stems and seeds removed, minced\n2 tablespoons cilantro (leaves and tender stems), finely chopped\nA dash of freshly grated black pepper\n1/2 ripe tomato, seeds and pulp removed, chopped\nRed radishes or jicama, to garnish\nTortilla chips, to serve\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cut the avocado, remove flesh: Cut the avocados in half. Remove the pit. Score the inside of the avocado with a blunt knife and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. (See How to Cut and Peel an Avocado.) Place in a bowl.\n2 Mash with a fork: Using a fork, roughly mash the avocado. (Don't overdo it! The guacamole should be a little chunky.)\n3 Add salt, lime juice, and the rest: Sprinkle with salt and lime (or lemon) juice. The acid in the lime juice will provide some balance to the richness of the avocado and will help delay the avocados from turning brown.\nAdd the chopped onion, cilantro, black pepper, and chiles. Chili peppers vary individually in their hotness. So, start with a half of one chili pepper and add to the guacamole to your desired degree of hotness.\nRemember that much of this is done to taste because of the variability in the fresh ingredients. Start with this recipe and adjust to your taste.\nChilling tomatoes hurts their flavor, so if you want to add chopped tomato to your guacamole, add it just before serving.\n4 Serve: Serve immediately, or if making a few hours ahead, place plastic wrap on the surface of the guacamole and press down to cover it and to prevent air reaching it. (The oxygen in the air causes oxidation which will turn the guacamole brown.) Refrigerate until ready to serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nHow to Cut and Peel an Avocado\nPrep time: 1 minute\nINGREDIENTS\n1 avocado\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Grip the avocado gently on one side with one hand. With a large, sharp knife in the other hand, cut the avocado lengthwise around the seed. Open the two halves to expose the pit.\n2a At this point there are a few ways you can proceed to remove the pit from the avocado half that has the pit. One way is to use a spoon to scoop out the pit.\nOne way is to make another cut, lengthwise on the avocado half that has the pit, cutting around the pit, exposing it so that it is easier to remove.\n2b Another method is a bit tricky, as you'll see. This method is very popular, but you must be careful lest you cut your hand. For safety, fold up a kitchen towel and use that to hold the avocado half with the pit.\nGently tap the pit with a knife with enough force so that the knife edge wedges into the pit, but not so hard as to cut all the way through it. If unsure, just tap it very gently a few times, each time with increasing pressure, until a cut is made in the pit sufficiently to twist the pit out. Getting the pressure just right takes a little practice.\nWith the edge of the knife, twist the pit out of the avocado and discard.\n3a At this point, you can either scoop out the avocado flesh with a spoon (for making guacamole), or slice the avocado into segments.\nTo make it more easy to scoop out the avocado flesh, take a knife (you can easily use a dull dinner knife) and gently make cuts in the avocado flesh in a cross-hatch pattern, careful not to break through the avocado peel. Then use a spoon to easily scoop out the avocado pieces.\nIf you are making guacamole, don't worry about slightly discolored or brownish sections. Scoop them up with the rest of the avocado to mash.\n3b To make avocado slices, use a knife to slice the inside of the avocado halves into sections. Don't worry if you cut right through the peel.\n4 Use your fingers to separate the avocado segments from the peel.\n  Hello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Fill a saucepan with 1 inch of water and insert a steamer basket. (If you don't have a steamer basket, that's ok.)\nBring the water to a boil, gently place 6 eggs in the steamer basket or directly in the saucepan. Cover the pot. Set your timer for 15 minutes. Remove eggs and set in icy cold water to cool. For more advice, see our How to Steam Hard Boiled Eggs. (You can also pressure cook them.)\n2 Prep the eggs: Once they've cooled, carefully peel the hard boiled eggs and cut them in half lengthwise. Place them on a serving platter. Scoop out the cooked yolks and set aside.\n3 Make the filling: Cut the avocados in half. Remove the pit. Scoop out the avocado flesh and place in a bowl. (See How to Cut and Peel an Avocado.)\nRoughly mash with a fork. Use your fingers to break up one or two of the cooked egg yolks (2 to 4 halves) over the mashed avocado. (Reserve the remaining egg yolks for another use.) Sprinkle with lime juice and salt, and stir in the sour cream. Stir in the chopped cilantro, serrano or jalape\xc3\xb1o chile pepper, and chives.\n4 Fill the egg halves: Scoop a generous spoonful of the avocado mixture into each well of the hard boiled egg whites.

b'Save It Print\nPan Seared Salmon with Avocado Remoulade Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n2 large avocados, cut and peeled\n3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice (can substitute lemon)\n3-4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon minced shallots or green onion\n1 tablespoon minced parsley\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard or to taste\nSalt and pepper to taste\n1 to 1 1/2 pounds of salmon fillets\nMETHOD\n1 Make avocado remoulade sauce: Put avocado pieces and lime juice into a food processor or blender and pulse until blended.\nSlowly add olive oil, pulsing, until you reach desired consistency of sauce.\nAdd minced shallots (or green onions) and parsley, pulse just until combined.\nRemove to a bowl, add mustard, salt and pepper to taste.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 salmon fillets: Heat a tablespoon of oil in a saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium high heat.\nSeason both sides of the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Place the fillets in the hot pan and lower the heat to medium.\nIf your fillets are skin-on, you can either place the fillets in the pan skin-side up or skin-side down. If you first place the fillets skin-side up, the fillets will be easier to turn over without falling apart, because the raw skin will help hold the fillet together. If you place the fillets in the pan skin-side down to start, this will help crisp up the skin, which can be a tasty treat on its own.\nCook the salmon until about medium doneness, about 3-4 minutes per side.\n3 Serve: Serve salmon with avocado remoulade sauce.\nHello!

b'Print\nSalmon Avocado Poke Bowl Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesYield: 2 to 3 servings\nI use short-grain white rice (sometimes also called "sushi rice") in my bowls, but it\'s fine to use medium- or long-grain rice if that\'s what you have in your kitchen.\nGluten-free option: Substitute 3 tablespoons of tamari for the soy sauce. Because of the deeper color of the tamari, your salmon may not look as vibrant once mixed with the dressing.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the poke bowl:\n1 cup short-grain white rice\n1 pound sashimi-grade salmon\n1/4 cup soy sauce\n1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n1/2 tablespoon sugar\n1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil\n1/4 teaspoon garlic powder\n2 scallions, thinly sliced\nOther toppings for your bowl:\nSliced cucumber\nSliced radish\n1 large avocado, cubed\nFurikake\nRed pepper flakes\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the rice: Start the rice first and prep the rest of the ingredients while it cooks. Rinse the rice a few times under cool water, rubbing it gently with your hands, until the water isn\'t quite so cloudy. Then cook the rice according to package instructions or in a rice cooker. Fluff and keep covered until ready to eat.\n2 Prepare the salmon: Gently pat the salmon all over to make sure that there are no pin bones still lodged in the fillet; if there are, use needle-nosed pliers to remove them. Cut the salmon into 1/2-inch cubes. Add the salmon into a medium bowl and set aside.\n3 Make the dressing: In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sugar and garlic powder. The garlic powder and sugar will not dissolve completely, but that\'s fine.\n4 Combine the salmon and the dressing: Add the sliced scallions to the bowl with the salmon, saving 1 to 2 tablespoons for garnish. Add the soy sauce mixture to the salmon and scallions. Using a large spoon or a rubber spatula, gently mix the salmon with the soy sauce mixture.\n5 Serve: Divide the rice between each bowl and then the salmon. Top with the rest of the sliced scallions, sliced cucumber, sliced radishes, diced avocado, furikake and red pepper flakes, if you like. The poke bowl is best enjoyed immediately.\nHello!

Roast the peppers for 7-8 minutes until the skins are charred and blistered, turning the peppers as they begin to shake, and the seeds inside make snapping noises.\n2 Steam the peppers and remove the skins: Once the peppers have been charred, remove them from the heat. Put the peppers into a shallow dish or bowl and cover them with a towel to steam.\nAfter the peppers steam, their skins are easy to remove. Use the back of your knife to scrape the charred, papery skins from the peppers, then discard.\n3 Dice the peppers: Once the skins have been removed, slice off the stem end of each pepper. Cut the poblano and jalape\xc3\xb1os in half lengthwise, then scrape away the white membrane and the seeds with the back side of your knife (this helps prevent scraping away valuable pepper flesh).\nBecause serrano peppers are so skinny, rather than slice them in half, use the back of your knife blade and drag it down the length of the pepper to push the seeds out from the cut end.\nDice the peppers into 1/4-inch pieces.\n4 Mash the avocados: Cut the avocados in half and remove, then discard the pits. Scoop the avocado flesh into the mixing bowl and use a fork or potato masher to smash the avocado into a semi-chunky paste.\nGently stir in the lime juice to help delay the browning of the avocado. Try to avoid stirring too much as it will break up the avocado.\n5 Finish the guacamole: Fold in the chiles, red onion, cilantro, cumin, and salt until the ingredients are well incorporated. Taste the guacamole and adjust the salt to suit your preference.\n6 Allow the flavors to meld: Press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface of the guacamole and cover your bowl with a lid. Refrigerate the guacamole for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors of the chiles and the cumin to meld and deepen.\nEnjoy the guacamole within 3 days. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator. If the guacamole browns, scrape off the brown layer and discard before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nSpaghetti Pasta Carbonara Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Serves 4-6\nThis recipe uses raw eggs, which are essentially cooked by tossing with hot pasta. They are not cooked to the point of scrambled though, just enough to thicken the eggs into a sauce.\nThe garlic is optional. It is not usually included in pasta carbonara, but it tastes great so we\'ve included it. By the way, "guanciale", or pork jowl, is traditionally used in this dish, so if you can get it, by all means use it.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter\n1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced\n1-2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)\n3-4 whole eggs\n1 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese\n1 pound spaghetti pasta (or bucatini or fettuccine)\nSalt and black pepper to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat pasta water: Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water.)\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 pancetta/bacon and garlic: While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.\nAdd the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.\n3 Beat eggs and half of the cheese: In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.\n4 Cook pasta: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.\n5 Toss pasta with pancetta/bacon: When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.\nMove the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It\'s the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.\nToss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn\'t make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That\'s the tricky part.)\n6 Add the beaten egg mixture: Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.\nServe at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper.\nIf you want, sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley.\nHello!

Have on hand a rimmed baking sheet.\n2 Make the stuffing: In a skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the apple, onion, rosemary, and thyme, and cook for 7 to 9 minutes, or until softened. Meanwhile, pulse the bread slices in a food processor until you make coarse crumbs. You should have about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs.\nRemove the pan with the onions and apples from the heat, and stir in the breadcrumbs, mustard, salt, and pepper. Set aside to cool briefly.\n3 Butterfly the tenderloin: Cut a deep lengthwise slit down the center of the tenderloin, stopping about 1/2-inch from the bottom of the roast. Open it up like a book. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap, and with a mallet or rolling pin, gently pound it until it is of an even thickness.\n4 Stuff the tenderloin: Spread the stuffing in a line along the center of the meat. Bring the edges of the meat together to return it to its original shape. Secure with toothpicks.\n5 Wrap the bacon slices around the meat: Lay out the bacon slices on a cutting board, overlapping them slightly. Place the tenderloin on top with the toothpicks facing up. Removing the toothpicks as you work, wrap the bacon slices around the pork to form a log. Place the tenderloin, bacon seam side down, on the baking sheet. \n6 Roast the tenderloin: Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 145F to 150F and the bacon is brown and crisp. If the roast is ready before the bacon browns, place the tenderloin under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes to brown the bacon.\n7 Let the tenderloin rest for 10 minutes before cutting into slices.

b"Save It Print\nBean and Bacon Soup Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesBean soaking time: 8 hoursYield: Serves 6 to 8\nIn this recipe we are making the bean soup starting with dry beans that we soak overnight. If you don't have time to soak beans overnight, you can put the beans into a pot of water, bring the water to a boil, remove from heat, and let sit for hour, and then drain. Pre-soaking the beans will help them cook faster.\nIf you would rather work with canned beans, use 3 to 4 15-ounce cans of drained white beans and cook them in step 3 for only 15 minutes, not an hour.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound dry Great Northern white beans, covered with a couple inches of water and soaked overnight\n5 ounces of bacon, cut into 1/2-inch wide pieces\n2 cups chopped onion (1 large onion)\n3/4 cup chopped celery (about 2 ribs of celery)\n3/4 cup chopped carrots (1 large carrot)\n3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)\n6 cups chicken stock\n2 bay leaves\n1 Tbsp fresh thyme\n2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n3 Tbsp tomato paste\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n1 ounce bacon (1 to 2 slices), cooked and crumbled for garnish (optional)\n2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Drain the beans: Drain the beans that have been soaking in water. (If you haven't already soaked the beans, and you don't have time to do so overnight, you can put them in a large pot of water, bring to a boil, remove from heat and let sit for an hour, then drain.)\n2 Cook the bacon and vegetables: Put the bacon into a large (5 to 6 quart) thick-bottomed Dutch oven on medium high heat. Let the bacon cook for a minute or two to start rendering out some of its fat, then add the chopped onion, celery, and carrots.\nLower the heat to low, cover and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, until vegetables are completely cooked through and softened. Add the garlic and cook a minute more.\n3 Add beans, stock, seasonings, simmer: Add the drained beans to the pot. Add the stock, the bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper.\nIncrease heat to high to bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour or until the beans are very soft.\n4 Add tomato paste and paprika: Stir in the tomato paste and the paprika. Cook for 5 more minutes.\n5 Pur\xc3\xa9e half the soup: Remove the bay leaves. Using an immersion blender, pur\xc3\xa9e most of the soup. You don't want the soup to be perfectly smooth, but you want to pur\xc3\xa9e enough of it so that the beans create a creamy base.\nAdd more salt and pepper to taste.\nGarnish with crumbled cooked bacon and chopped parsley to serve.\nHello!

b'Print\nSour Cream and Bacon Deviled Eggs Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 30 minutes\nI use granulated garlic in this recipe because it mixes better into the egg yolk mixture and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the raw bite of freshly minced garlic. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have granulated garlic or garlic powder on hand, I would mix in 1/2 to 1 full tablespoon of minced onions instead.\nINGREDIENTS\n12 large eggs\n1/2 cup full-fat sour cream\n1 to 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic\n3 to 4 strips of bacon\n1 1/2 tablespoons chopped chives\nGround paprika, to garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Steam the eggs: Fill a pot with 1 to 1 1/2 inches of water. Place a steamer basket inside and bring water to a boil. Once the water boils, turn off the heat. Carefully place 6 eggs into the steamer basket. Cover the pot and return the heat to medium-high. Let the eggs steam for 15 minutes.\nUsing a slotted spoon, remove the eggs and place them in a bowl of ice cold water. Repeat with steaming the remaining 6 eggs. (Get the step-by-step tutorial for making steam-cooked eggs here.)\n2 Let the eggs sit in the ice water for 30 minutes: You may need to add more ice cubes if the heat from the first batch of cooked eggs melts the ice cubes and warms the water.\n3 Peel the eggs and slice each egg in half. Scoop out the egg yolks and place them in a bowl.\n4 Make the deviled egg filling: Using a fork, smash the yolks into small pieces. Add the sour cream, mustard, salt and granulated garlic and mix until you get a smooth mixture. Taste the filling and adjust the seasonings to your liking. Set the filling aside as you cook the bacon.\n5 Cook the bacon: Heat a frying pan over medium heat and cook the bacon to your desired level of crispiness. I usually cook mine for 5 to 6 minutes, until I see some browning on the bacon strips.\nUse tongs to remove the bacon from pan and onto a plate lined with paper towels. Let the bacon cool for a few minutes. Once the bacon is cool enough to handle, chop or crumble bacon strips into small pieces.\n6 Fill the deviled eggs: Fill a zip-top sandwich bag with the egg yolk mixture. Snip off one of the bottom corners and pipe the egg yolk mixture into the egg white halves. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a sandwich or piping bag on hand, you can also just spoon in the egg yolk mixture into the egg white halves.\n7 Sprinkle each egg with chives, paprika, and bacon bits. Serve immediately. Deviled eggs can also be refrigerated for a few hours before serving, but are best served the day they are made.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nBacon-Wrapped Shrimp Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 10 minutesBrining time (optional) time: 30 minutesYield: Makes 12 pieces\nYou'll need about 1 strip of bacon for every 2 shrimp.\nI highly recommend brining the shrimp first. The brine will help keep the shrimp from drying out in the time it takes for the bacon to cook.\nIf grilling, I recommend using long, flat skewers which make turning the shrimp on the grill easier. If you don't have flat skewers, I've used two thin bamboo skewers (soaked in water for 30 minutes beforehand) to the same effect.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the brine (optional, but recommended):\n1/4 cup (Diamond Crystal) kosher salt (if using Morton's kosher salt, use only 3 tablespoons)\n1/4 cup sugar\n4 cups water\n1 cup ice\nFor the bacon-wrapped shrimp:\n1 pound (12 to 20 count), raw, peeled and deveined shrimp (tail on)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\nZest from 1 lime\n2 tablespoons lime juice\n1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder or chili powder (less or more to taste)\n6 to 10 strips thin bacon, cut in half (half as many pieces of bacon as there are shrimp)\nSpecial equipment:\nSkewers (for grilling) or toothpicks (for oven)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brine the shrimp (optional, but recommended): Whisk the salt, sugar, and water until the salt and sugar dissolve. Add the ice and the shrimp, and let sit for 30 minutes (no longer). Remove the shrimp from the brine.\n2 Prepare grill or preheat oven: Prepare grill on high, direct heat (if grilling) or preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. If grilling and using thin bamboo or wood skewers, soak them in water first for 30 minutes.\n3 Season the shrimp: Mix together in a small bowl the lime zest, lime juice, olive oil, and chipotle powder. Stir the shrimp into the lime chipotle mixture; make sure each piece is well coated.\n4 Partially cook the bacon: Spread the bacon pieces out over several layers of paper towels on a microwave-safe plate. Cover with another layer of paper towel. Microwave on high until the bacon fat begins to melt but the bacon is still somewhat pliable, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.\n5 Wrap the shrimp with bacon: Working one at a time, wrap a half piece of partially cooked bacon around each piece of shrimp.\n6 Prep the shrimp for cooking: If you are grilling, thread the shrimp onto skewers.\nIf you are using the oven, secure each the bacon onto the shrimp with toothpicks. Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp on a foil-lined baking pan. Brush remaining lime chipotle mixture on the outside of the bacon-wrapped shrimp.\n7 Grill or bake the shrimp: Grill uncovered for 3 minutes on each side (less or more time depending on the heat of your grill), or bake in the 400\xc2\xb0F oven for 8 to 11 minutes, or until the bacon is lightly browned and the shrimp is cooked through.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nGoat Cheese Bacon Pops Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesYield: 1 dozen pops\nRegular sliced bacon is better than thick-cut bacon for this recipe since it crumbles more easily, but thick-cut is also fine if that\'s what you normally buy.\nPackages of goat cheese sometimes go by the name "chevre" in the store. Either is fine.\nINGREDIENTS\n6 slices bacon\n4 ounces goat cheese\n4 ounces cream cheese (lower fat is fine here, if you prefer)\n1 tablespoon mild honey\nPinch dried chili flakes (optional)\n1/3 cup dried cherries (cranberries, blueberries, or other tart dried fruit works well, too)\n1/2 cup lightly packed fresh herbs (I used parsley and chives)\n1/2 cup unsalted pecan halves\nSpecial equipment:\nAppetizer skewers\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the bacon: In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy. Drain on a paper towel. This can be done several days in advance; store in the fridge until needed.\n2 Make the cheese mix: In a food processor, combine goat cheese, cream cheese, honey, chili flakes (if using), a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper. Blitz for about 30 seconds, then scrape down the sides of the bowl and pulse a few more times to fully combine. Transfer to a small bowl and freeze for 10 to 20 minutes, until firm but not frozen solid. (The cheese can be mixed up to 2 days in advance; store in the fridge.)\n3 Make the bacon topping: While the cheese mix is chilling, clean your food processor to make your filling. Place the dried cherries in the food processor and blend in 1-second pulses until they\xe2\x80\x99re chopped into tiny bits. Add herbs and pulse another 5 or so times. Add bacon and pecans and pulse until the mixture looks crumbly. Do not over-mix or you will end up with bacony nut butter. Transfer coating to a bowl.\n4 Roll the cheese into balls: Remove the cheese mixture from the freezer and roll into twelve little balls (a scant tablespoon each). Wetting your hands in cool water helps to cut down on the mess.\n5 Roll the cheese balls in the bacon topping: Gently press the coating into the cheese to make it stick.\n6 Stick a small stick or skewer into your cheese balls and store in the fridge until you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to serve. The pops are best the day they are made, but will keep just fine in the fridge for several hours before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nBaked Potato Soup Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesYield: Serves 4 to 6\nPotatoes love salt, so if you are using homemade stock or low sodium stock that isn't well seasoned, you'll need to add more to this soup to make up the difference.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 pounds russet potatoes (about 7 medium potatoes)\n1/4 pound thick sliced bacon, cut crosswise into 1/8-inch slices (lardons)\n1 large onion, finely chopped (about 2 cups)\n2 ribs celery, finely chopped\n6 cups chicken stock\n1 teaspoon kosher salt (more to taste)\n1/8 teaspoon of ground white or black pepper\n2 to 4 tablespoons heavy cream (optional)\nGarnishes:\nGrated sharp cheddar cheese\nSour cream\nMinced chives\nCrumbled bacon (from step 2 in method)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Bake the potatoes: Scrub the potatoes clean and poke them all over with the tines of a fork or paring knife (this is so they don't explode from internal pressure building up as they cook). Place on a foil lined baking sheet and bake at 400\xc2\xb0F for 1 hour, or until easily cut through with a knife.\nRemove and let cool enough to handle. (To speed up cooling, slice them in half lengthwise.)\n2 Cook the bacon: Place bacon lardons in a large, thick bottomed Dutch oven (about 5 to 6 quart pot). Heat on medium high until the bacon starts to brown then lower the heat to medium.\nCook until the bacon has rendered most of its fat and the lardons are browned and crispy. Remove the cooked bacon and set aside.\nRemove all but 1 tablespoon of bacon fat from the pan. (Do not discard bacon fat in your sink, it will clog the drain. Pour the fat into a jar and let it cool and solidify. Then either scoop it out and discard it or use it for another purpose.)\n3 Cook onion and celery in the bacon fat: Add the chopped onion and celery to the remaining bacon fat in the pot. Cook for 2 minutes on medium high, then lower the heat to low, and cover the pot. Let cook slowly on low heat for 15 to 20 minutes.\n4 Scoop out baked potatoes, add it and chicken stock to pot: When potatoes are cool enough to handle, scoop out the insides to a bowl. Then add it to the cooked onion and celery mixture along with 6 cups chicken stock. Add a teaspoon of kosher salt.\nBring the soup to a simmer and reduce the heat to low.\nUse a potato masher to mash the potatoes into the stock.\n5 Pur\xc3\xa9e some or all of the soup: Cook the potato soup for about 5 minutes, then use an immersion blender to pur\xc3\xa9e about half of the soup if you want a slightly chunky soup, or pur\xc3\xa9e all of it if you want a smoother soup.\n6 Add cream: Stir 2 to 4 tablespoons of heavy cream into the soup if you want a creamier soup. Add more salt and pepper to taste.\n7 Top with grated cheddar, sour cream, chives, bacon: Pour into bowls and top with grated cheddar, sour cream, chives, and crumbled crispy bacon.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nBrussels Sprouts with Bacon and Chestnuts Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 6-8 as a side\nChestnuts are delicious, but a major pain to roast and shell (have you ever exploded chestnuts all over your kitchen? I have). Canned (jarred more like it) chestnuts actually work better in recipes than the kind you roast and peel yourself. The texture and moisture content is more consistent. So, we suggest using canned roasted chestnuts for this recipe. You can of course roast and shell your own if you prefer.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Brussels sprouts\n1/3 pound thick-sliced bacon or slab bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces or batons\n1 red onion, chopped\n20-25 canned roasted chestnuts, quartered or roughly chopped\n1/4 cup chicken stock\nSalt and pepper to taste\nLemon wedges to serve\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the Brussels sprouts: Cut the Brussels sprouts in half and slice thinly, starting at the top of the sprout and working back toward the stem. Discard the hard tip of the stem side.\n2 Cook the bacon: Cut the bacon into pieces about 1/4 inch wide and put them in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium heat.\nWhen the bacon is browned, remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n3 Cook the onions in bacon fat, add back the bacon:  Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat (do not put down the drain, see how to render bacon fat). Turn up the heat to high, add the red onions. Cook until the onions begin to brown, add back the bacon.\n5 Add chestnuts, Brussels sprouts, stock: Add the chestnuts and Brussels sprouts to the saut\xc3\xa9 pan with the bacon and onions. Add the chicken stock and toss to combine. Stir in about 1 teaspoon of salt, more or less to taste. Cook over high heat for 3-4 minutes. Add pepper to taste.\nServe hot with lemon wedges.

Then poach the eggs while the pasta is cooking. It all comes together in about 20 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons white vinegar, for poaching the eggs\n12 ounces (3/4 box) spaghetti\n6 slices (about 5 ounces) thick cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch dice\n2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced\n7 to 8 (12 ounces) small (1 1/2-inch) tomatoes, quartered\n4 large eggs\n1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan\n1/2 cup packed basil leaves, torn into pieces\nFreshly ground black pepper, to taste\nOlive oil, for garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Bring two pans of water to a boil: For the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (at least 4 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of salt). For the eggs, fill a wide saucepan with 2 inches of salted water and bring to a boil. Add the vinegar to the saucepan for the eggs.\n2 Cook the bacon, garlic, and tomatoes while the water heats: In a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until browned. Transfer to plate.\nAdd the garlic and the tomatoes, and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes, or just until the garlic turns pale golden and the tomatoes soften slightly. Remove the pan from the heat.\n3 Cook the spaghetti: Add the spaghetti to the large pot of boiling water, and cook for 8 to 9 minutes, or until al dente. Remove 1 cup of the pasta water with a measuring cup.\n4 Poach the eggs while the pasta cooks: Line a tray or plate with a paper towel. Adjust the heat under the saucepan so that the poaching water barely simmers.\nCrack 1 egg into a small bowl or cup and, holding the rim as close to the surface of the water as possible, drop the egg into the water.\nRapidly repeat with the remaining eggs.\nDrag a wooden spoon around the edge of the pot to stir the water and gently release the eggs from the bottom.\nAfter 2 minutes, lift 1 egg from the water with a slotted spoon and test for doneness by pressing on the egg. The white should feel firm and the yolk should still be soft. Return to the water if necessary to complete the cooking. With a slotted spoon, transfer the eggs to the paper towel lined plate to drain the water.\n5 Assemble the pasta: Set the skillet with the garlic and tomatoes back over low heat. With tongs, add the cooked spaghetti. Add the cooked bacon, Parmesan, basil, salt, and pepper and toss together. If the spaghetti looks dry, add some of the reserved pasta water a few tablespoons at a time.\n6 To serve: Divide the spaghetti among 4 plates or shallow bowls and top each with a poached egg.

We added them because, why not? Tastes good. Also we halved the recipe, because for everyday meals we don't need to serve 10 to 12. Feel free to double to Ree's original Thanksgiving-worthy proportions.\nThis recipe also works well in the slow cooker, so I've added instructions for that as well.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 slices thick cut bacon (about 4 ounces), cut into 1-inch segments\n1/2 large onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)\n1 clove garlic, minced\n1 pounds of fresh, firm green beans (they should break when you bend them, not bend like a rubber band), stem ends trimmed\n1 14.5-ounce can whole tomatoes\n1 large sprig fresh thyme\nSalt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the bacon until fat begins to render: Place the bacon pieces on the bottom of a large, thick-bottomed pot. Heat on medium heat for several minutes until the bacon fat begins to render.\n2 Add onions, then garlic: Add the chopped onions to the bacon. Cook a few minutes until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic (if using) and cook a minute more. Drain off any excess fat.\n3 Add green beans, tomatoes, spices: Add the green beans to the pot. Add the whole, peeled, canned tomatoes and their juices. Add a sprig of thyme to the pot (if using). Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and cayenne.\n4 Cover and simmer: Cover the pot and lower the heat to low. Simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the beans are cooked through and tender, stirring occasionally.\nSlow Cooker Instructions If you want to use a slow cooker for step 4, you can easily do so. Just put the cooked bacon and onions from steps 1 and 2, and the beans, tomatoes and spices into a slow cooker and cook on high for 2 to 3 hours, depending on your slow cooker, until the beans are completely tender and the tomatoes have broken down.\nServe!\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHow to Render Bacon Fat\nCook time: 10 minutes\nIf you make more bacon fat than you end up using, just throw out the whole jar and start a new one.\nNever pour bacon fat down the drain! It will solidify as it cools and clog your drain. Either soak it up with paper towels and discard or pour the rendered bacon fat into a jar to save.\nINGREDIENTS\nStrips of raw bacon\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook bacon on medium low heat: Heat a large skillet on medium-low heat. Lay out several strips of raw bacon. Let the strips cook for 10 or 15 minutes, turning them occasionally.\nWhen the bacon strips are nicely browned and crispy, use tongs or a fork to lift them out of the pan and place them on paper towels (to absorb the excess fat) on a plate.\n2 Pour remaining fat into a jar: Pour the remaining fat in the pan into a jar, and put the jar into your refrigerator. The bacon grease will solidify to a slightly off-color white. When you cook bacon again, pull out the jar and add more of the excess fat to it.\nIf you want, you can strain out the solid bacon bits before pouring the fat into a jar. I find that these bits have plenty of flavor, so I don't bother to strain them.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

This helps make it easier to mix with the other ingredients.\nDepending on the size of your peppers and how much you stuff them, you may have some leftover filling. This makes a great spread for crackers or made into sandwiches! \nOven Directions: Arrange the poppers on a baking sheet and roast at 425F until the cheese filling is hot and bubbly and the jalape\xc3\xb1os are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the bacon:\n12 ounces (8 to 12 slices) thick-cut smoked bacon\n1 1/2 tablespoons barbecue sauce\nFor the filling:\n8 ounces plain cream cheese, softened to room temperature\n1 cup (about 3 ounces) coarsely shredded sharp cheddar cheese\n1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh chives\n1 large clove garlic, minced\n2 tablespoons barbecue sauce\n12 medium-sized jalape\xc3\xb1os\nExtra minced fresh chives to garnish\n1 cup sour cream, to serve (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xbaF. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Lay a few layers of paper towels on top of a cooling rack and place near the oven.\n2 Glaze and bake the bacon until crispy: Arrange the bacon in a single layer on the baking sheet. Brush with 1 1/2 tablespoons of barbecue sauce.\nTransfer to the oven and bake until crisp and caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes (begin checking around 15 minutes; the bacon could take up to 20 minutes to fully crisp depending on the brand and thickness).\nRemove the bacon from oven and drain for a few minutes on paper towels, then transfer to a plate to finish cooling. The pieces will stick to the paper towels if left for too long.\n3 While bacon cooks, prepare the filling: Combine cream cheese, cheddar cheese, chives, garlic and barbecue sauce in a small mixing bowl.\n4 Prepare the jalape\xc3\xb1o peppers: Wear gloves for this step if you are sensitive to pepper heat. Cut the jalape\xc3\xb1os in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. You can leave the stems on (they make nice handles for eating!) or trim them off.\nArrange all the jalape\xc3\xb1os cut-side up on a platter or baking sheet.\n5 Stuff the peppers: Chop or crumble the bacon into small bits, then fold into the cream cheese mixture. Using a spoon, fill each of the jalape\xc3\xb1o halves with a big dollop of the cream cheese mixture, mounding slightly.\nAt this point, the poppers can be covered and refrigerated until ready to grill, up to 24 hours.\n6 Prepare your grill: For gas grills, heat the grill with the burners set to high and preheat for 10 minutes. When ready to grill, reduce the burners to medium.\nFor charcoal grills, fill a grill chimney with charcoal and light it. When the coals are hot (they should be covered with a layer of fine gray ash) empty the coals into the grill and push them to one side of the grill to make higher heat and lower heat cooking zones. Set the grate in place and cover the grill. Preheat the grate for 5 minutes.\n7 Grill the poppers: Brush grill grates with oil to prevent sticking. If you're using a charcoal grill, cook over the low-heat cooking zone.\nUsing tongs, place the poppers on the grill so they lay across the grates and don't fall through. If any of the poppers is leaning to the side, prop it up against a neighbor so the cheese filling doesn't start to melt out as the poppers cook.\nGrill until the poppers are seared on the bottoms and the cheese filling is hot and bubbling around the edges, about 10 minutes. Be careful of overcooking or the peppers will become too soft.\n8 Serve the poppers right away: Using tongs and a spatula in tandem to scoop up the poppers, remove from the grill and transfer to a platter. Serve immediately alongside sour cream, if desired. Discard the stems as you eat.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nGrilled Bacon-Wrapped Stuffed Hot Dogs Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 11 minutesYield: Makes 4 stuffed hot dogs\nRecipe adapted from Mastering the Grill: The Owner's Manual for Outdoor Cooking by Andrew Schloss and David Joachim.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 teaspoon ketchup\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard\n4 large hot dogs, knockwurst, or kielbasa\n1/2 ounce cheddar cheese, cut into long sticks\n2 tablespoons chopped onions\n1 cup prepared sauerkraut, drained, roughly chopped\n4 slices bacon\nVegetable oil\n4 long hot dog buns\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare your grill for direct medium high heat.\n2 Slice open the hot dogs: Mix together the ketchup and mustard in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the sauerkraut with the chopped onion, set aside.\nSlice open the hot dogs, down the center, lengthwise, forming a deep pocket in each, but not cutting all the way through.\nCoat the inside of each hot dog with the mustard ketchup mixture.\n3 Stuff the hot dogs: Place a strip of cheese deep within the pocket of each hot dog. Top with sauerkraut and onions.\nEncapsulate the cheese at the ends with the sauerkraut mixture as well, so that no cheese is exposed (otherwise it will drip out when cooking).\n4 Wrap bacon around each hot dog: Wrap a strip of bacon around each stuffed hot dog, securing with toothpicks at each end.\nMake sure you wrap tight enough so that the stuffing stays in, but not so tight so that when the hot dog expands will cooking the bacon would tear.\n5 Grill the hot dogs: Brush the grates of your grill with vegetable oil so that the hot dogs don't stick. If you have a grill screen (a screen with smaller holes so that small pieces of whatever you're cooking don't fall through the grill), you can use it, just coat it with vegetable oil first and pre-heat for a couple of minutes.\nPlace the stuffed hot dogs on the grill, stuffing side down. Grill for 2 minutes, until the bacon on that side is cooked, turn the hot dogs a quarter turn and grill for a couple more minutes.\nContinue to grill for a few minutes each on all sides until the bacon is cooked. Cover the grill in between turnings to help with the cooking.\n6 Grill the buns: During the last minute of cooking, open up the hot dog buns and place them open-side down on the grill to lightly toast.\n7 Serve: Remove the hot dogs and buns from the grill. Remove the toothpicks from the hot dogs. Place the hot dogs in the buns and serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

(If you are using a stovetop pressure cooker, use medium heat.)\nLet the bacon cook until it has rendered some fat and begun to brown a bit, about 7 minutes. Add the onions and saut\xc3\xa9 until softened and translucent, about 3 more minutes.\n2 Stir in the rest of the ingredients and pressure cook: Add the green beans, diced tomatoes and their liquid, water, salt, pepper, cayenne, and thyme. Give everything a good stir so all of the green beans are coated with some of the cooking liquid.\nSecure the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure that the pressure regulator is set to the \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d position. Cancel the \xe2\x80\x9cSaut\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d program on the pressure cooker, then select the \xe2\x80\x9cManual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPressure Cook\xe2\x80\x9d setting.

b"Save It Print\nPasta with Butternut Squash, Bacon, and Brown Butter Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound butternut squash, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 4 cups)\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1 teaspoon Morton\xe2\x80\x99s kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper\n1 pound pasta, such as penne, rigatoni, or other short-shaped pasta\n8 ounces bacon (7 to 8 slices, depending on how thickly they are cut)\n1/4 cup sliced shallots\n1 stick unsalted butter (4 ounces/8 tablespoons)\n4 to 5 sage leaves\n1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Roast the squash: Preheat the oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. On a rimmed baking sheet, combine the squash with olive oil, salt, and pepper on a rimmed baking sheet, and toss to coat.\nRoast for 20 minutes, tossing half way through to evenly brown. When it\xe2\x80\x99s ready, the squash will be soft and some of the edges will have browned.\n2 Cook the pasta: Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook the pasta to al dente, or according to package directions. Drain well and set aside.\n3 Fry the bacon: In a large, deep skillet (I used cast iron), put the bacon in a cold pan and cook over medium heat until crispy. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.\n4 Cook the shallots: Place the skillet back on the stove, but with the heat turned off. Drain all but about 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease.\nAdd the shallots and cook in the residual heat from the skillet; this helps prevent the shallots from burning. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be cooking fast enough, turn the heat to medium-low and cook for just a couple of minutes until they start to soften and become aromatic. Transfer the cooked shallots to a large bowl.\n  5 Combine the bacon, shallots, squash and pasta: After the bacon cools, cut it into small pieces using kitchen scissors (or using a chef's knife), and combine with the shallots in a large bowl\xe2\x80\x94or you can use the stockpot you cooked the pasta in (I like to do this if it's just me and the boys).\nAdd the pasta and toss to combine. When the squash comes out of the oven, add the squash to this bowl and toss gently together.\n  6 Brown the butter: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir it constantly and keep an eye on it so it does not burn. (See here for full instructions on how to brown butter.) It will start to crackle, foam, and smell nutty. The color will deepen to a caramel/amber hue.\nAround when the butter stops foaming\xe2\x80\x94or at least it starts to subside\xe2\x80\x94and the butter turns slightly brown, add the sage leaves.\nRemove the saucepan from the heat as soon as the sage leaves start to curl. Pour the butter and the sage leaves into the bowl with the rest of the ingredients.\n  7 Combine all ingredients and serve: Toss everything gently together with a wooden spoon. Taste and add salt and/or pepper if needed. Serve immediately with freshly grated cheese over the top.\nIf you are feeling extra decadent, add a chunk of unsalted butter or a splash of extra virgin olive oil on top when you toss, or some of the reserved bacon grease.\nLeftovers keep for about 2 to 3 days and reheat fairly well. I like to add a bit of olive oil or water to the pot when I reheat it over low heat. (I try to avoid microwaving leftover pasta because it just makes it gummy.)\nHello!

If you boil or steam the corn ears after you've already husked them, or if you cook them in the microwave, reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.\n2 Remove the corn kernels from the cobs: To remove the kernels from the cobs, stand a corn cob vertically with the tip on a small bowl that is inverted inside a larger, shallow bowl.\nUse a sharp knife to make long, downward strokes, removing the kernels from the cob, as you work your way around the cob.\nNote: it may help to work over a low table, to be in a better ergonomic position to cut the cobs this way.\n3 Make the dressing: In a separate bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, and cumin.\n4 Assemble the salad: In a medium sized bowl, mix together the corn, chopped arugula, bacon, and onions.\nMix dressing into salad just before serving.

I\'ve brought back the bacon gremolata yet again because it pairs so nicely with the roasted cabbage. I hope you and your guests find as much joy and pleasure in this simple recipe as we do."\nAdapted from Dishing Up the Dirt by Andrea Bemis, copyright \xc2\xa9 2017. Published by Harper Wave, an imprint of Harper Collins Publishers.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the cabbage:\n1 medium-sized head of cabbage (about 1 1/2 pounds)\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\nFor the bacon gremolata:\n3/4 cup roasted unsalted almonds\n4 strips (about 1/4 pound) good-quality thick-cut bacon\n3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley\n1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest\nPinch of kosher salt\nTo serve:\nFreshly grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the oven to 400F. Arrange two oven racks in the upper and lower third of the oven.\n2 Slice the cabbage: Peel off one or two of the thin, limp outer layers of the cabbage. Trim the stem so that it is flush with the bottom of the cabbage (if it isn\'t already).\nSet the cabbage upright and slice into 1-inch thick slices. Don\'t worry if a few of the outer layers unfurl or fall away.\n3 Brush the cabbage slices with olive oil: Use a pastry brush to cover both sides of the cabbage slices with olive oil, or use your fingers to rub the oil in. Season both sides with a little salt and pepper.\n4 Roast the cabbage: Arrange the cabbage slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast on the lower oven rack for 35 to 45 minutes, flipping the slices halfway through cooking.\nWhen done, both sides should be seared an even golden-brown with crispy edges and the center of the slices should be tender.\n5 While the cabbage is roasting, prepare the bacon gremolata. If using unroasted almonds, arrange them on another sheet pan and roast in the upper part of the oven for about 10 minutes, until toasted and fragrant. Remove from the oven, cool briefly, then finely chop using a chef\'s knife (or pulse a few times in a food processor, but be careful not to over process or you\'ll make almond butter!)\nCook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until very crispy. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. When cool, roughly chop.\nCombine the chopped almonds, chopped bacon, minced parsley, lemon zest, and a pinch of kosher salt in a small mixing bowl. Toss to combine and set aside. (This bacon gremolata can be prepared ahead and kept refrigerated in an airtight container for about a week.)\n6 To serve: As soon as the cabbage slices are done roasting, transfer to a serving platter or individual plates. Sprinkle with a few spoonfuls of bacon gremolata and grated Parmesan cheese. Serve warm.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Lay the strips of bacon in a single layer on the pan. Slowly cook the bacon, rendering out the fat, until lightly browned on one side. Using a fork or tongs, turn the strips of bacon over to cook the other side.\nWhen the bacon strips are sufficiently cooked remove from pan and place on a plate lined with a paper towel to absorb the excess fat.\nPour out excess fat from the pan (leaving about half a teaspoon in the pan) into a jar or a container to either dispose of or to store. (Never pour bacon grease down the sink, it will clog your pipes.)\n2 Wilt the arugula: In the same pan, add handfuls of fresh baby arugula or watercress. Toss in the remaining remaining fat. As soon as the greens start to wilt, remove from heat and remove from the pan to stop the cooking.\n3 Toast bread, build sandwich: Toast bread slices in a toaster. Spread mayonnaise (or your favorite spread, butter will do too) over the slices. Layer the sandwich with bacon, sliced tomato, and lightly wilted arugula. Cut on the diagonal.\nEat immediately.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

Just cut into thick rounds, coat with olive oil, and grill for about 5 minutes per side. Then chop.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/4 pound thick cut bacon\n1/2 large red onion, chopped, about 1 cup\n2 cups finely chopped fresh pineapple (about 10 oz)\n1/4 cup chopped sweet pickles\n1 Tbsp sweet pickle juice\n8 hot dogs\n8 hot dog buns\nMETHOD\n1 Pre-cook the bacon: Place the strips of bacon in a skillet on medium heat. Slowly cook the bacon, turning the strips over occasionally until much of the fat is rendered and the bacon is lightly browned. Remove the bacon strips to a paper towel lined plate.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions: Pour off all but a teaspoon of the bacon fat (do this into a jar, do not pour down the drain or you will clog your pipes). Increase the heat to medium high and add the chopped onion. Cook, stirring occasionally until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.\nWhile the onions are cooking, finely chop the cooled bacon strips.\n3 Make pineapple bacon relish: In a large bowl stir to combine the bacon, onion, pineapple, and sweet pickles. Mix in a tablespoon of sweet pickle juice. You can make ahead at this point, chill until ready to serve with the hot dogs.\n4 Cook the hot dogs: Heat the hot dogs your favorite way. The hot dogs are already cooked when you buy them, so all you really need to do is heat them through.\nOver a grill, grill for about 5 minutes on a medium flame, until lightly browned, and toast the buns for a minute if you wish.\nOr, put the dogs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 5 minutes.\nOr, pierce the hot dogs all over with a fork and put on a plate in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds per hot dog.\n5 Assemble: Place a hot dog in a bun and top with a couple spoonfuls of relish.\nHello!

Turn the heat to medium and cook, turning frequently, until the bacon is crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Lay on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. When the bacon is cool enough to handle, crumble it and set it aside.\n2 Scoop and mash the avocados: Cut the avocados in half pole-to-pole and twist them open. Remove the pit. (See How to Cut and Peel and Avocado.) With a large spoon, scoop the avocado flesh into a medium bowl. Mash it with a large fork until it\xe2\x80\x99s chunky-smooth.\n3 Add the seasonings: Add 2 teaspoons vinegar, the garlic powder, and the hot pepper sauce; mix well.

b"Save It Print\nOven-Baked Bacon\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: 12 strips\nIf you use thick-cut bacon, plan to cook for an extra 5 to 10 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\n12 strips bacon\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\nWire baking rack\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the bacon: If you have an oven-safe baking rack, place it inside a sheet pan. (For even easier clean-up, you can also line the sheet pan with foil.)\nLay out the bacon strips on the wire rack. Make sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t overlap. Sprinkle bacon strips with black pepper, if you want.\n2 Bake the bacon: Place the bacon in a cold oven, and set the oven temperature to 375\xc2\xb0F. Bake the bacon in the oven for 15-20 minutes total.\nIf you are doing more than one pan of bacon, rotate sheet pans from top to bottom halfway through. If you are not using a baking rack, flip the bacon strips halfway through cooking.\nStart checking the bacon around 18 minutes, as some bacon cooks faster depending on the fat content. The bacon is done when it turns a dark tan color. Remember that the bacon crisps up as it cools, so don't worry if it's not completely crispy when you take it out of the oven.\n3 Drain and cool: When the bacon comes out of the oven, place it on a few paper towels to drain and cool. If you like, pour off the bacon grease from the pan and save it for cooking. (I love to cook eggs in my bacon grease!)\n4 Store the bacon: Bacon can be kept in the fridge for a few days and reheats well in a skillet over low heat. You can also freeze the bacon if you made a big batch. Just make sure to freeze the strips individually, or in between pieces of parchment paper, so they don't stick together.\nHello!

b"Print\nHow to Make Candied Bacon\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: 12 strips, serves 4 to 6\nThis recipe is easily doubled. Space the bacon as closely together as you can on the two baking sheets. It's okay if they touch in places, but don't let them overlap.\nMAPLE BACON ALTERNATIVE: As an alternative to the standard recipe, stir two tablespoons of maple syrup into the brown sugar and brush this onto the bacon before baking. Bake just as you would the normal version.\nINGREDIENTS\n12 strips bacon (not thick-cut, about one pound)\n1/4 cup light brown sugar\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\n2 baking sheets\n2 oven-safe wire racks\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the bacon: Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xb0 F with one rack in the top third and another rack in the bottom third of the oven. Line two baking sheets with foil, and place an oven-safe wire rack on each. Lay out the bacon strips perpendicular to the lines on the wire rack, divided between the two pans and making sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t overlap. (If you lay them out parallel to the rack, the bacon may fall through the cracks while cooking!)\nSprinkle the bacon strips with brown sugar and (optionally) add some freshly ground black pepper. I like to use about 1 teaspoon of brown sugar per bacon strip, spreading it out along the length of the strip.\n2 Bake the candied bacon: Bake the bacon in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. I recommend rotating the pans once during baking to ensure the bacon is cooking evenly. Start checking the bacon around 18 minutes, as some slices will cook faster, depending on the fat content and thickness of the slices.\nThe bacon is done when the brown sugar is melted and the bacon is a deep brown color. Remember that the bacon will continue to crisp up as it cools, so don\xe2\x80\x99t worry if it\xe2\x80\x99s not completely crispy now.\n3 Cool the bacon: Let the bacon cool right on the wire rack for a few minutes. (If you eat it right away, you'll burn your mouth on the molten sugar.) The bacon will crisp up as it cools and as the melted sugar hardens. Then serve!\n4 Store the bacon: Candied bacon can be kept in the fridge for a few days and reheats well in a skillet over low heat.\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think candied bacon is worth freezing, although if you made a huge batch you absolutely could. You could just want to make sure to freeze the strips individually so they didn\xe2\x80\x99t stick together.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Let them sit for 20 minutes to reconstitute. Drain the figs and cut off the stems. Cut a small slit in each fig and spoon in a little blue cheese or goat cheese, or half an almond, if desired. You could also do a mix of fillings.\n2 Wrap the bacon around the figs: Cut the strips of bacon in half and trim them down to about 1/2 to 3/4 inches wide. Wrap one bacon strip around each fig. Secure with a toothpick.\n3 Air fry the figs: Spray the basket of your air fryer with nonstick spray. Add bacon-wrapped figs in a single layer so they aren\xe2\x80\x99t touching. Air fry the figs at 350\xcb\x9aF for 8-9 minutes, flipping once halfway through.\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have an air fryer, broil the figs on high for about 3 minutes per side.\n4 Serve the figs: Once the figs have cooled slightly, serve them drizzled with honey.\nLeftover figs (yeah right!) will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.

Make a good-sized divot in the mushrooms, but make sure to leave enough mushroom around the edges to hold the filling. Finely dice the stems and cored bits.\n3 Cook the bacon: Meanwhile, add bacon to a medium or large skillet over medium heat. Cook until bacon is browned and crispy, about 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the cooked bacon, leaving the grease, and chop into tiny bits.\n4 Cook the filling ingredients: Add the chopped mushroom cores, diced onions, and thyme to the skillet with the reserved bacon grease. Saut\xc3\xa9 the filling ingredients over medium heat until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in breadcrumbs and chopped bacon. Let cool.\n5 Add the gouda: After mixture has cooled slightly, stir in the grated gouda cheese.\n6 Stuff the mushrooms: Line up the cored mushrooms in a baking dish that has been lightly oiled to prevent sticking. Spoon about 2 heaping tablespoons of the filling into each mushroom, piling it high and packing it in. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if the mushrooms are almost overflowing. You should use all the filling!\n7 Bake the mushrooms: Bake the stuffed mushrooms for 20 minutes at 400\xcb\x9aF.

Toast croutons in a nonstick skillet over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if the char on them becomes uneven. Some sides should be crunchy and some soft still. Remove and set aside.\n2 Cook the bacon: Add chopped bacon to a large pot over medium heat. Cook until fat renders out and bacon is crispy. Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with a paper towel and set aside as a topping for the soup. Reserve the bacon grease in the pot.\n3 Make the soup: Add onions, celery, carrots, and parsnips to pot. Season with salt and pepper and cook until vegetables soften, 3 to 4 minutes.\nStir in flour, cook for another minute, then add broth and milk. Slowly stir. Bring to a slight simmer, then add potatoes and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until potatoes are very tender.\n4 Blend half of the soup: When potatoes are very tender, remove half of the soup from the pot and let cool briefly. Blend until smooth and return to the pot, stirring it into the non-blended soup base.\nAlternatively, blend half the soup directly in the pot with an immersion blender; be careful not to over-blend! Some chunks are good. Taste the soup and adjust seasoning to your liking. Keep warm until serving.\n5 Serve: Serve the soup topped with fresh chives, crispy reserved bacon, and skillet croutons.\nLeftover soup keeps well in the fridge for up to a week, or you can freeze it for 3 months.

b'Save It Print\nLoaded Baked Potatoes Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4-6\nINGREDIENTS\n6-8 strips bacon\n6 medium-large russet potatoes, scrubbed well\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 pound fresh broccoli, cut into florets (or use frozen)\n8 ounces grated sharp cheddar cheese\nTo serve:\nSour cream\nFresh chives\nDad Add: Quick Home Fries (serves 2):\n1 baked potato, diced\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt\nEggs, for serving\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the bacon: Line a baking sheet with foil, then top with a wire baking rack (cookie cooling rack). Lay the bacon strips on the wire rack perpendicular to the wires, making sure the bacon pieces don\xe2\x80\x99t overlap.\n2 Bake the bacon and scrub the potatoes: Place the bacon in a cold oven and set the temperature to 375\xc2\xb0F. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Check the bacon around the 18-minute mark. Some types of bacon cook faster than others. (See How to Make Bacon in the Oven for full details.)\nWhile the bacon bakes, scrub potatoes well and then stab each potato about 10 times with a fork to prevent the possibility of a potato exploding in the oven. (It can happen!)\nRemove the bacon from the oven; transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\n3 Bake the potatoes: Increase the heat to 400\xcb\x9aF. Place potatoes on a baking sheet, drizzle well with olive oil, and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake potatoes for about an hour until the skins are shriveled slightly and the potatoes are very tender. (See How to Bake a Potato for more details.)\n4 Blanch the broccoli: While the potatoes bake, cook your broccoli. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a big pinch of salt to the water to season it. Add broccoli to the water and boil for 3 minutes until the broccoli is just tender, but not mushy at all.\nDrain broccoli once it is tender and set aside for assembly. We will warm everything up once the potatoes are assembled at the end.\n5 Open the potatoes: Once your potatoes are baked, let them cool slightly so you can handle them. Cut each potato down the center, being careful not to cut all the way through. Then cut two perpendicular cuts near the end of each potato; this will allow you to open each potato up easier. I like to use a small paring knife to slice up the interior of the potato, making it easier to unfold and stuff.\n5 Stuff the potatoes: Sprinkle some cheese over the potato. I like a lot of cheese, but feel free to use as much or as little as you\xe2\x80\x99d like. Top with about 1/2 cup of cooked broccoli and 1 piece of crumbled bacon. Sprinkle the broccoli with more cheese and more broccoli or bacon depending on the size of the potato and the size of your appetite!\n6 Reheat the potatoes: Place the stuffed potato back in the oven for 5-10 minutes to really melt the cheese and warm the fillings.\n7 Serve: Top the warm potatoes with sour cream and chives and serve.\nLeftovers: Store any extra potatoes before filling them. Leftover potatoes can be used within a week for baked potatoes, loaded potatoes, or quick Dad Add home fries!\n8 How to Make Dad Add Home Fries: Cut a leftover potato into about 1/4-inch cubes. Into a medium skillet set over medium heat, add the olive oil. When the oil starts to shimmer, add the potato cubes and seasoned salt. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are crispy and browned on the edges. Remove from skillet and serve with eggs.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Use a hand mixer or a stand mixer to whip the goat cheese mixture until it has a smooth, light consistency. (If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a hand mixer or stand mixer, you can use a fork to mash the ingredients together, but they won't have the same whipped consistency.)\nThe finished dip should be easily spreadable with a knife. If it is too thick or seems dry, add more milk by the tablespoon.\n2 Assemble the dip: Spread the whipped goat cheese in a thin, even layer along the bottom of a 2 1/2-quart baking dish or an 8x8 baking dish. It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more than 1/2-inch thick in any part of the dip.

If they don't taste good raw, believe me, they aren't going to taste good cooked.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 cups of peeled, sliced apples - use apples that cook up well, like Fuji or Jonagold\n3 Tbsp sugar\nA sprinkle of cinnamon\n1 Tbsp maple syrup\nMETHOD\n1 Sprinkle apples with cinnamon and sugar: Put apple slices in a glass bowl. Sprinkle on top the 3 Tbsp of sugar. Add a light sprinkle of cinnamon.\n2 Microwave on high for 5 minutes or more: Bake in microwave oven for 5 minutes on high heat. Adjust the time for your microwave and how many apples you are doing. Ours has a powerful high setting so 4 cups of apples only takes 5 minutes.\nIf you use more apples, you will probably need to cook it a little longer. I suggest starting with 5 minutes and testing for doneness with a fork. If it needs more cooking time, give it more.\n3 Add maple syrup to taste: When done, remove and mix so the sugar coats well all the apple pieces.

You don't have to (see this great Russ Parsons article in the LA Times about why you don't need to soak beans), but not doing so in this recipe will increase the cooking time. With the beans pre-soaked, they'll still take 8 hours to cook and soften in a slow-cooker. Once beans come in contact with the molasses, the sugar in the molasses will keep the beans firm. That's why they take so long to cook.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound (2 to 2 1/4 cups) dry white beans such as Navy beans or Great Northern beans (can also use kidney beans)\n1/3 cup molasses\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n3-4 Tbsp Dijon mustard\n1/8 teaspoon ground cloves\n3 cups hot water\n1/2 pound salt pork (can sub bacon), cut into 1/2-inch to 1-inch pieces\n1 medium onion, (1 1/2 cups) chopped\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Soak beans in water: Place beans in a large pot and cover with 2 inches of water. Soak overnight and drain. Alternatively, bring a pot with the beans covered with 2 inches of water to a boil, remove from heat and let soak for a hour, then drain.\n2 Mix molasses, brown sugar, mustard, ground cloves with water: Whisk together the molasses, brown sugar, mustard, and ground cloves with 3 cups of hot water.\n3 Add ingredients to slow-cooker, layering them, starting with the salt pork: Line the bottom of a slow-cooker (or a Dutch oven if you are cooking in the oven) with half of the salt pork (pick the fattiest pieces). Layer over with half of the drained beans. Add all of the chopped onion in a layer.\nTop with another layer of beans and the remaining salt pork. Pour the molasses water mixture over the beans to just cover the beans.\n4 Slow cook until beans are tender: Cover and cook in a slow-cooker on the low setting for 8 hours (or in a 250\xc2\xb0F oven), until the beans are tender. Check the water level a few hours in, and if the beans need more water, add some. Add additional salt to taste if needed.\nNote that fresher beans will cook faster than older beans. Your beans may be ready in less than 8 hours, or they may take longer. Best the next day.\nServe with Boston brown bread.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Bring to a simmer, cover, reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook until the beans are just soft enough to eat, about 1 hour, give or take 15 minutes or so, depending on how old the beans are (older beans will take longer to cook).\n3 Cook bacon or pancetta: Preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xb0F. In a 3 or 4 quart heavy-bottomed, oven-proof, lidded pot such as a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until lightly browned and crispy.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions: Add the chopped onions and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring often, until the onions begin to brown. Use a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits off the bottom of the pot.\n5 Add garlic, chili flakes, sage, then add tomatoes and stock: Add the garlic, chile flakes and sage and cook for 1-2 minutes, then add the honey and tomato paste. Stir well to combine.\nAdd the tomatoes or tomato sauce and the stock. Bring to a simmer. Taste for salt and add some if needed.\n6 Add the beans, cover, cook in oven: Drain the beans and add them to the pot. Stir well.\nCover the pot and cook in a 325\xc2\xb0F oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes.\nIf still a bit wet, remove the cover and cook for 15 minutes more.\nNote that the cooking time will depend on several things, the most important being how thoroughly the beans were cooked to begin with when they were simmered.\nIf the beans are still a bit hard when they go in the oven, it may take several hours to soften them, once the tomato and honey have been added.\n7 Stir in parsley and balsamic vinegar: Right before serving, gently stir in the chopped parsley and balsamic vinegar. Taste for salt, add more if needed to taste.\nServe either hot or at room temperature.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nPressure Cooker Baked Beans Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCooking (including pressure release) time: 2 hoursYield: 8 to 10 servings\nThis recipe uses an electric pressure cooker. Pressure cooking times will be slightly less if you\'re using a stovetop pressure cooker.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound dried Great Northern beans\n1/3 cup molasses\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n3 tablespoons Dijon mustard\n1/8 teaspoon ground cloves\n8 ounces bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 medium onion, diced\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart electric pressure cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Par-cook the beans: Combine the dried beans and 8 cups of the water in an electric pressure cooker. Secure the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure that the pressure regulator is set to the \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d position.\nIf you are using an Instant Pot, select the \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, then adjust the time to 15 minutes. If your pressure does not have a \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, set it manually to \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Pressure\xe2\x80\x9d for 15 minutes.\nIt will take about 20 minutes for your pressure cooker to come up to pressure, and then the 15 minutes of actual cooking will begin. \n2 Naturally release the pressure and drain the beans: When the timer goes off, wait for the pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes, then release the rest of the pressure by moving the pressure release knob from \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cVenting.\xe2\x80\x9d It will take a minute or two for the pressure to release completely.\nAt this point, the beans should be mostly cooked through, but still firm. It\'s fine if there\'s still a little bit of white at the center. If you\'d like to use some of the bean cooking liquid to make your baked beans, scoop out 1 1/2 cups of liquid and set it aside.\nWearing a pair of heat-proof mitts, lift the inner pot out of the pressure cooker and drain the beans into a colander in the sink. Wash out the pot and return it to the pressure cooker.\n3 Prepare the cooking liquid: In a small bowl, whisk together the molasses, sugar, mustard, ground cloves, and 1 1/2 cups water or reserved bean cooking liquid. Set aside.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 the bacon and onions: Reset the electric pressure cooker, then select its \xe2\x80\x9cSaut\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d program. Add the bacon to the pot and saut\xc3\xa9 it until it begins to render some fat, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the onions and saut\xc3\xa9 until they are translucent, about 5 more minutes. When done, hit "Cancel" to stop saut\xc3\xa9ing.\n5 Finish cooking the beans: Gently stir the beans and the cooking liquid into the pot with the bacon and onions. Secure the lid on the pressure cooker, again making sure that the pressure regulator is set to the \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d position.\nIf you are using an Instant Pot, select the \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, then adjust the time to 15 minutes. If your pressure does not have a \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, set it manually to \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Pressure\xe2\x80\x9d for 15 minutes.\nIt will take about 15 minutes for your pressure cooker to come up to pressure, and then the 15 minutes of actual cooking will begin.\n6 Let the pressure release naturally: When the cooking program finishes, let the pressure cooker completely release its pressure naturally. This will take about 30 minutes.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t perform a quick release, as the thick cooking liquid will sputter out of the pressure release valve.\n7 Serve the beans warm: They are very good straight out of the pot, and taste even better the next day. Reheat beans over low temperature on the stovetop, in a low oven, or in the microwave.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nKale Salad with Balsamic Dressing Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesRest in dressing time: 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nSlightly adapted from a Dan Barber recipe that appeared in Bon Appetit in 2009.\nFeel free to sub out the pine nuts with toasted slivered almonds, and the dried sweetened cranberries with golden raisins. We use both interchangeably in this salad.\nIf you are using regular kale instead of dinosaur kale, you might want to let the salad marinate a bit longer, two hours or more, before serving.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/4 cup dried sweetened cranberries, chopped (or whole golden raisins or currants)\n1/3 cup pine nuts (can substitute slivered almonds)\n1 pound fresh Lacinato kale (also called Tuscan kale or dinosaur kale), about 2-3 bunches, rinsed and patted dry\n1/4 cup balsamic vinegar\n3 tablespoons olive oil\n1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar\n1 tablespoon honey\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, packed\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toast the pine nuts: Heat a small skillet on medium high heat. Spread the pine nuts in an even layer on the bottom of the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Then remove to a bowl to allow to cool.\nHint when toasting nuts: do not take your eyes off of them! Nuts can go from browned to burned very quickly.\n2 Prep the kale: Use a sharp knife to cut out the tough midrib of each kale leaf, and discard or compost. Slice the leaves crosswise into thin, 1/4 inch wide, slices.\nThe easiest way to do this is to work with a small bunch of leaves at a time, stack the leaves and roll them into a loose cigar shape. Then using a sharp knife, work from one end of the "cigar" to the other, slicing a 1/4 inch off from the end.\nPlace the kale slices into a large bowl.\n3 Make the dressing: In a smaller bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, rice vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper.\n4 Dress the kale and toss with nuts and cranberries: A half hour to an hour or two before serving, toss the kale together with the toasted pine nuts, the dried cranberries, and the dressing, allowing the kale to marinate a bit.\n5 Right before serving, stir in the grated Parmesan cheese.\nHello!

They are delicate-tasting birds and need this delicate treatment to truly shine. If you are aiming for a temperature, 150\xc2\xb0F in either the leg or breast is ideal; quail are so small the whole bird will likely be the same temperature throughout.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 whole quail\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\nSalt\n1 celery stick\n1/2 cup chicken stock\n1/2 cup inexpensive balsamic vinegar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Defrost frozen quail: If you are working with frozen quail, either defrost overnight in the refrigerator, or place the package in a large bowl and cover with a couple inches of room temperature water for 20 minutes.\n2 Truss the quail: Pre-heat the oven to 500\xc2\xb0F. Truss the quail with kitchen string. Cut off a length of string about 18 inches long. Cross the middle of the string over the quail's legs and bring the string around to the front of the bird, making sure it holds the wings close to the bird's flanks. Tie the string tightly around the neck.\n(Chowhound has an excellent video on how to truss a chicken, and quail are the same, only smaller.)\nAllow the quail to come to room temperature for at least 20 minutes.\n3 Arrange quail in roasting pan: Pat the quail dry with paper towels. Coat the quail with the olive oil and salt well. When the oven is hot, arrange the quail, breast side up, in a small roasting pan. Use pieces of the celery stick to keep the birds upright while they roast.\n4 Roast quail: Roast quail for 10-12 minutes in a 500\xc2\xb0F oven. Remove the birds from the pan and set aside on a plate to rest for 10 minutes, loosely tented with foil.\n5 Make balsamic reduction: As the quail are resting, make the sauce by putting the roasting pan on a burner set to medium heat.

Keep the stock warm while making the risotto.\n2 Cook shallots and garlic: Melt a tablespoon of butter in a wide saucepan on medium heat. Add the chopped shallots and cook until translucent, a couple of minutes.\nAdd the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, a half minute more.\n3 Lightly brown the rice: Add the risotto rice to the pan and toss to coat with the shallots. Increase the heat to medium high and let the rice start to brown.\n4 Add the white wine: Stir in the white wine. The pan will steam up. Let the rice absorb the wine.\n5 Start adding the stock, 1/2 cup at a time: Here is the real process of making risotto. Add the stock, a half cup or ladleful at a time, slowly stirring the rice, and allowing the rice to absorb the stock for a minute or two, before adding another ladleful of stock.\nYou\'ll want to stop adding the stock when the rice is cooked through, but still a little firm to the bite, "al dente". Note that you may not need all of the stock you have heated for this recipe.\n6 Add balsamic, tomatoes, thyme with last 1/2 cup of stock: When it comes time for that last 1/2 cup of stock to add to the risotto, add it, as well as the balsamic vinegar. Balsamic vinegar can vary in its acidity and intensity. So, add 1 tablespoon to start, and add another tablespoon if you want more of the balsamic flavor.\nAdd half of the cherry tomatoes and add the thyme. Let the tomatoes soften with the cooking of the risotto in those last few minutes.\n7 Remove from heat, stir in Parm: When the risotto has reached it\'s "al dente" stage, remove it from heat. Stir in the shredded Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle with pepper.\n8 Serve: Serve with remaining halved fresh cherry tomatoes and thinly sliced basil on top.\n  Hello!

Pour the marinade over the steaks, turning them to coat the steaks on all sides. Close the bag or container, pushing as much air out as possible. Refrigerate and marinate the steaks for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.\n3 Heat your broiler: Preheat your oven broiler to 550\xc2\xbaF (or as high as your broiler goes) with the oven rack in its highest position (about 4 to 6 inches from the broiler element), and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\n4 Dry the steaks: Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and place them on the lined baking sheet. Patting the steaks dry is very important\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t want a bunch of extra marinade on the steaks and the sheet pan, as it will just burn under the broiler.\n5 Broil the steaks: Broil the steaks for 4 minutes on the first side, then use a pair of tongs to flip them and broil for 4 minutes more on the second side. Use a digital thermometer to test for doneness.\nI aim for around 130\xc2\xbaF in the center for medium-rare to medium steaks\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to cook a bit after you take them out of the oven. If the steaks are not yet done, flip and broil for an additional minute, and test again. (I usually end up broiling my steaks for 4 to 6 minutes per side, depending on their thickness.)\nIf the steaks are already charred after 4 minutes per side, but still undercooked in the middle, lower the oven rack a rung for the remainder of cooking, or even just turn the oven off and use the carryover heat to finish cooking the steaks for another minute or two.\n6 Rest and Serve: Transfer the steaks to a cutting board.

Add the garlic and rosemary and saut\xc3\xa9 1 minute more, until the garlic is no longer raw. Add the beef broth and balsamic vinegar, then use a wooden spoon to nudge any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.\n4 Pressure cook the roast: Use the tongs to lower the pot roast back into the pot, and spoon some of the cooking liquid over the top of the roast.\nSecure the lid on your pressure cooker in its Sealing position. Cancel the Saut\xc3\xa9 program, then select the Manual or Pressure Cook program for 55 minutes at high pressure. (It will take about 5 minutes for the pot to come up to pressure before the cooking program begins.)\n5 Release the pressure: When the cooking program ends, let the pressure release naturally for at least 15 minutes, then move the pressure release valve from to Venting to release any remaining steam. \nYou can also leave the pot roast on the Keep Warm setting for up to 10 hours. You do not need to vent the steam.\n6 Rest the pot roast: Open the pot and use the tongs to transfer the roast to a cutting board. Cover the roast with aluminum foil to keep it warm.\n7 Strain the cooking liquid: Set a strainer over a fat separator in the sink. Wearing heat-resistant mitts, lift the inner pot out of the pressure cooker housing and pour the cooking liquid through the strainer and into the fat separator. (If you don't have a fat separator, you can pour the liquid into a ziplock bag, tilt it, let the fat rise to the top. Then, cut a hole in the bottom corner of the bag to let the liquid strain out, stopping before you get to the fat.)\nDiscard the rosemary stems, then add the strained onions, garlic, and rosemary leaves back to pot. Pour the liquid from fat separator back into the pot as well. Discard the fat.\n8 Pressure cook the vegetables: Add the potatoes and carrots to the pot and place it back in its housing. Secure the lid in its Sealing position.\nCancel the cooking program, then select the Manual or Pressure Cook program for 5 minutes at high pressure. (It will take about 15 minutes for the pot to come up to pressure before the cooking program begins.)\n9 Release the pressure: When the cooking program ends, perform a quick pressure release by moving the pressure release valve to Venting to release the steam.\n10 Serve: Open the pot, then use a slotted spoon to transfer vegetables to serving dish. Taste the cooking liquid for seasoning, adding salt and/or pepper if needed.\nRemove any string from the pot roast, then carve it into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange the pot roast on the serving plate with the vegetables. Ladle some of the cooking liquid over the meat and vegetables, garnish with parsley (if using), and serve.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nChocolate Banana Bread Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Makes one 9x5-inch loaf\nUse very ripe or over-ripe bananas. The peels should be at least half browned, and the bananas inside squishy and browning.\nDo not use Dutch processed cocoa for this recipe, only natural unsweetened.\nMelted coconut oil can be used in place of the butter. The flavor will change a little and you may get a hint of coconut in the result.\nThere is only 1 egg and 1 teaspoon of baking soda in this recipe for leavening, so make sure your baking soda is still good! (See more info on baking soda and baking powder.)\nINGREDIENTS\n3 large ripe bananas (easily mashable)\n1/3 cup melted butter\n3/4 cup brown sugar (packed, light or dark)\n1 teaspoon salt (1/2 a teaspoon if using salted butter)\n1 large egg, beaten\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 1/4 cup all purpose flour\n1/4 cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\n1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips\nSpecial equipment:\n1 5x9-inch loaf pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare pan and preheat oven:  Butter or spray with cooking spray the inside of a 5x9-inch loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) with a rack in the middle.\n2 Pur\xc3\xa9e bananas: Using a blender, food processor, or a fork, pur\xc3\xa9e the peeled ripe bananas until smooth. You should have 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups of banana pur\xc3\xa9e.\n3 Mix wet ingredients and sugar: Place the banana pur\xc3\xa9e into a large mixing bowl. Stir the melted butter. Stir in the brown sugar and salt. Whisk to break up any clumps of brown sugar. Stir in the beaten egg and vanilla extract.\n4 Mix dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and allspice.\n5 Add the flour mixture to the banana mixture and stir until just incorporated.\nStir in the chocolate chips.\n6 Bake: Pour batter into a buttered loaf pan. Place in a 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) oven and bake for 1 hour.\nNote that because of the chocolate chips that melt in the bread as it cooks, it's hard to check for doneness using a tester that you insert.\nOne way to test is to gently push the center top of the chocolate banana bread down with your finger. If it feels relatively firm and bounces back when you release your finger, that's a good sign that it's done.\n7 Let cool: Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes in the pan.\nGently remove the loaf from the pan and place on a rack to cool completely.\nSlice with a serrated bread knife to serve.\nHello!

If so, apply sparingly so there is enough to cover the entire cake.\nFeel free to use any favorite liquor, such as Grand Marnier, Triple Sec, Cognac, Armagnac, Brandy or even Bourbon. Or, simply omit the liquor and use 2 tsp vanilla extract.\n  INGREDIENTS\nFor the cake:\n3 cups all-purpose flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder (make sure your baking powder is still fresh!)\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)\n3 large eggs\n2 cups granulated white sugar\n1 cup canola oil\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, with juice\n2 cups mashed bananas (from 3 to 5 bananas)\n1 cup finely chopped pecans\nFor the cream cheese frosting:\n1 pound cream cheese, softened\n1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened\n2 pounds (32-ounces) powdered sugar\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon Cointreau or other liquor (see Recipe Note)\n1 cup roughly chopped pecans, for topping (optional, toasted)\nEdible flowers for garnish (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\n3 9-inch cake pans\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0 F. Butter and flour three 9-inch round cake pans.\n2 Whisk together dry ingredients: In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg (optional).\n3 Whisk together oil, sugar, eggs, then stir in pineapple, bananas, vanilla, 1 cup of pecans: In a separate bowl, whisk the canola oil, sugar, and eggs together until combined. Stir the pineapple, bananas, vanilla and one cup of the chopped pecans into the egg mixture and mix (do not beat).\n4 Fold wet ingredients into dry: Using a wooden spoon or spatula, fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined (do not over-mix).\n5 Pour into cake pans and bake: Pour the batter into the three prepared cake pans, taking care to divide evenly. Bake at 350\xc2\xb0F on center racks of oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick or knife inserted in the center comes out clean.\n6 Cool: Allow the cakes to cool in the pan on wire racks for 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes, run a knife around the edges and remove the cakes from the pans.  Cool completely on wire racks before frosting.\n7 Make the frosting: Beat the softened butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer. With the mixer on low speed, add the powdered sugar in small amounts until all is incorporated, then add the Cointreau and vanilla and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy.\nNote: Do not add the powdered sugar while the mixer is set on a high speed, or you will create a snowy mess of sugar all over your kitchen. (Please do not ask me how I know this.)\n8 Frost the cake: Place one layer, top down, on a large plate or cake stand (this creates a smooth surface on the top and results in a more level cake). Spread frosting evenly over the first layer, then repeat with the second and third layers, then frost the sides.\n3 Sprinkle with chopped pecans: Sprinkle the top completely with the remaining cup of chopped pecans (toasted or un-toasted). Alternatively, press the chopped pecans onto the sides of the cake and leave the top simply frosted.\nThis cake is best served the day it's made and can be kept, assembled and frosted, for a few hours before servings. If you need to serve it the next day or if you have leftovers, cover the cake as well as possible and refrigerate it. Remove it from the fridge and let it come up to room temperature for an hour or two before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nCrunchy Banana Nut Granola Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: About 4 cups of granola\nI call for raw walnuts because they toast in the oven along with the granola, and nuts that have already been toasted can burn. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t find raw walnuts, you can sub raw almonds or pecans, or simply add toasted walnuts in the last 10 minutes of cooking.\nIf you like your granola in big clusters, spread the granola in a single, even layer on the baking sheets and do not stir during baking. This way, the granola will bake into one solid piece and you can break it up to clusters once cool.\nYou can store this granola in airtight containers for about a week, though it rarely lasts so long in our house.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/4 cup unsalted butter (If using salted butter, taste your mixture before adding salt)\n1/3 cup lightly packed light brown sugar\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon water\n3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (Certified gluten-free, if needed)\n3/4 cup chopped raw walnuts (See recipe notes)\n1/4 cup chia seeds\n1 tablespoon cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 medium ripe bananas, diced\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 275F with two racks placed in the upper and lower halves. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\n2 Brown the butter: Slice the butter into small pats. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, the butter will start foam a bit, then it will begin to turn amber-colored and smell fragrant and nutty.\nWatch closely, as the butter can go from browned to blackened fairly quickly. This whole process should only take about 3 minutes.\nRemove the pan from heat immediately, and pour the melted butter into a small heatproof bowl.\n3 Melt the brown sugar: In the same saucepan used to brown the butter, add the brown sugar, vanilla, and water.\nStir over medium-low heat until combined, then cook until the brown sugar is thoroughly melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.\n4 Mix the granola: In a large bowl, mix the oats, walnuts, chia seeds, cinnamon, and salt until they are combined and the ingredients look well-distributed.\nAdd the melted brown butter and brown sugar mix and stir to combine. Then add the diced bananas and stir very gently.\n5 Bake the granola: Divide the granola between two baking sheets and spread into an even layer. Place into the warm oven and bake the granola for 45 minutes.\nHalf way through baking, stir the granola, then swap the top and bottom baking sheets and rotate the pans to avoid any hotspots. (If you want big clusters of granola, do not stir the granola.)\n6 Cool the granola: Remove the granola from oven and allow to cool for 20 to 30 minutes before stirring and serving. Store in airtight containers for up to a week.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

Pour the grape juice mixture over the berries, and press down on the berries to submerge them into the juice/gelatin mixture.\n4 Chill: Cover with plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator until firm, 3 hours.\n5 Un-mold: To un-mold, fill a basin half-way with hot water. Carefully lower the bottom of the loaf pan into the hot water and hold for 5 to 8 seconds. This will melt the gelatin at the edge of the pan, helping it to release.\nRun a dull knife around the edge of the pan as well.\nPlace a serving platter topside down on top of the loaf pan and turn the whole thing over.

Break the graham crackers into a few pieces and place in the bowl of a food processor. Process the crackers until there are no large chunks left. The mixture should be sandy but not powdery.\nPour the crumbs into a bowl and stir in the melted butter, sugar, and salt. The mixture should be like wet sand and clump together when pinched.\nPress the crumbs firmly into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate to form a crust, using a measuring cup or glass to help you press firmly.\n3 Bake the graham cracker crust: Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the crust has started to turn a slightly darker brown color and smells fragrant. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool completely.\n4 Make the cream pie filling: Combine the sugar, egg yolks, and cornstarch in a medium saucepan. Whisk off the heat until they gain a little volume and turn a light yellow. Whisk in the milks and salt.\nPlace the pan over medium heat and whisk constantly until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. (If this seems to be going really slowly, it's ok to nudge the heat up a little.)\nWhen the filling ready, the whisk should momentarily leave some visible trails on the surface before disappearing. Stir in the vanilla and shredded coconut.\n5 Transfer to pie crust: Spread half of the cream filling mixture into the cooled graham cracker crust. Slice the bananas and layer them on top, then cover with the remaining custard. Make sure to cover all the bananas (so they don\xe2\x80\x99t brown!).\nSmooth the surface and press plastic wrap directly on top.\n6 Refrigerate the pie at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours to set.\n7 Make the whipped cream topping: When ready to serve the pie, use a stand mixer or hand mixer to whip the cream until it holds soft peaks. Whisk in the sugar, and continue beating until the cream holds a medium peak. Generously dollop the cream over the top of the chilled pie. Sprinkle the top with extra shredded coconut.\nOnce assembled, the pie can be kept refrigerated for a few hours before serving. (Longer than a few hours, however, and the whipped cream can start to weep. It still tastes good, but is less visually appealing!)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Published by Ten Speed Press, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC. (Photography copyright 2016 by Anson Smart.)\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the French toast:\n1 cup (240ml) unsweetened almond or macadamia milk (strained if homemade)\n1 ripe medium banana\n2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, plus more to serve\n1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon white (or black) chia seeds\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1\xe2\x81\x844 teaspoon natural salt\n8 slices gluten-free sandwich bread\n1\xe2\x81\x844 cup (60ml) coconut oil (in liquid form), plus more as needed\nFor the caramelized bananas:\n2 medium bananas, thickly sliced on the diagonal\n1\xe2\x81\x844 cup (37g) coconut sugar\n1 to 2 tablespoons coconut oil (in liquid form)\nPure maple syrup, to serve\nOptional boosters:\n1\xe2\x81\x844 cup (60ml) bourbon or rum\n2 tablespoons crushed raw pecans or walnuts\n1 tablespoon unsweetened dried shredded coconut\nSpecial equipment:\nBlender\nMETHOD\n1 Set the oven to its lowest temperature or the \xe2\x80\x9cwarm\xe2\x80\x9d setting.\n2 Make the French toast batter: Combine the milk, banana, maple syrup, vanilla, chia seeds, cinnamon, and salt into your blender and blast on high for about 30 seconds, until well combined. Pour the mixture into a large shallow baking dish and let rest for about 5 minutes to thicken slightly.\n3 Soak the bread in the batter: In batches, place slices of the bread in the baking dish and let soak on one side for 8 to 10 seconds. Flip the slices and let soak for another 8 to 10 seconds, until evenly moistened.\n4 Cook the French toast: In a medium skillet (that fits two slices of bread) or on a large griddle (that holds all of the slices) over medium heat, warm 1 to 2 tablespoons of coconut oil per two slices of bread. (Resist the urge to use less coconut oil, or the bread won\xe2\x80\x99t get crispy.)\nAdd the bread and fry for 4 to 6 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy on the edges; you may need to add more coconut oil after you flip the bread. If cooking in batches, transfer the French toast to a lined baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm, and repeat to fry the remaining bread, adding more coconut oil to cook each batch.\n5 While the last pieces of toast are cooking, make the caramelized bananas. Combine the banana slices and the coconut sugar in a zipper-lock bag, seal, and shake to coat evenly. In a skillet over medium-high heat, warm the coconut oil, add the coated bananas and the bourbon booster (if using), and fry for about 2 minutes on each side until nicely caramelized.\n6 To serve: Serve two slices of French toast on each plate, topped with one-quarter of the caramelized bananas, one-quarter of the crushed nut boosters, and one-quarter of the coconut booster.

b"Save It Print\nChocolate Banana Bread Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Makes one 9x5-inch loaf\nUse very ripe or over-ripe bananas. The peels should be at least half browned, and the bananas inside squishy and browning.\nDo not use Dutch processed cocoa for this recipe, only natural unsweetened.\nMelted coconut oil can be used in place of the butter. The flavor will change a little and you may get a hint of coconut in the result.\nThere is only 1 egg and 1 teaspoon of baking soda in this recipe for leavening, so make sure your baking soda is still good! (See more info on baking soda and baking powder.)\nINGREDIENTS\n3 large ripe bananas (easily mashable)\n1/3 cup melted butter\n3/4 cup brown sugar (packed, light or dark)\n1 teaspoon salt (1/2 a teaspoon if using salted butter)\n1 large egg, beaten\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 1/4 cup all purpose flour\n1/4 cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\n1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips\nSpecial equipment:\n1 5x9-inch loaf pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare pan and preheat oven:  Butter or spray with cooking spray the inside of a 5x9-inch loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) with a rack in the middle.\n2 Pur\xc3\xa9e bananas: Using a blender, food processor, or a fork, pur\xc3\xa9e the peeled ripe bananas until smooth. You should have 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups of banana pur\xc3\xa9e.\n3 Mix wet ingredients and sugar: Place the banana pur\xc3\xa9e into a large mixing bowl. Stir the melted butter. Stir in the brown sugar and salt. Whisk to break up any clumps of brown sugar. Stir in the beaten egg and vanilla extract.\n4 Mix dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and allspice.\n5 Add the flour mixture to the banana mixture and stir until just incorporated.\nStir in the chocolate chips.\n6 Bake: Pour batter into a buttered loaf pan. Place in a 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) oven and bake for 1 hour.\nNote that because of the chocolate chips that melt in the bread as it cooks, it's hard to check for doneness using a tester that you insert.\nOne way to test is to gently push the center top of the chocolate banana bread down with your finger. If it feels relatively firm and bounces back when you release your finger, that's a good sign that it's done.\n7 Let cool: Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes in the pan.\nGently remove the loaf from the pan and place on a rack to cool completely.\nSlice with a serrated bread knife to serve.\nHello!

The salt is totally non-traditional, though, so omit if you want that nostalgic, ultra-sweet Magic Bar experience.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups (225 g) graham cracker crumbs\n1/2 cup (115 g / 1 stick) melted unsalted butter\n14 ounces (396 g / 1 can) sweetened condensed milk\n1 cup (185 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips\n1 cup (185 g) butterscotch chips\n1 cup (115 g) chopped pecans\n1 cup (105 g) shredded sweetened coconut\n1 teaspoon flaky sea salt (like Maldon), optional\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with cooking oil then line it with parchment paper.\n2 Make the graham cracker crust: Place the graham cracker crumbs and the melted butter in a bowl. Toss with a fork until the crumbs are moist and hold together when squeezed with your hand.\nDump the crumbs in the middle of the pan and then press them into an even layer with your fingers or the back of a flat-bottomed cup.\n3 Pour the sweetened condensed milk over the graham cracker crust. Spread to edges of the pan with a spatula.\n4 Layer on the rest of the toppings: In this order, sprinkle the chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, pecans, and then sweetened coconut over the top of the condensed milk.\nGently press the ingredients down with your palm so they stick to the condensed milk.\n5 Bake in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Bake until the edges of the bars turn golden-brown and start to pull away slightly from the sides of the pan. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the sea salt (if using).\n6 Cool completely before lifting the bars out of the pan using the parchment paper. (Stick them in the fridge for a few hours or overnight if needed to help firm up.) Cut into 24 pieces and store in an airtight container with wax paper or parchment paper between layers.\nThe flavor of the bars is even better the day after baking. Bars stored at room temperature will be fairly soft and are best eaten within 3 to 5 days. For firm and chewy bars, store in the fridge for up to a week.\nHello!

b'Print\nFudgy Gluten-Free Chocolate Brownies Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesCooling Time: 2 hours time: Yield: 16 small, 2-inch square brownies\nIf you\'ve never baked gluten-free before, we highly recommend using Bob\'s Red Mill 1:1 Gluten Free Baking Flour Blend for this recipe.\nIf you\'re using a different blend, double check the ingredients. If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t contain xanthan gum (or another binding ingredient like guar gum or psyllium husks), we recommend adding 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum to ensure success.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 tablespoons ground flax\n1 cup (148 grams) gluten-free flour blend, like Bob\'s Red Mill\n1/2 cup (40 grams) dairy-free cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 cup coconut oil at room temperature, plus more for the pan\n5 ounces (140g) bittersweet dairy-free chocolate, chopped\n1 1/2 cups (300 grams) sugar\n1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract\nMETHOD\n1 Heat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F and prepare the pan: Line an 8\xc3\x978 square baking pan with parchment paper, and grease the parchment paper and pan with a little coconut oil.\n2 Prepare the flax "egg": Combine the flax with 8 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Let stand for 7 to 10 minutes to thicken. (This will be used as an egg replacer in this recipe.)\n3 Whisk dry ingredients: In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.\n4 Melt the coconut oil and chocolate: In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the coconut oil and chopped chocolate, stirring until the chocolate is completely melted, about 2 minutes.\n5 Add the sugar and vanilla: Whisk the sugar and vanilla into the chocolate mixture, stirring vigorously until combined. The mixture will be a little grainy at this point, which is perfectly okay.\n6 Make the batter: Pour the chocolate mixture into a large mixing bowl, scraping everything from the pan. Fold in the flax eggs.\nAdd the dry ingredients and stir well with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until well combined. The batter will be quite thick and will gather into a ball\xe2\x80\x94it won\xe2\x80\x99t be loose and thin like many traditional brownie batters.\n7 Scoop the batter into the prepared pan, and use a rubber spatula or the palm of your hand to press it into the pan in an even layer.\n8 Bake the brownies for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the edges are set and no longer jiggly. The tops of the brownies will still feel very soft and may even be bubbling a little; they\xe2\x80\x99ll firm up as they cool.\n9 Cool: Let the brownies cool completely before slicing, at least 2 to 3 hours. Because these are so fudgy, they really will slice best if you allow them to fully cool.\n10 Slice, serve, and store: Using the parchment paper as a handle, lift the cooled brownies up out of the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice into a 4x4 grid (making 16 small squares). Leftover brownies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper; set aside.\n2 Melt the chocolate and butter: Set the chocolate and butter in a heat-proof bowl over a pot of simmering water\xe2\x80\x94the bottom of the bowl should not touch the water. Stir until the chocolate has melted. Remove from heat.\n  3 Make the batter: Whisk together the eggs, both sugars, coffee powder, and vanilla extract. Add in the flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder, and melted butter-chocolate mixture and stir until evenly combined. (The batter will be very thick, but don't worry! That's how it's supposed to be.)\nPress the brownie batter into the prepared baking dish in an even layer.\n   4 Add the peanut butter swirl. Warm the peanut butter in the microwave until it's loosened enough to drizzle, about 30 seconds on high. Stir the powdered sugar into the peanut butter, then drizzle over the top of the brownie batter.\nUse a butter knife to swirl the peanut butter mixture into the top of the brownie batter. Be careful not to over mix the peanut butter into the brownie mixture.\n5 Bake the brownies: Bake the brownies until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out mostly clean, about 35 minutes. (The peanut butter will probably stick to the toothpick a little bit; that's fine.) Transfer to a wire rack to cool.\n6 Cool and slice: Let the brownies cool completely to room temperature before cutting them. For cleaner slicing with fewer crumbs, pop the pan in the freezer for a few minutes once it's cooled to room temperature to help with slicing to help keep them from sticking to the knife.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nChocolate Peanut Butter Bars Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 5 minutesYield: Makes 3 dozen bars.\nThese bars freeze well if you want to make ahead.\nINGREDIENTS\nPeanut butter layer:\n1 1/4 cup of graham cracker crumbs (use toasted matzo crumbs* or ground Passover crispy cereal if following the Passover dietary rules)\n1 1/4 cup of confectioner's sugar (use Passover-friendly confectioner's sugar** if following Passover dietary rules)\n3/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp of crunchy, natural peanut butter (no added preservatives or corn syrup)\n8 Tbsp (4-ounces) unsalted butter, melted\n2 Tbsp honey\nChocolate topping:\n9-ounces semi-sweet chocolate chips (1 1/2 cups) (use Kosher chocolate chips if making for Passover)\n1 Tbsp butter\nEquipment needed:\nA 9x9-inch square baking pan with straight sides (can also use an 8x10 or 8x11 baking pan)\nFood processor\nParchment paper or non-stick aluminum foil\n* Take 4 or 5 sheets of matzo, roughly break into chunks, toast in a hot dry skillet on high heat until the crumbs begin to brown and you can smell the matzo toasting. Remove from heat, let cool for a minute, place in a food processor or mini-chopper, and pulse until ground to the consistency of coarse bread crumbs.\n**2 cups of granulated sugar in a food processor or blender, and 2 Tbsp of potato starch. Process until very fine. Use 1 1/4 cups for this recipe. You'll have some leftover which can be used for other recipes for Passover.\n  METHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Line the baking pan with parchment paper or non-stick aluminum foil. Line the pan in a way so that you have an overhang on at least 2 opposite sides of the pan to make it easy to lift up the bars once they have set.\n2 In the bowl of a food processor place the crumbs and the powdered sugar. Pulse until well mixed. Add the peanut butter, melted butter, and honey. Process until well blended. The mixture should hold together, almost like a dough. If it's too dry, add a little more melted butter. If it's too wet, after you press it into the bottom of the pan in the next step, you can chill it in the fridge for 10 minutes to firm up a bit.\n3 Press the peanut butter mixture into the bottom of your lined pan in an even layer. You can use the flat bottom of a measuring cup, small saucepan, or smaller baking pan to press on the mixture to help make the surface more even.\n4 Place a metal bowl over a saucepan with simmering water (not boiling, but gently simmering). Place the chocolate chips and butter into the bowl.  Melt the chocolate chips, stirring occasionally, until smooth.\n5 Spread the melted chocolate evenly over the peanut butter layer in the pan. (An offset spatula is a good tool for this.) Refrigerate for at least an hour.\n6 Lift the contents from the pan onto a cutting board. Cut into 36 bars, 1-inch by 2 1/4 inches.\nHello!

Coat the exposed sides of the pan with cooking spray (also, a little cooking spray under the parchment will help it stick in place, if needed).\n2 Combine the dry ingredients: In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n3 Melt the chocolate and butter: In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. It should not brown at the edges.\nAdd the chocolate and let it melt, stirring occasionally with a heatproof spatula, until the mixture is smooth.\n4 Set the pan on a cooling rack to cool until you can touch the bottom of with your hand comfortably.\n5 Make the batter: Using a rubber spatula, stir the sugar into the chocolate mixture until it combined. The mixture may look crumbly or smooth after mixing; either is fine.\nAdd the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla. Add the flour mixture, and stir until no more white patches show. Stir in the chips until well distributed.\n6 Pour the batter into the pan. Use a spatula to spread it to the edges of the pan and smooth the top. Tap the pan once or twice hard on the counter to settle any air pockets; you can also poke the air pockets with the tip of a paring knife.\n7 Bake the brownies: Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is slightly puffed and just set. If in doubt, it's better to under-bake these brownies a touch rather than over-bake. (The toothpick test doesn't work well for these brownies because the chocolate chips get melty!)\n8 Cool the brownies completely: Set the pan on a wire rack until completely cooled.\n9 Once cool, cover the pan and refrigerate for several hours or until firm and cold. This makes the brownies easier to slice cleanly.\nIf you're eager for brownies and can't wait for them to chill, skip this chilling step and serve them warm or just-cooled! They will be a little crumbly when you cut them.)\n6 Cut the squares: Run a thin knife around the edge of the pan to make sure the block of brownies is loose, then lift from the pan using the parchment paper sling. On a cutting board, slice the brownies into a 4x4 grid (to make 16 squares) or into a 5x5 grid (to make 25 mini-brownies).\nBrownies can be served right away. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for at least a week. (They will keep for longer, but may start getting dry and crumbly after a while.)\nHello!

Add the butter and pulse until you get a fine, sandy texture\xe2\x80\x94all of the butter should be incorporated.\nAdd the egg yolk and pulse until it\xe2\x80\x99s combined, 10 to 15 times. The crumbs should hold together when squeezed in the palm of your hand. If they do not, sprinkle a tablespoon of water over top and pulse a few more times.\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a food processor, you can cut the butter into the flour with a pastry blender or a fork. It will take longer, but work just fine.\n  3 Refrigerate the crumb topping: Scoop out about 1/3 of the crumb mixture and press it into a bowl, which helps to make larger clumps of crumbs for the topping. Cover and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes or until needed for the topping.\n4 Press the bottom crust into the pan: Firmly press the remaining 2/3 of the crumbs into the bottom of the prepared pan to create the base for the bars. I like to use a measuring cup to press the crumbs into the pan and really compact the crust.\n5 Make the blueberry filling and top with crumbs: In a mixing bowl, toss the blueberries with the sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and zest together to coat.

Spray a 9x13 baking pan with non-stick spray and line with parchment paper, allowing the edges to hang over the sides of the pan. This will help remove the bars for slicing and keep the crust intact.\n2 Make the graham cracker crust: Combine all the ingredients for the graham cracker crust in a bowl. Stir the mixture together until it looks like wet sand. If it still looks dry, add an another tablespoon of melted butter. Transfer to the lined baking pan and press with your hand or the bottom of a drinking glass to form an even crust.\n3 Make the streusel topping: In the same bowl used to make the graham cracker mixture, combine the ingredients for the streusel topping. Mix the ingredients together, using your hands if needed, to ensure the mixture comes together evenly. The mixture should resemble large crumbles. Set aside.\n4 Make the pumpkin filling: In a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat the cream cheese, sugar and vanilla until smooth. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides of the bowl. Add the eggs, one at a time, mixing for 30 seconds in between. Scrape the bowl down again. Add in the pumpkin puree and pumpkin pie spice, and mix until completely combined.\n5 Assemble the bars: Pour the pumpkin filling into the pan on top of the graham cracker crust. Smooth out evenly. Sprinkle the streusel topping over the pumpkin filling.\n6 Bake the bars for 45 to 50 minutes: Check the bars at 40 minutes to see how quickly they are baking. When done, a toothpick inserted in the middle should come out cleanly.\n7 Cool the bars completely and refrigerate: Let the bars cool to room temperature on a wire rack.

The crust doubles as the crumble topping. Just make sure to dice the strawberry and rhubarb in to small 1/4-inch chunks, so that they turn into a jammy fruit center filling. Larger pieces of fruit will lead to a chunkier filling.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crust and crumble dough\n3 cups (420 g) all-purpose flour\n1 cup (200 g) white granulated sugar\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 cup (225 g or 2 sticks) unsalted butter, cold\n1 large egg\nFor the fruit filling\n2 cups (250 g) diced 1/4-inch chunks) rhubarb (2 to 3 thick stalks or 5 to 6 thin stalks or a little over 1/2 pounds)\n2 cups (310 g) diced (1/4-inch chunks) strawberries (3/4 pounds)\n3 tablespoons white granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 375\xc2\xb0F. Spray a 9x13-inch pan with cooking oil. Line the pan with parchment paper with the one inch of extra parchment paper hanging over the sides.\n  2 Make the dough: Combine the flour, sugar, baking powder, cinnamon, and salt in a medium-sized bowl. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch chunks and sprinkle over the dry ingredients. Using your fingers, squish the butter, breaking it down into small bits and mixing the dry ingredients together. The butter should be the size of small peas, but flat, not in chunks.\nAdd the egg and toss together with a fork at first, then massage into the dough with your hand. The dough will be crumbly.\n   3 Divide the dough and shape the crust: Scoop 1 cup (about 170 g) of the crumbly dough and set it aside.\nDump the remaining dough into the bottom of the lined pan and press down on it firmly with your hands or with the flat bottom of a cup, to form an even layer of dough at the bottom.\n  4 Make the filling and add to the pan: Combine all the ingredients in a bowl (you can use the same bowl you made the dough if you\xe2\x80\x99d like, no need to clean it). Spread it out evenly over the bottom crust.\n  5 Top with crumbles and bake: Sprinkle the reserved crumbly dough over the fruit filling. Bake in the oven 40 to 45 minutes, or until the top of the fruit is bubbling and the crumb topping is golden brown. Cool completely in the pan until it reaches room temperature.\n6 Cool and cut the bars: Use the side of the parchment paper to lift up and move the entire block carefully to a cutting board. Cut into bars. Serve at room temperature. Store in the refrigerator in an airtight container for 2 to 3 days.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Cut into 25 squares if serving at a potluck or large gathering, or into 16 squares if you're in the mood for a bigger treat.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 1/3 cups (5 oz) mini pretzels, for the crumb crust, plus additional whole pretzels for topping\n6 tablespoons melted butter\n3 tablespoons sugar\n1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk (397g), divided\n1/4 cup (57g) smooth peanut butter\n3/4 cups (100g) peanut butter chips\n1/2 cup (100g) mini chocolate chips\n1 1/2 cups (75g) unsweetened coconut flakes\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep pan: Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Line an 8x8-inch square baking pan with foil, allowing a couple inches to overhang down the side of the pan. Generously, coat with cooking spray or brush with melted butter. Set aside. If using a glass baking dish, lower the oven temperature to 325\xe2\x84\x89.\n2 Warm the peanut butter: Pour 1/4 cup of sweetened condensed milk into a small bowl and set aside. In another bowl small bowl, add the peanut butter and remaining condensed milk. When combined you should have about 1 1/4 cups. Microwave for 30 seconds. Stir the mixture until smooth. Set aside to cool.\n3 Make the crust: In the bowl of a food processor, add 3 cups whole pretzels and process for 15 seconds until the largest pieces are the size of small peas. Measure out 1 1/4 cups (120 g) pretzel crumbs and return them to the food processor bowl. (If you have extra crumbs save them to sprinkle on ice cream!)\nAdd the sugar and melted butter and process continuously for 20 seconds. The mixture will look like wet sand.\nPour the pretzel mixture into the prepared pan. Use a measuring cup or glass to press the mixture firmly into an even layer in the bottom of the pan.\n4 Bake the crust: Bake the crust until it feels firm to the touch and is slightly golden around the edges, about 10 minutes.\n5 Assemble the first layer: Stir the peanut butter and condensed mixture again, then pour 3/4 cup of the peanut butter mixture over the baked crust. Use a towel, or oven mitts to gently tilt the pan from corner to corner so the peanut butter mixture completely covers the crust. Top with half of the shredded coconut, half of the peanut butter chips and half of the chocolate chips.\n6 Finish assembling: Pour remaining 1/2 cup peanut butter and condensed milk mixture over the entire layer. Top with remaining shredded coconut, peanut butter and chocolate chips. Arrange whole pretzels on top and use your hands to gently press the bars down to ensure the layers are compact. Drizzle with the reserved condensed milk.\n7 Bake the bars: Bake on the center rack of the oven for 30-35 minutes until the edges are turning golden and the center is just starting to take on color. The center might be a little soft but the bars will firm up as it cools.\n8 Cool: Remove the bars from the oven and cool on a cooling rack for 1 1/2 hours. Take out of the pan and remove foil. Continue cooling on rack for an additional 1 hour. Once bars reach room temperature, wrap in plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator for 2 hours or overnight. This will ensure that the bars slice cleanly with the least amount of crumbling. You can cut them once they\xe2\x80\x99ve cooled to room temp, but the crust may crumble.\n9 Serve & store: Once the bars are chilled, slice into 16 squares and serve. Store leftover magic bars in an air-tight container in the refrigerator for 7 days or at room temperature for 5 days.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

You will use this to lift the bars out of the pan and cut them at the end.\nPreheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0 F.\n2 Combine the dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, and salt.\n3 Add the butter: Cut the cold butter in cubes. Toss the cubes in flour. Pinch and smoosh the flour and butter together between your thumbs and fingers until the butter is coated with flour and broken into the flat butter pieces, between the sizes of smooshed almonds and peas. (Alternatively, you can blitz it in a food processor 6 or 7 times until the butter has a similar visual appearance.)\n4 Bake the crust: Dump the crust into your prepared baking dish, press it down firmly it into an even layer with your fingers, and place in the oven.\nBake for 20-25 minutes. The crust is ready when it looks dry and is slightly golden at the edges.\n5 When the crust only has about 10 minutes left to bake, make your filling: In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, yolk, and sugar. Whisk in the flour until you no longer see clumps. Whisk in the lemon juice and vanilla.\n6 Bake the lemon bars: When the crust has finished baking, remove it from the oven and pour the curd over the warm crust. Return to the oven.\nBake for 12 minutes in a glass pan or 10 minutes in a metal pan. The filling is ready when it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t jiggle and has lots of little bubbles on top. All ovens are different, so start checking 2 minutes before you think it\xe2\x80\x99s ready. Don\xe2\x80\x99t over-bake it, or the filling will be spongy.\n7 Cool and cut the bars: Remove from oven and let cool for 1 hour, uncovered, either on the counter or in the refrigerator. Use the parchment sling to lift the bars onto a cutting board. Cut into squares and dust with powdered sugar.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

The name is thought to come from 19th century New England, deriving from the word Schneckennudeln, a type of snail-shaped German cinnamon roll. Snickerdoodles are famously associated with the Pennsylvania Dutch and the Amish communities of Indiana, which explains how they made their way to the Midwest and have long been a homespun favorite here.\nAnd, of course, if you can find a way to turn something, anything at all, into a recipe that can be crammed into a 9x13, it becomes extra midwestern. The swath of frosting on top gilds the lily here, but it\xe2\x80\x99s so worth it.\nExcerpted from Midwest Made by Shauna Sever. Copyright \xc2\xa9 2019. Available from Running Press, an imprint of Hachette Book Group, Inc.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the bars:\n2 3/4 cups (352 g) all-purpose flour, spooned and leveled\n2 teaspoons cream of tartar, sifted\n1 1/4 teaspoons fine sea salt\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon (Shauna Sever recommends Vietnamese cinnamon)\n1 cup (225 g) unsalted butter, at room temperature\n3/4 cup (170 g) light brown sugar\n3/4 cup (150 g) granulated sugar\n1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n2 large eggs, room temperature\n1/4 cup (57 g) whole milk\nFor the frosting:\n3/4 cup (170 g) unsalted butter, room temperature\n1 1/2 cups (180 g) powdered sugar\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon, plus more for dusting (optional)\n1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon whole milk\n1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract\n1/4 teaspoon fine sea salt\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the pan and the oven: Position a rack in the center of the oven and preheat it to 325\xc2\xb0F.  Line a 9x13 light-colored metal baking pan with aluminum foil and spray it with nonstick cooking spray.\n2 Whisk together the dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, cream of tartar, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon.\n3 Make the batter: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy. Add the brown and granulated sugar and vanilla and beat until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, giving each about 30 seconds of beating to fully incorporate. Beat in the milk.\nReduce the speed to low and gradually beat in the flour mixture. Finish stirring the batter by hand to make sure every bit is incorporated.\n4 Bake the bars: Spread the batter in the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top looks puffy and begins to turn golden. Rotate the pan 180 degrees, and while doing so, rap the pan on the oven rack until the bars deflate.\nBake for 5 minutes more, or until the bars have pulled away from the sides of the pan and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean. The bars will still look quite soft.\nIf they\xe2\x80\x99ve puffed back up during the last minutes of baking, rap the pan on the countertop once again.\n5 Let cool completely in the pan set on a wire rack.\n6 Make the frosting: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat the butter on medium speed until creamy. Add the powdered sugar, cinnamon, milk, vanilla, and salt, and beat until smooth. Raise the mixer speed to high and beat until very light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.\n7 Frost the bars: Spread the frosting over the cooled bars. Lightly dust cinnamon over the entire pan, if you wish. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nBarbecued Chicken on the Grill Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 45 minutesYield: Serves 4-6\nChicken thighs and legs will hold up better to long, slow cooking than will breasts which can more easily dry out. If you barbecue breasts, keep them on the coolest part of the grill (or follow this method).\nThis recipe assumes fairly large chicken pieces (like the main pieces from a 4 to 5 pound whole chicken). If you are working with smaller chicken pieces, they may require a shorter cooking time. If you are cooking wings, they too may be done before the other larger pieces.\nA note about the skin. Even if you do not plan on eating the chicken skin, it\'s still best to barbecue it with it on. The skin will protect the chicken pieces from drying out.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 pounds of your favorite chicken parts (legs, thighs, wings, breasts), skin-on\nSalt\nExtra virgin olive oil or vegetable oil\n1 cup barbecue sauce, store-bought or homemade\nMETHOD\n1 Oil and salt chicken pieces: Coat the chicken pieces with olive oil and sprinkle salt over them on all sides.\n2 Prepare grill: Prepare one side of your grill for high, direct heat. If you are using charcoal or wood, make sure there is a cool side to the grill where there are few to no coals.\n3 Sear chicken on hot side of grill, move to cool side: Lay the chicken pieces skin side down on the hottest side of the grill in order to sear the skin side well. Grill uncovered for 5-10 minutes, depending on how hot the grill is (you do not want the chicken to burn).\nOnce you have a good sear on one side, turn the chicken pieces over and move them to the cooler side of the grill.\nIf you are using a gas grill, maintain the flame on only one side of the grill, and move the chicken pieces to the cooler side, not directly over the flame. Reduce the temp to low or medium low (between 250\xc2\xb0F and 275\xc2\xb0F, no more than 300\xc2\xb0F).\nCover the grill and cook undisturbed for 20-30 minutes.\n4 Turn over and baste with barbecue sauce: Turn the chicken pieces over and baste them with with your favorite barbecue sauce. Cover the grill again and allow to cook for another 15-20 minutes.\nRepeat, turning the chicken pieces over, basting them with sauce, covering, and cooking for another 10-30 minutes.\nNOTE that timing will depend on your grill set-up, the size of your chicken pieces, and how cold your chicken pieces are to start with! If you are grilling smaller pieces of chicken on a charcoal grill, they may be done much earlier. The goal is to maintain a low enough grill temp so that the chicken cooks "low and slow".\n5 Finish with a sear or remove from heat when done: The chicken is done when the internal temperature of the chicken pieces are 160\xc2\xb0F for breasts and 170\xc2\xb0F for thighs, when tested with a meat thermometer.\nOr if you insert the tip of a knife into the middle of the thickest piece and the juices should run clear, the chicken is done.\nIf the chicken isn\'t done, turn the pieces over and continue to cook at a low temperature.\nIf you want, you can finish with a sear on the hot side of the grill. To do this, put the pieces, skin side down, on the hot side of the grill. Allow them to sear and blacken slightly for a minute or two.\n6 Paint with more barbecue sauce to serve.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nSlow and Low Country Ribs Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 3 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6-8\nINGREDIENTS\n4 country ribs, about 3 pounds\nKosher salt\nVegetable oil\nThe barbecue sauce of your choice\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cut and salt the ribs: Country ribs are usually more than a foot long. We recommend slicing them in half before cooking, as they'll be easier to handle. Coat the ribs in oil and then salt them well.\nMuch of the fat will render away in cooking, leaving a crispy-salty-fatty bit you will be fighting over with your friends.\n2 Slow cook the ribs for 90 min to start: To cook the ribs, you have several choices. You can bake them in a 250\xc2\xb0F oven (line a baking pan with foil and cover the pan).\nYou can slow-roast them in a gas grill (covered) with half the burners turned off (put them on the side that is not over direct flame).\nYou can set up a large charcoal grill like a smoker and cook the country ribs on the cool side (again covered). But best of all would be to build a wood fire on one side of the grill and slowly barbecue these ribs over woodsmoke.\nNo matter what you do, let the ribs cook untouched for 90 minutes. At the 90-minute mark, turn them and paint them with your barbecue sauce \xe2\x80\x93 we like the sweet-spicy Dr. Pepper BBQ sauce for this, but you could also use a South Carolina mustard-based barbecue sauce, a Bourbon BBQ sauce, or a traditional Kansas City-style sauce.\n3 Then, every 30 minutes or so, turn your ribs and paint them again with the sauce. How long to cook? Depends on how hot your fire is. At least 3 hours. Maybe as many as 5 hours. You really, really want to slow-cook these ribs because they are pretty fatty. The slower you cook them, the more fat renders out and the smoother your ribs will be. Take your time.\n4 Move to hot side of grill or broil: When the meat begins to fall apart \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99ll notice this when you turn the rib \xe2\x80\x93 you\xe2\x80\x99re ready for the final step. Paint the ribs one more time and then move them to the hot side of the grill. If you are using the oven method, move the ribs to the broiler.\nLet the ribs cook a minute or two so the sauce can caramelize. Pay attention, and do not let the ribs get too blackened. A little char is good, but you don\xe2\x80\x99t want a briquette.\nServe with coleslaw, potato salad, deviled eggs or whatever you\xe2\x80\x99d like. Oh, and napkins. Lots of napkins.\nHello!

Figure on 1/2 pound of meat (before cooking) per person.\nA Santa Maria rub has salt, pepper, and either garlic salt or garlic powder. That's the base of the rub, anything beyond that is optional.\nIf you don't have access to the tri-tip cut where you are, try using a thick london broil or sirloin steak.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tri-tip roast, also known as triangle steak, a bottom sirloin cut (anywhere from 2 1/2 pounds to 4 pounds), look for one well-marbled with fat\nSanta Maria Rub (enough for a 4 pound roast)\n1 Tbsp Kosher salt\n1 Tbsp finely ground black pepper\n1 Tbsp garlic powder\n1 Tbsp onion powder\n1 teaspoon cayenne\n1 Tbsp dried oregano\n1 teaspoon dry rosemary (or fresh, finely minced)\n1/2 teaspoon dry sage\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Mix rub and massage into roast: Mix the rub ingredients together in a bowl.\nPlace the roast in a roasting pan or a baking pan with edges (this will help keep the rub from getting all over the floor).\nSprinkle the rub on the meat on all sides, and massage the rub into the meat.\n2 Cover and let sit at room temp for an hour. Cover the roast with foil or plastic wrap and let it sit at room temp for an hour to take the chill off and allow the rub to work its magic on the roast.\n3 Prepare grill: Prepare your grill for hot direct heat on one side, and indirect heat on the other. (By the way, if you are working with a wood-fired grill, Santa Maria BBQ traditionally uses red oak wood.)\n4 Sear the roast on all sides, 3-4 minutes per side. Carefully watch the roast during this process as one side of the roast is typically quite fatty and as the fat heats up it can drip down and cause flare-ups. Keep moving the tri-tip away from the flame if flare-ups occur.\n5 Move roast to cool side of grill, fat side up: Once the tri-tip is seared on all sides, move it away from direct heat and place it fat-side up on the grill rack.\nIf you are using a gas grill with a top rack, I recommend placing the roast on that rack, with an aluminum tray on the bottom rack underneath to catch the fat drippings.\nIf you are grilling on charcoal or wood, you may want to turn the roast over every few minutes, for more even heating.\nTry to maintain a grill temperature of 250\xc2\xb0F to 300\xc2\xb0F.\n6 Cover to finish cooking: Cover the grill and cook until the temperature of the interior of the tri-tip reaches 120\xc2\xb0F for a rare roast, 130\xc2\xb0F for medium-rare and 140\xc2\xb0F for medium.\nAt this point the meat will take anywhere from 20 to 40 minutes to cook, depending on how hot your grill is, how well done you want it, and the size of the cut.\nNote that the interior temperature will continue to rise at least 5\xc2\xb0F after you take the roast off the heat.\n7 Tent roast with foil to let it rest: Once the roast reaches temperature, remove it from the grill and let it rest, loosely tented with foil, for 10-15 minutes.\nSlice across the grain to serve.\nHello!

You want pretty low heat, about 200-220\xc2\xb0F if you can measure it. Make sure you have a spot to put the ribs that is not directly over the heat source. Lay the ribs down. They should not sizzle. If they do, cool the grill down until the ribs no longer sizzle when placed down. Cover the grill or smoker and walk away for an hour.\n3 Every hour or so after that, turn and rotate the ribs so they cook evenly. You should not have to baste them if you do this: The fat in the ribs will do the basting for you.

b'Save It Print\nBarbecued Pork Shoulder on a Gas Grill Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hourCook time: 8 hoursYield: Serves 6-8\nNote that this cooking time is for a 4-pound Boston butt pork shoulder. A general rule on barbecued pork is to cook it at about 215\xc2\xb0F to 225\xc2\xb0F for 90 minutes per pound.\nIf using a rub, you\'ll need to get the rub on the night before and refrigerate.\nCooking a 4 pound roast, allowing time for the barbecue to heat up and for the meat to rest once done, can easily take 9 hours, so start early in the morning if you want to have the roast done in time for dinner.\nYou need to keep smoke on the meat for at least 4 hours for a 4 pound roast. If the roast isn\'t done after 6 hours, finish it in the oven, wrapped tightly in foil to hold in the moisture.\nTwo rub recipes are provided here. Pick one for a 4 pound roast, or if barbecuing two roasts, try one each.\nINGREDIENTS\nOne 4 pound pork shoulder roast, preferably Boston butt, boneless or bone-in (you can easily make two 4 pound roasts in about the same amount of time if your grill is big enough to accommodate them both)\n5 to 6 cups of wood chips, hickory, oak, apple, or other fruit wood\nBBQ Rub (enough for a 4 pound roast)\n2 Tbsp brown sugar, packed\n2 Tbsp white sugar\n2 Tbsp paprika\n1 Tbsp kosher salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin\n1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder\n1 1/2 teaspoons chipotle chile powder\n1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper\nSanta Maria Rub (enough for a 4 pound roast)\n1 Tbsp salt\n1 Tbsp finely ground black pepper\n1 Tbsp garlic powder\n1 Tbsp onion powder\n1 teaspoon cayenne\n1 Tbsp dried oregano\n1 teaspoon dry rosemary (or fresh, finely minced)\n1/2 teaspoon dry sage\n1/4 teaspoon sugar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nThe day before:\n1. Prepare the rub. Mix all the ingredients for the rub together, breaking up any clumps. Taste the rub as you make it and see if you like the taste, adjust accordingly.\n2. Rub the roast with the rub. Unwrap the pork roast and place it on its butcher paper or in a roasting pan, something that can catch the rub. With your (clean) hands work the rub mixture into the pork shoulder all over, including inside any crevasses you may find in a boneless roast where the bone had been. Be generous with the amount of rub.\nRewrap it in the butcher paper or wrap it in plastic and place it in a pan (to catch any liquid that may drip out), and refrigerate it overnight.\nThe night before:\n3. Soak the wood chips. Take 3 or 4 large handfuls of wood chips (hickory, oak, apple or other fruit wood) and place them in a bowl and cover them with water to soak them overnight (can also do for an hour before using).\nI think it helps to have a mix of sizes, from small chips to larger (1-inch x 2-inch) chunks. The smaller chips will get smoking more quickly, but will burn out more quickly too. The larger chunks will take longer to catch, but last well past when the smaller chips have burned themselves out.\nThe Day Of:\n4. Bring the chilled roast to room temp. 1 to 2 hours before you start the barbecue, take the pork out of the refrigerator to come to room temperature.\nNow, if you forget to do this, which I have done, you can still go ahead and BBQ it. You\'ll likely be finishing it in the oven anyway. It will just take a bit longer to cook.\n5. Prepare your grill. Remove one of the grill grates. This will be your "hot" side, where the wood chips will go. The other side of the grill will be the "cool" side, and where the meat will be, away from direct heat.\nDepending on the structure of your grill, you may want to remove the "flavor bar", the thin metal piece with lots of holes in it that sits over the burner. The wood chips will smoke more easily if they lay in a (fireproof metal or foil) container directly on the burner.\n6. Place a tray of water on the grill: If there is room on your grill, place a small aluminum tray of water on the grill to help moderate the heat and help keep the roast from getting too dry. A good place to place this is on an upper rack if you grill has one.\n7. Get the grill smoking. Create a double layered aluminum foil boat with a handful or two of damp wood chips in it.\nPlace the boat directly on the burner on the "hot" side of the grill if you can (otherwise place on the flavor bar). Turn the grill on to medium flame, cover the grill and let it heat up until the the wood chips start smoking.\nYou\'ll either see smoke coming out of the grill, or if you raise the lid, you\'ll see smoke coming out of the wood chip boat. You should see and smell the smoke.\nYou\'ll be replenishing the wood chips periodically for the next several hours so put more dry chips into water to soak if needed.\n8. Cook roast on cool side of grill, fat side up: Once the grill is smoking, place the roast on the grill grates on the cool side of the grill, away from direct heat. If your grill has a hot spot, position the roast away from it. If there is a fatty side to the meat, put that side facing up; the fat will render over time and baste the pork.\nCover the grill, lower the flame, and let the cooking begin. The temperature you want to maintain ideally is 225\xc2\xb0F. Try to keep it close to that temperature, within a range of 210\xc2\xb0F to 240\xc2\xb0F. If the temperature goes too high, the roast may dry out. If it\'s too low, it will take forever to cook.\n9. Maintain the smoke and the 225\xc2\xb0F temperature. This is the tricky part. You will want to maintain smoke in the grill for at least 4 hours (6 hours for a bigger roast). You will also want to maintain a cooking temperature of around 225\xc2\xb0. So, you have to check the grill!\nCheck if the temperature is being maintained between 210\xc2\xb0F and 240\xc2\xb0F, and check to make sure the chips are still producing smoke, every half hour. About once an hour you will likely need to replenish the chip boat with more wood chips.\nResist the temptation to open the grill more than once an hour. Every time you open the grill the inside temperature drops and you increase your overall cooking time.\nI found the best way to check the temperature, since I don\'t have a gauge in the grill itself, is to put an instant read meat thermometer into an opening in the hood on the meat side (cool side) of the grill, and just keep checking it. Make sure sensor tip of the probe is not touching the meat itself.\nYou want to avoid opening up the hood too often, because every time you do that, you lose heat. Of course, if your gas grill gets too hot, opening the hood can cool it down quickly.\nExpect a minimum cooking time, if you have been diligent at maintaining a 225\xc2\xb0F, of 90 minutes per pound. So if you are cooking a 4 pound roast, total cooking time will be at least 6 hours (and easily more). An 8 pound roast will take at least 12 hours of cooking time.\nIf you want to cook 8 pounds of pork shoulder more quickly, I recommend starting with two 4 pound roasts, spaced on the grill a few inches apart, which will cook in just a little more time than an 8 pound roast.\n10 Reposition the roast: After 2 or 3 hours, during one of your hourly opening of the grill to refresh the wood chips, reposition the roast so that the side that was closest to the heat is now furthest from the heat.\n11. Test internal temperature of meat. After about 5 hours, start taking the pork\'s internal temperature: You can eat it at 165\xc2\xb0F, but if you are making pulled pork the meat needs to be ideally 195\xc2\xb0F.\n12 Remove from heat, let rest: When the meat reaches 195\xc2\xb0F, remove it from the heat, tent it loosely with foil over a cutting board (to catch the juices) and let it rest for at least 30 minutes, and preferably 1 hour.\nIf after 6 hours of cooking, if the meat hasn\'t reached 195\xc2\xb0 internal temp (usually after 6 hours, the internal temp on my roasts is about 155\xc2\xb0F), my recommendation is to remove it from the grill and finish in the oven.\nTo finish in the oven, wrap the roast in aluminum foil to help prevent it from drying out in the oven, and place it in a roasting pan, in a 300\xc2\xb0F oven.\nCook until the internal temperature of the roast reaches 195\xc2\xb0F. If your starting internal meat temperature is 150\xc2\xb0F or so, this can take anywhere from an hour to two hours.\nWhen it reaches temperature, remove the roast from the oven and let rest for at least 30 minutes, up to an hour.\n13. Pull the pork. Pull the pork with 2 forks. Only now do you add any barbecue sauce (and any accumulated juices) to the meat. Taste it first! It might not need sauce at all, and if it does, add only a little at a time. One of the biggest sins of barbecue is to over-sauce perfectly good meat.\nServe on a bun with or without sauce, and with or without coleslaw. Also great with grilled or raw pineapple.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHow to Turn Your Kettle Grill into a Smoker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1. Prep your meat and wood. I like to brine pork in a salt-sugar solution. Mine is typically 1/4 cup kosher salt with 1/2 cup brown sugar mixed with 4 cups of water. You can add any spices or herbs you want. How long? 3-6 hours for ribs or even overnight for a pork butt.\nGet your smoking wood ready by soaking it in water for at least 2 hours. Overnight is better. And when you are using a kettle grill, make sure you have wood chips: Not big blocks, not sawdust. Chips.\nAnywhere from an hour to a day before you start cooking \xe2\x80\x93 depending on how deeply spiced you want your meat \xe2\x80\x93 you can remove your meat from the brine and apply a dry rub to the meat. This is optional, especially if you have a full-flavored sauce. But most professional pit masters will use a rub as a base flavor with a sauce that complements it.\n2. Place water pans in the grill. Start barbecuing by getting your hands on some cheap metal pans you can fill with water. Disposable tin pans from the supermarket are great for this, and you do not have to toss them after each use. Fill these pans halfway with water and place them beneath the meat you are barbecuing. You want the pan or pans to take about half the space at the bottom of the grill.\nWhy water pans? Several reasons. First, it lets sauce and fat drip into something that will not wreck the bottom of your grill or cause flareups. Second, it helps keep the meat moist, which helps smoke adhere to the meat. Third, it moderates the temperature around the meat, which is vital in such a small space.\n3. Get the coals hot and put water-soaked wood chips on the coals. A chimney starter is the easiest way to get the coals lit for the grill. What kind of fuel should you use? Up to you, of course, but I would use either standard briquettes or lump hardwood charcoal. I am especially fond of lump charcoal because I get a better flavor and a cleaner smoke. Could you go all wood? Sure, but it needs to be something like oak or hickory, which burn steadily and slowly. And no logs! You must use chunks.\nYour life will be easier if you have a grill top that has hinged edges that lift up. These allow you to position one end over the coals and add more charcoal or wood as needed as you cook. If you do not have one of these grill tops, make sure you can slip briquettes through the slim opening. If you cannot, you can carefully lift the whole grate and add more when needed.\nOnce the coals are good and hot, add a couple handfuls of the soaked wood on the coals. Place the top grill grate on the grill. Position the grill grate in a way that if you are using a hinged grill grate, one of the hinged areas lifts up over the coals so you can easily get to them.\n4. Put the meat on the grill away from the coals. Lay the meat over the water pans as far away from the coals as possible. Under no circumstances should you let the meat rest directly over the coals. Cook in batches if you have to, and keep the finished meat in an oven set to \xe2\x80\x9cwarm\xe2\x80\x9d while you do more.\nCover the grill, positioning the vent on the cover directly over the meat. This helps direct the smoke over the meat. Close all vents (bottom one, too!) to keep the temperature as low as you can go; if you have an especially tight lid, keep the vents open just a little. You are now barbecuing.\n5. Watch the temperature. This would be a good time to open a beer or drink some lemonade and sit back. Keep one eye on the grill to make sure you see some smoke coming out of it. Wander over from time to time to check the temperature if your grill lid has a thermometer. It should read no higher than 325 degrees, preferably somewhere under 300. Ideally you want the temperature at the meat level around 225-250; heat rises and a lid thermometer will show the temperature at the lid, and not at the meat level. If your kettle grill does not have a thermometer built-in (most don't), put a meat thermometer into the cover vent and check it from time to time.\nIf your temperature starts to soar, open the lid and let the coals burn off a bit. Then add some more soaked wood and close the lid again; you should be OK.\nIf your temperature begins to drop below 225 degrees, open the vents. If that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t get the temperature rising, open the lid and add more coals and soaked wood.\n6. Check the coals and rotate the meat. Regardless of temperature, check your coals every hour to 90 minutes. You may need to add more. Always add more soaked wood at this point, and always turn or rotate your meat at this point, too.\n7. Timing. How long should you cook things? Depends. Fish will take from 45 to 90 minutes. Chicken an hour to two hours. Baby back ribs, such as these, will take from 90 minutes to 2 hours and 15 minutes. A Boston butt, beef brisket or tri-tip can take as long as 6 hours.\nIf you are using a barbecue sauce \xe2\x80\x93 and with everything other than a Memphis-style dry rib you probably will be \xe2\x80\x93 wait to brush it on until the final 30-45 minutes of cooking. You do not want it to burn, and because most barbecue sauces have a lot of sugar in them, they will burn easily. When barbecuing fish, do not sauce until the last 15 minutes.\nYou will be able to spot doneness with some visual cues. Meat on bones will begin to pull away. When you turn or rotate meat it will begin to fall off the bone. The flakes on fish will separate easily. The interior of a Boston butt will be somewhere around 160 degrees \xe2\x80\x93 this is the only meat I barbecue with a meat thermometer.\nWhat happens if your heat was just too high and things are looking charred? Well, hopefully you did not let it go this far because you\xe2\x80\x99d been checking every hour to 90 minutes. But if it looks like you have too much char and the meat is not yet done, have no fear: Finish the meat in a 225-degree oven. You will still have enough smoky taste to impress your guests.\nOnce your meat is done, remove it to a platter, add more sauce and let it rest for 10-15 minutes. Let a big tri-tip or Boston butt rest for 20-25 minutes. Add even more sauce right at service and enjoy! You\xe2\x80\x99ll know you cooked real barbecue if everyone has sauce under their fingernails\xe2\x80\xa6\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes or until mixture is very steamy. (The sauce can bubble and spit, so use caution. To avoid burns, stir the sauce constantly to distribute heat.)\nTurn the heat to medium-low, and cook until sauce has thickened, 5 to 7 minutes more. When done, the sauce should be thick enough that a spoon will leave trails through the sauce when you stir. Set aside to cool.\nOnce cool, measure 3/4 cup into a small bowl for the chicken. Set aside remaining sauce for serving. (Prepared sauce can also be made ahead and kept refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.)\n2 Twenty minutes before cooking, rub the chicken pieces on both sides with sea salt. Set in fridge while you prep grill.\n3 Prepare a charcoal grill. When coals are gray and very hot, carefully move them to one side of the grill so that one side has hot, direct heat and the other side has indirect heat. (Alternatively, prepare a gas grill with two temperature zones for cooking.)\n4 Brush chicken generously on both sides with 3/4 cups of prepare barbecue sauce.\n5 Grill the chicken over high heat to sear: Place the chicken on the hot side of grill directly over coals, placing thighs skin-side down. After 2 to 3 minutes, flip chicken and grill another 2 to 3 minutes, or until chicken is nicely browned or even slightly blackened on both sides.\n6 Finish cooking the chicken over indirect heat: Move the chicken over to side without coals to finish cooking over indirect heat. Brush once more with barbecue sauce. Cover the grill.\nAfter 5 to 7 minutes, flip chicken. Cook another 12 to 15 minutes until chicken is a rich golden brown, cooked through, and reaches an internal temperature of at least 175\xc2\xb0F when tested with a meat thermometer.\n(I usually cook these thighs and drumsticks to a slightly higher internal temperature to be sure the meat is thoroughly cooked; the sauce and indirect heat keep the chicken from drying out.)\n7 Serve immediately with extra barbecue sauce.\nHello!

You do not want the onions to turn color.\n4 Add the bourbon: Take the pan off the heat and add the bourbon. Return to the stove, turn up the heat to medium-high again and boil down the bourbon for 5 minutes.\n5 Add the ketchup, lemon juice, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, molasses, and the sugar. Mix well and return to a simmer.\n6 Cook the sauce for a few minutes to combine the flavors and then taste test it. Is it salty enough? (It should be from the Worcestershire sauce). If not, add salt. Is it spicy hot enough? If not, add a little cayenne powder. Is it sweet enough? If not, add some molasses.\n7 Let the sauce cook down slowly until it thickens, about 20 minutes. Keep it on low heat while your ribs cook. Alternatively, you can make this sauce ahead of time and reheat it when you cook the meat. It will stay good in the fridge at least a week; I've held mine for two weeks with no problem.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nGrilled Chicken with South Carolina-Style BBQ Sauce Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 4 to 6\nTo save some prep time, the BBQ sauce can be made ahead and kept refrigerated for up to two weeks.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the BBQ sauce:\n1 cup prepared yellow mustard\n1/4 cup packed dark brown sugar\n2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar\n1 tablespoon ketchup\n1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce\n1/2 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon bottled hot sauce, plus more to taste\nFor the chicken:\n4 chicken thighs, bone-in with skin\n4 drumsticks, bone-in with skin\n1 tablespoon sea salt\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make barbecue sauce at least 30 minutes ahead of grilling: Combine all the ingredients for the sauce in a 2-quart saucepan and set over medium-high heat on a back burner. Cook, stirring constantly for 2 minutes or until mixture is very steamy. (The sauce can bubble and spit, so use caution. To avoid burns, stir the sauce constantly to distribute heat.)\nTurn the heat to medium-low, and cook until sauce has thickened, 5 to 7 minutes more. When done, the sauce should be thick enough that a spoon will leave trails through the sauce when you stir. Set aside to cool.\nOnce cool, measure 3/4 cup into a small bowl for the chicken. Set aside remaining sauce for serving. (Prepared sauce can also be made ahead and kept refrigerated for up to 2 weeks.)\n2 Twenty minutes before cooking, rub the chicken pieces on both sides with sea salt. Set in fridge while you prep grill.\n3 Prepare a charcoal grill. When coals are gray and very hot, carefully move them to one side of the grill so that one side has hot, direct heat and the other side has indirect heat. (Alternatively, prepare a gas grill with two temperature zones for cooking.)\n4 Brush chicken generously on both sides with 3/4 cups of prepare barbecue sauce.\n5 Grill the chicken over high heat to sear: Place the chicken on the hot side of grill directly over coals, placing thighs skin-side down. After 2 to 3 minutes, flip chicken and grill another 2 to 3 minutes, or until chicken is nicely browned or even slightly blackened on both sides.\n6 Finish cooking the chicken over indirect heat: Move the chicken over to side without coals to finish cooking over indirect heat. Brush once more with barbecue sauce. Cover the grill.\nAfter 5 to 7 minutes, flip chicken. Cook another 12 to 15 minutes until chicken is a rich golden brown, cooked through, and reaches an internal temperature of at least 175\xc2\xb0F when tested with a meat thermometer.\n(I usually cook these thighs and drumsticks to a slightly higher internal temperature to be sure the meat is thoroughly cooked; the sauce and indirect heat keep the chicken from drying out.)\n7 Serve immediately with extra barbecue sauce.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nBourbon Barbecue Sauce Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: Makes enough for 4-6 racks of ribs\nNote that most (not all) of the alcohol from the bourbon will boil away while the sauce reduces, leaving bourbon's distinctive caramel-flavored tang.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/4 cup vegetable oil, such as canola or peanut\n1/4 cup butter\n1 chopped chile pepper, such as a serrano\n1 medium yellow or white onion, grated\n1 cup bourbon or Tennessee whiskey\n1/2 cup ketchup or tomato sauce\n1/2 cup lemon juice\n1/2 cup apple cider vinegar\n1/3 cup dark molasses\n1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce\n2-3 tablespoons brown sugar\nSalt to taste\nMETHOD\n1 Heat the butter and oil in a sauce pan over medium-high heat.\n2 Grate the onion through the coarse grate of a box grater, or finely mince the onion if you don't have a grater.\n3 Add grated onion and chile to the oil/butter combination and cook over medium heat for 3-4 minutes, or until onions turn translucent. You do not want the onions to turn color.\n4 Add the bourbon: Take the pan off the heat and add the bourbon. Return to the stove, turn up the heat to medium-high again and boil down the bourbon for 5 minutes.\n5 Add the ketchup, lemon juice, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, molasses, and the sugar. Mix well and return to a simmer.\n6 Cook the sauce for a few minutes to combine the flavors and then taste test it. Is it salty enough? (It should be from the Worcestershire sauce). If not, add salt. Is it spicy hot enough? If not, add a little cayenne powder. Is it sweet enough? If not, add some molasses.\n7 Let the sauce cook down slowly until it thickens, about 20 minutes. Keep it on low heat while your ribs cook. Alternatively, you can make this sauce ahead of time and reheat it when you cook the meat. It will stay good in the fridge at least a week; I've held mine for two weeks with no problem.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nBBQ Meatloaf Bites Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 18 meatloaf bites\nThese meatloaf bites freeze well. Bake them as directed and allow them to cool completely. Then place them on a baking sheet and freeze until frozen solid. Wrap each bite tightly in foil and store in a freezer safe bag for up to three months. Reheat frozen bites either in a muffin tin in the oven for 15 minutes at 350\xc2\xb0F. or until warmed through or in the microwave for about 2 minutes on high (not in a muffin tin).\nIf you want to make mini meatloaf bites, divide the mixture into mini muffin tins. You will get about double the amount (my kids liked the smaller ones). It\xe2\x80\x99s pretty impossible to line a mini muffin tin with foil, though, so cleanup will be more intense unless you\'re using nonstick muffin tins. Also, total baking time will be shorter, about 20 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the meatloaf bites:\n2 pounds lean ground beef (no more than 10% fat)\n1 large egg\n3/4 cup breadcrumbs\n1 small white onion, 1/2 cup diced\n1 stalk celery, 1/3 cup diced\n1 medium carrot, 1/3 cup diced\n1/2 green pepper, 1/3 cup diced\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon chili powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\nFor the BBQ Glaze:\n1 cup barbecue sauce (I like Stubbs)\n1/4 cup brown sugar\n1 tablespoon hot sauce (optional)\nDAD ADD: "Meatball" Sub (makes 1 sub)\n1 soft French roll\n2 to 3 cooked meatloaf bites\n2 tablespoons marinara sauce, store-bought or homemade\n2 ounces provolone cheese\nBanana peppers\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Make the meatloaf mixture: In a large bowl, combine ground beef, egg, breadcrumbs, onion, carrot, celery, green pepper, garlic, chili powder, salt, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Mix well\xe2\x80\x94I think using your hands works best.\n3 Fill the muffin tin with meatloaf: Line a muffin tin with foil for easier cleanup, and then divide the meatloaf mixture between the muffin tins. I like to use about 1/4 cup of meatloaf mixture for each muffin tin, which ends up being about 3/4 full on each muffin tin. You should get about 18 meatloaf bites out of the recipe.\n4 Bake the bites: Place the meatloaf-packed muffin tins in the oven and bake for about 20 minutes.\n5 Make the glaze: Stir together the barbecue sauce, brown sugar and, if using, hot sauce in a small bowl. After the bites have baked for 20 minutes, remove and brush the glaze right on the meatloaf tops.\n6 Finish baking: Return to the oven and bake for another 10 minutes until meatloaf bites are cooked through. If you have a meat thermometer handy, the meatloaf bites should reach an internal temperature of 160\xc2\xb0F.\n7 Serve! Remove meatloaf bites once they have cooled slightly and serve with steamed veggies and potatoes. The meatloaf bites should hold together easily and not crumble.\n8 Make the Dad Add Sub with the leftovers: Heat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. Cut open a soft French sub roll and slather on a few tablespoons of marinara sauce. Top with provolone cheese, a few meatloaf bites cut in half, and a few banana peppers.\nBake the sub for 6 to 7 minutes until it\xe2\x80\x99s the edges are crispy and the cheese is melted and bubbling.

Cilantro loves cool temperatures and should be stored in the refrigerator. Parsley can be stored at room temperature or in the refrigerator. According to Harold McGee, basil is ideally stored at room temperature and not in the refrigerator, because it is susceptible to damage from cold.\n5 Change the water after several days if the water starts to discolor.\nFresh parsley, cilantro, basil, and other fresh herbs can last up to 2 weeks or longer when stored this way.\nHello!

b"Print\nCaprese Corn Salad Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nMany recipes I've found online for corn and tomato salad just use raw corn, freshly shucked and the kernels scraped off. I prefer it with grilled corn, but if you have particularly fresh corn that tastes great raw, feel free to use it here.\nNeither tomatoes nor basil do well refrigerated, so this salad is best made fresh and eaten immediately.\nINGREDIENTS\n5 to 6 ears of sweet corn (still in husks, do not shuck)\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n3 Tbsp sherry vinegar or white wine vinegar\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon sugar (optional)\n3 cups roughly chopped, seeded tomatoes, or halved cherry or sun gold tomatoes\n1/2 cup sliced scallions, including light green parts\n8 ounces fresh mozzarella, cut into 1/4-inch cubes\n1/2 cup to 1 cup of fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced\nMETHOD\n1 Grill the corn: Prepare your grill for high, direct heat. Place the corn cobs still in their husks directly on the grill. Cook for 15 minutes or so, turning every few minutes, so that the husks get completely charred. The corn will steam in the husks. There is no need to soak the corn in water first if the corn is fresh.\nIf you want some char on the corn itself, remove a few of the outer corn husks first, so there is less of a protective layer around the corn.\nOnce the husks are completely charred, remove from the grill and let cool for a few minutes. Then remove the husks and silk.\nTo remove the corn from the cob, stand the shucked cob upright in shallow baking pan or rimmed dish. Hold the cob steady in one hand, and with the other hand use a sharp knife to make downward strokes on the cob, separating the kernels from the cob.\nAlternatively, if you have frozen corn kernels, you can use them for this salad (4 cups). Just heat a large cast iron pan on medium high to high heat. Put a layer of frozen corn directly on the pan, do not defrost first. Once the corn has browned on one side, stir and let the corn brown some more. Then remove to cool.\n2 Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, vinegar, salt, and freshly ground black pepper to taste. Adding sugar will depend on how sweet your corn or tomatoes are, so you may want to withhold sugar until the end and add to taste.\n3 Toss together the corn, tomatoes, scallions, cheese, and dressing: In a large bowl, toss together the corn, tomatoes, scallions, Mozzarella, and the dressing. Adjust seasonings to taste. Let sit for 10 minutes.\n4 Add basil: Right before serving, stir in the freshly sliced basil.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

If you don't have a copper mug, you can make it in a regular glass\xe2\x80\x94just make sure it's around 16 ounces for the best results!\nThis drink is also very good with tequila, should you feel so inclined.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 ounces vodka\n4 or 5 strawberries (5 for medium-to-large strawberries, 4 for truly enormous ones)\n5 basil leaves\n3/4 ounce fresh-squeezed lime juice\nCrushed ice\n2 to 3 ounces ginger beer, or to top\nSpecial equipment:\nCocktail shaker or mixing glass with Hawthorne strainer\nMuddler or spoon\n16 ounce copper mug (strongly recommended)\nTea strainer (optional)\nMETHOD\n1 Muddle the strawberries and basil: Add strawberries and basil to the bottom of a shaker. Pour the lime juice on top, then muddle them with a muddler or the back of a spoon. Do this enough to gently smoosh the strawberries, but not completely pulverize them.\n2 Add the vodka and shake: Add the vodka to the shaker, then the ice. (I find that 4 or 5 large cubes per drink works well.) Cover and shake for about 30 seconds.\n3 Strain: Strain directly into a copper mug full of crushed ice or double strain by pouring the drink through a tea strainer, which will catch the finer particles. A single strain is also fine.\n4 Add ginger beer: Fill the cup with ginger beer. Drink on a patio in the sunshine!\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Bring a large pot of water to a boil seasoned with salt. (I usually add 1 tablespoon kosher salt per 2 quarts of water)\nOnce boiling, add the kale and basil to the pot for only 10 seconds. Use the tongs to lift the kale and basil out of the water and let cool on a baking sheet. If it looks like an excessive amount of water remains on the greens, feel free to press them with a paper towel.\nUse this same pot of water to cook your pasta.\n2 Make the pesto: Add the blanched kale and basil to a blender or food processor with garlic, walnuts, 1/3 cup water, olive oil, and salt. Blend until pureed into a paste. Taste and adjust seasoning to your liking. If the pesto needs more liquid, add water, 1-2 tablespoons at a time, until it reaches your desired consistency.\n2 Boil the pasta: Add rotini pasta to the water you used to blanch the vegetables. Cook until al dente according to package. Reserve 1 cup pasta water and drain the pasta.\nReturn the pasta to the pot and add all the pesto. Stir to combine. If the pesto seems really dry, add reserved pasta water a little at a time. Stir between each addition until it coats the pasta well.\n3 Serve: Serve pesto rotini with grated parmesan cheese on top.\n4 For the Lemon Pepper Chicken: Season the chicken cutlets liberally with lemon pepper and salt.\nIn a medium skillet over medium heat, add olive oil and cook cutlets for 5 to 6 minutes per side until they reach an internal temperature of 165\xcb\x9aF.

b'Save It Print\nBarbecued Chicken on the Grill Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 45 minutesYield: Serves 4-6\nChicken thighs and legs will hold up better to long, slow cooking than will breasts which can more easily dry out. If you barbecue breasts, keep them on the coolest part of the grill (or follow this method).\nThis recipe assumes fairly large chicken pieces (like the main pieces from a 4 to 5 pound whole chicken). If you are working with smaller chicken pieces, they may require a shorter cooking time. If you are cooking wings, they too may be done before the other larger pieces.\nA note about the skin. Even if you do not plan on eating the chicken skin, it\'s still best to barbecue it with it on. The skin will protect the chicken pieces from drying out.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 pounds of your favorite chicken parts (legs, thighs, wings, breasts), skin-on\nSalt\nExtra virgin olive oil or vegetable oil\n1 cup barbecue sauce, store-bought or homemade\nMETHOD\n1 Oil and salt chicken pieces: Coat the chicken pieces with olive oil and sprinkle salt over them on all sides.\n2 Prepare grill: Prepare one side of your grill for high, direct heat. If you are using charcoal or wood, make sure there is a cool side to the grill where there are few to no coals.\n3 Sear chicken on hot side of grill, move to cool side: Lay the chicken pieces skin side down on the hottest side of the grill in order to sear the skin side well. Grill uncovered for 5-10 minutes, depending on how hot the grill is (you do not want the chicken to burn).\nOnce you have a good sear on one side, turn the chicken pieces over and move them to the cooler side of the grill.\nIf you are using a gas grill, maintain the flame on only one side of the grill, and move the chicken pieces to the cooler side, not directly over the flame. Reduce the temp to low or medium low (between 250\xc2\xb0F and 275\xc2\xb0F, no more than 300\xc2\xb0F).\nCover the grill and cook undisturbed for 20-30 minutes.\n4 Turn over and baste with barbecue sauce: Turn the chicken pieces over and baste them with with your favorite barbecue sauce. Cover the grill again and allow to cook for another 15-20 minutes.\nRepeat, turning the chicken pieces over, basting them with sauce, covering, and cooking for another 10-30 minutes.\nNOTE that timing will depend on your grill set-up, the size of your chicken pieces, and how cold your chicken pieces are to start with! If you are grilling smaller pieces of chicken on a charcoal grill, they may be done much earlier. The goal is to maintain a low enough grill temp so that the chicken cooks "low and slow".\n5 Finish with a sear or remove from heat when done: The chicken is done when the internal temperature of the chicken pieces are 160\xc2\xb0F for breasts and 170\xc2\xb0F for thighs, when tested with a meat thermometer.\nOr if you insert the tip of a knife into the middle of the thickest piece and the juices should run clear, the chicken is done.\nIf the chicken isn\'t done, turn the pieces over and continue to cook at a low temperature.\nIf you want, you can finish with a sear on the hot side of the grill. To do this, put the pieces, skin side down, on the hot side of the grill. Allow them to sear and blacken slightly for a minute or two.\n6 Paint with more barbecue sauce to serve.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nBarbecued Pork Shoulder on a Gas Grill Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hourCook time: 8 hoursYield: Serves 6-8\nNote that this cooking time is for a 4-pound Boston butt pork shoulder. A general rule on barbecued pork is to cook it at about 215\xc2\xb0F to 225\xc2\xb0F for 90 minutes per pound.\nIf using a rub, you\'ll need to get the rub on the night before and refrigerate.\nCooking a 4 pound roast, allowing time for the barbecue to heat up and for the meat to rest once done, can easily take 9 hours, so start early in the morning if you want to have the roast done in time for dinner.\nYou need to keep smoke on the meat for at least 4 hours for a 4 pound roast. If the roast isn\'t done after 6 hours, finish it in the oven, wrapped tightly in foil to hold in the moisture.\nTwo rub recipes are provided here. Pick one for a 4 pound roast, or if barbecuing two roasts, try one each.\nINGREDIENTS\nOne 4 pound pork shoulder roast, preferably Boston butt, boneless or bone-in (you can easily make two 4 pound roasts in about the same amount of time if your grill is big enough to accommodate them both)\n5 to 6 cups of wood chips, hickory, oak, apple, or other fruit wood\nBBQ Rub (enough for a 4 pound roast)\n2 Tbsp brown sugar, packed\n2 Tbsp white sugar\n2 Tbsp paprika\n1 Tbsp kosher salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin\n1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder\n1 1/2 teaspoons chipotle chile powder\n1 1/2 teaspoons black pepper\nSanta Maria Rub (enough for a 4 pound roast)\n1 Tbsp salt\n1 Tbsp finely ground black pepper\n1 Tbsp garlic powder\n1 Tbsp onion powder\n1 teaspoon cayenne\n1 Tbsp dried oregano\n1 teaspoon dry rosemary (or fresh, finely minced)\n1/2 teaspoon dry sage\n1/4 teaspoon sugar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nThe day before:\n1. Prepare the rub. Mix all the ingredients for the rub together, breaking up any clumps. Taste the rub as you make it and see if you like the taste, adjust accordingly.\n2. Rub the roast with the rub. Unwrap the pork roast and place it on its butcher paper or in a roasting pan, something that can catch the rub. With your (clean) hands work the rub mixture into the pork shoulder all over, including inside any crevasses you may find in a boneless roast where the bone had been. Be generous with the amount of rub.\nRewrap it in the butcher paper or wrap it in plastic and place it in a pan (to catch any liquid that may drip out), and refrigerate it overnight.\nThe night before:\n3. Soak the wood chips. Take 3 or 4 large handfuls of wood chips (hickory, oak, apple or other fruit wood) and place them in a bowl and cover them with water to soak them overnight (can also do for an hour before using).\nI think it helps to have a mix of sizes, from small chips to larger (1-inch x 2-inch) chunks. The smaller chips will get smoking more quickly, but will burn out more quickly too. The larger chunks will take longer to catch, but last well past when the smaller chips have burned themselves out.\nThe Day Of:\n4. Bring the chilled roast to room temp. 1 to 2 hours before you start the barbecue, take the pork out of the refrigerator to come to room temperature.\nNow, if you forget to do this, which I have done, you can still go ahead and BBQ it. You\'ll likely be finishing it in the oven anyway. It will just take a bit longer to cook.\n5. Prepare your grill. Remove one of the grill grates. This will be your "hot" side, where the wood chips will go. The other side of the grill will be the "cool" side, and where the meat will be, away from direct heat.\nDepending on the structure of your grill, you may want to remove the "flavor bar", the thin metal piece with lots of holes in it that sits over the burner. The wood chips will smoke more easily if they lay in a (fireproof metal or foil) container directly on the burner.\n6. Place a tray of water on the grill: If there is room on your grill, place a small aluminum tray of water on the grill to help moderate the heat and help keep the roast from getting too dry. A good place to place this is on an upper rack if you grill has one.\n7. Get the grill smoking. Create a double layered aluminum foil boat with a handful or two of damp wood chips in it.\nPlace the boat directly on the burner on the "hot" side of the grill if you can (otherwise place on the flavor bar). Turn the grill on to medium flame, cover the grill and let it heat up until the the wood chips start smoking.\nYou\'ll either see smoke coming out of the grill, or if you raise the lid, you\'ll see smoke coming out of the wood chip boat. You should see and smell the smoke.\nYou\'ll be replenishing the wood chips periodically for the next several hours so put more dry chips into water to soak if needed.\n8. Cook roast on cool side of grill, fat side up: Once the grill is smoking, place the roast on the grill grates on the cool side of the grill, away from direct heat. If your grill has a hot spot, position the roast away from it. If there is a fatty side to the meat, put that side facing up; the fat will render over time and baste the pork.\nCover the grill, lower the flame, and let the cooking begin. The temperature you want to maintain ideally is 225\xc2\xb0F. Try to keep it close to that temperature, within a range of 210\xc2\xb0F to 240\xc2\xb0F. If the temperature goes too high, the roast may dry out. If it\'s too low, it will take forever to cook.\n9. Maintain the smoke and the 225\xc2\xb0F temperature. This is the tricky part. You will want to maintain smoke in the grill for at least 4 hours (6 hours for a bigger roast). You will also want to maintain a cooking temperature of around 225\xc2\xb0. So, you have to check the grill!\nCheck if the temperature is being maintained between 210\xc2\xb0F and 240\xc2\xb0F, and check to make sure the chips are still producing smoke, every half hour. About once an hour you will likely need to replenish the chip boat with more wood chips.\nResist the temptation to open the grill more than once an hour. Every time you open the grill the inside temperature drops and you increase your overall cooking time.\nI found the best way to check the temperature, since I don\'t have a gauge in the grill itself, is to put an instant read meat thermometer into an opening in the hood on the meat side (cool side) of the grill, and just keep checking it. Make sure sensor tip of the probe is not touching the meat itself.\nYou want to avoid opening up the hood too often, because every time you do that, you lose heat. Of course, if your gas grill gets too hot, opening the hood can cool it down quickly.\nExpect a minimum cooking time, if you have been diligent at maintaining a 225\xc2\xb0F, of 90 minutes per pound. So if you are cooking a 4 pound roast, total cooking time will be at least 6 hours (and easily more). An 8 pound roast will take at least 12 hours of cooking time.\nIf you want to cook 8 pounds of pork shoulder more quickly, I recommend starting with two 4 pound roasts, spaced on the grill a few inches apart, which will cook in just a little more time than an 8 pound roast.\n10 Reposition the roast: After 2 or 3 hours, during one of your hourly opening of the grill to refresh the wood chips, reposition the roast so that the side that was closest to the heat is now furthest from the heat.\n11. Test internal temperature of meat. After about 5 hours, start taking the pork\'s internal temperature: You can eat it at 165\xc2\xb0F, but if you are making pulled pork the meat needs to be ideally 195\xc2\xb0F.\n12 Remove from heat, let rest: When the meat reaches 195\xc2\xb0F, remove it from the heat, tent it loosely with foil over a cutting board (to catch the juices) and let it rest for at least 30 minutes, and preferably 1 hour.\nIf after 6 hours of cooking, if the meat hasn\'t reached 195\xc2\xb0 internal temp (usually after 6 hours, the internal temp on my roasts is about 155\xc2\xb0F), my recommendation is to remove it from the grill and finish in the oven.\nTo finish in the oven, wrap the roast in aluminum foil to help prevent it from drying out in the oven, and place it in a roasting pan, in a 300\xc2\xb0F oven.\nCook until the internal temperature of the roast reaches 195\xc2\xb0F. If your starting internal meat temperature is 150\xc2\xb0F or so, this can take anywhere from an hour to two hours.\nWhen it reaches temperature, remove the roast from the oven and let rest for at least 30 minutes, up to an hour.\n13. Pull the pork. Pull the pork with 2 forks. Only now do you add any barbecue sauce (and any accumulated juices) to the meat. Taste it first! It might not need sauce at all, and if it does, add only a little at a time. One of the biggest sins of barbecue is to over-sauce perfectly good meat.\nServe on a bun with or without sauce, and with or without coleslaw. Also great with grilled or raw pineapple.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nHow To Make Fast, No-Soak Beans in the Instant Pot\nCook time: 30 minutesYield: about 5 cups cooked beans\nDon\'t skip the olive oil. This helps reduce foam during cooking, which could clog the pressure valve on the pressure cooker.\nIf cooking red kidney beans, I recommend boiling the beans for about 10 minutes first to break down the lectins.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound dried beans (see below for cooking times for specific beans)\n8 cups water\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 to 2 teaspoons salt\n2 o 3 cloves peeled garlic, optional\n1 bay leaf, optional\nSpecial equipment:\n6- to 8-quart pressure cooker (I use a 6-quart Instant Pot)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Combine all ingredients in the pressure cooker. Do not fill the pressure cooker more than half full.\n2 Secure the lid. Make sure the pressure regulator valve is closed. (On an Instant Pot, this means it will be set to the the "sealing" position.)\n3 Cook the beans: Here are the cooking times for unsoaked beans in the Instant Pot. Cooking times will be similar for other electric pressure cookers; cooking time will be slightly less for stovetop pressure cookers. Double-check the manual that came with your pressure cooker for more exact cooking times:\nBlack beans: 20 to 25 minutes\nBlack-eyed peas : 20 to 25 minutes\nGreat Northern beans: 25 to 30 minutes\nNavy beans: 25 to 30 minutes\nPinto beans: 25 to 30 minutes\nCannellini beans: 35 to 40 minutes\nChickpeas (garbanzo beans): 35 to 40 minutes\nRed kidney beans: 25-30 minutes (boil for 10 minutes before pressure cooking)\nCook beans at high pressure for the time recommended above. The pressure cooker will take 15 to 20 minutes to come to full pressure before cooking begins.\n4 Let the pressure release: Once cooking is complete, you can let the pressure release naturally on its own, which takes about 20 to 30 minutes, or you can do a "quick release" by opening the pressure valve on the top of the pressure cooker. If doing a rapid release, be careful because the bean liquid sometimes foams into the valve.\nI recommend letting the pressure release naturally for as long as you\'re able before the beans are needed. This helps the beans retain their shape and avoids the bean liquid foaming.\nWhat to do if your beans aren\'t quite done: Put the lid back on the pressure cooker and make sure the release valve is set back to "sealing." Cook at high pressure for another 5 to 10 minutes (depending on if you think your beans need just a little more time or a little more time to finish). The pot will quickly come back up to pressure because the contents are already hot. Check your beans after the extra cooking time and continue cooking for longer if needed.\n5 Using and storing your beans: The beans can be strained and used right away, or cooled and stored in their cooking liquid. They will keep for up to a week refrigerated or up to 3 months in the freezer.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Save It Print\nSlow Cooked Boston Baked Beans Recipe\nCook time: 8 hoursYield: Serves 5-6 as a main dish or 10-12 as a side\nWhy pre-soak the beans? You don't have to (see this great Russ Parsons article in the LA Times about why you don't need to soak beans), but not doing so in this recipe will increase the cooking time. With the beans pre-soaked, they'll still take 8 hours to cook and soften in a slow-cooker. Once beans come in contact with the molasses, the sugar in the molasses will keep the beans firm. That's why they take so long to cook.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound (2 to 2 1/4 cups) dry white beans such as Navy beans or Great Northern beans (can also use kidney beans)\n1/3 cup molasses\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n3-4 Tbsp Dijon mustard\n1/8 teaspoon ground cloves\n3 cups hot water\n1/2 pound salt pork (can sub bacon), cut into 1/2-inch to 1-inch pieces\n1 medium onion, (1 1/2 cups) chopped\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Soak beans in water: Place beans in a large pot and cover with 2 inches of water. Soak overnight and drain. Alternatively, bring a pot with the beans covered with 2 inches of water to a boil, remove from heat and let soak for a hour, then drain.\n2 Mix molasses, brown sugar, mustard, ground cloves with water: Whisk together the molasses, brown sugar, mustard, and ground cloves with 3 cups of hot water.\n3 Add ingredients to slow-cooker, layering them, starting with the salt pork: Line the bottom of a slow-cooker (or a Dutch oven if you are cooking in the oven) with half of the salt pork (pick the fattiest pieces). Layer over with half of the drained beans. Add all of the chopped onion in a layer.\nTop with another layer of beans and the remaining salt pork. Pour the molasses water mixture over the beans to just cover the beans.\n4 Slow cook until beans are tender: Cover and cook in a slow-cooker on the low setting for 8 hours (or in a 250\xc2\xb0F oven), until the beans are tender. Check the water level a few hours in, and if the beans need more water, add some. Add additional salt to taste if needed.\nNote that fresher beans will cook faster than older beans. Your beans may be ready in less than 8 hours, or they may take longer. Best the next day.\nServe with Boston brown bread.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

If you don't have time to soak beans overnight, you can put the beans into a pot of water, bring the water to a boil, remove from heat, and let sit for hour, and then drain. Pre-soaking the beans will help them cook faster.\nIf you would rather work with canned beans, use 3 to 4 15-ounce cans of drained white beans and cook them in step 3 for only 15 minutes, not an hour.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound dry Great Northern white beans, covered with a couple inches of water and soaked overnight\n5 ounces of bacon, cut into 1/2-inch wide pieces\n2 cups chopped onion (1 large onion)\n3/4 cup chopped celery (about 2 ribs of celery)\n3/4 cup chopped carrots (1 large carrot)\n3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)\n6 cups chicken stock\n2 bay leaves\n1 Tbsp fresh thyme\n2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n3 Tbsp tomato paste\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n1 ounce bacon (1 to 2 slices), cooked and crumbled for garnish (optional)\n2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Drain the beans: Drain the beans that have been soaking in water. (If you haven't already soaked the beans, and you don't have time to do so overnight, you can put them in a large pot of water, bring to a boil, remove from heat and let sit for an hour, then drain.)\n2 Cook the bacon and vegetables: Put the bacon into a large (5 to 6 quart) thick-bottomed Dutch oven on medium high heat. Let the bacon cook for a minute or two to start rendering out some of its fat, then add the chopped onion, celery, and carrots.\nLower the heat to low, cover and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, until vegetables are completely cooked through and softened. Add the garlic and cook a minute more.\n3 Add beans, stock, seasonings, simmer: Add the drained beans to the pot. Add the stock, the bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper.\nIncrease heat to high to bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour or until the beans are very soft.\n4 Add tomato paste and paprika: Stir in the tomato paste and the paprika. Cook for 5 more minutes.\n5 Pur\xc3\xa9e half the soup: Remove the bay leaves. Using an immersion blender, pur\xc3\xa9e most of the soup. You don't want the soup to be perfectly smooth, but you want to pur\xc3\xa9e enough of it so that the beans create a creamy base.\nAdd more salt and pepper to taste.\nGarnish with crumbled cooked bacon and chopped parsley to serve.\nHello!

You can also start with three 15-ounce cans of whole black beans, in which case, skip to step 5, rinse and drain the beans and add to the pan with a little water in step 6.\nINGREDIENTS\nIngredients for cooking the dry beans:\n1 pound dry black beans\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/2 large white onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)\n1 garlic clove, minced\n2 teaspoons salt\n1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro (leaves and tender stems)\nAdditional ingredients for frying the beans after they've been cooked:\n1 teaspoon chipotle chili powder\n1 teaspoon chili powder\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/2 large white onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)\n1 garlic clove, minced\nGreen onion\nCilantro\nCrumbled cotija or queso fresco cheese (omit for vegan version)\nTortilla chips or corn tortillas\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Soak dry beans: Place dry black beans in a bowl and add enough water to cover the beans by two inches. Let sit overnight.\nAlternatively, if you don't have time to soak the beans overnight, place the dry beans in a large bowl and pour boiling water over the beans, covering the beans with at least an inch of water, and let sit for one hour.\nNote, if your dry beans are a little old, or if you have reason to believe that they will be tough to cook (beans stored in hot or humid climates can get tough), you can add some salt to the water (1 1/2 teaspoons of salt 2 quarts of water) which at this stage will help the beans soften when they cook later.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 cumin, onion, garlic:  Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large thick-bottomed pot (the pot you will use to cook the beans) on medium high heat.\nAdd the cumin. Once the cumin is sizzling, add the chopped onion. Cook for 5 minutes or so, until translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for a minute more.\n3 Add drained beans and water, simmer 2 hours: Once the beans have soaked, they should have expanded noticeably. Drain the soaking liquid.\nAdd the drained beans and 2 quarts of water to the onions. Bring to a simmer. Partially cover the pot and lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Simmer for 2 hours.\n4 Add Salt and Cilantro, cook 30 min more: After the beans have simmered for 2 hours, add 2 teaspoons of salt (if you salted the soaking water in step 1, then taste first, and only add a teaspoon or so more of salt if you think it needs it).\nAdd 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro. Let cook uncovered for another half hour, or until the beans are tender.\n5 Saut\xc3\xa9 the spices, then add onions and cook: Heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil in a large frying pan on medium high heat. Add the chipotle powder, chili powder, and cumin.\nOnce the spices are sizzling, add the chopped white onion and cook until translucent.\nAdd the garlic and cook a minute more.\n6 Add beans, then mash: Add the cooked black beans (and liquid from the pot) to the frying pan. Use a potato masher to mash the beans in the pan.  Let them cook 3 to 4 minutes longer.\nIf the beans are a little soupy for your taste, just let them cook longer. If too thick or dry, add more water. Adjust seasonings to taste.\n7 Serve: Garnish with chopped green onions, fresh cilantro, and crumbled cotija or queso fresco cheese.\nServe with tortilla chips or corn or flour tortillas (corn if you are gluten-free). Great in tacos or burritos, or for a dip, or a side with steak.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Save It Print\nCoconut Rice and Beans Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 6-8\nThe chile is cooked whole with the rice and is there just for a bit of flavor. It doesn't make the rice hot at all, as it stays whole and you discard it at the end.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 Tbsp vegetable oil\n1/2 yellow onion, chopped\n4 garlic cloves, chopped\n2 cups long-grain rice\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger\n1 cup water\n1 cup chicken stock (or vegetable stock for vegetarian option)\n2 cups coconut milk\n1 15-ounce can kidney beans, rinsed and drained, or 1 1/2 cups cooked kidney beans\n2 teaspoons dried thyme\n1 whole Scotch bonnet chile (can substitute a whole habanero)\nLime (optional)\nMETHOD\n1 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions: Heat the oil in a medium pot over medium-high heat. Add the onions and saut\xc3\xa9 for 4-5 minutes, until they begin to brown on the edges.\n2 Add garlic and rice: Add the garlic and rice, stir well and cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring often.\n3 Add remaining ingredients: Add the grated ginger, salt, water, stock and coconut milk and stir well. Add the kidney beans and sprinkle the thyme over everything. Add the whole Scotch bonnet chile (or habanero); it will season the rice much like a bay leaf would.\n4 Cook: Bring to a simmer, then turn the heat to low and cover. The rice should be done in about 15-20 minutes, depending on the type of rice you are using (some long grained rice takes longer to cook). Check after 15 minutes.\n5 Remove from heat, cover: Once done, remove from heat and cover for 10 minutes.\n6 Serve: Fluff with a fork. Sprinkle with a little lime juice if you want. Discard the habanero (or eat it, if you dare!)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"
b'Print\nQuick and Easy White Bean Salad Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesYield: Serves 4\nYou can easily double or quadruple the recipe to serve a larger group.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 14.5-ounce can white beans, drained but not rinsed\n2 tablespoons chopped red onion\nA squeeze of lemon juice\n2 teaspoons wine vinegar (red or white)\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon dry Herbs de Provence (crumbled) OR 1 teaspoon of some combination of finely chopped rosemary, tarragon, thyme, and lavender\nSalt and freshly ground pepper to taste\nMETHOD\n1 Let the onion marinate in lemon juice: After you chop up the onion, squeeze a little lemon juice over it and let it sit while prepping the other ingredients.

b"Print\nMexican Quinoa Salad with Black Beans, Corn, and Tomatoes Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 4-6\nIf you are working with frozen corn, you can add more flavor by taking the frozen corn kernels and searing them directly on a hot pan, without defrosting first. Save time by prepping most of the ingredients while the quinoa is cooking.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup uncooked quinoa, well rinsed\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 cups water\n1/3 cup diced red onion\n2 Tbsp lime juice\n1 15-ounce can black beans, drained and rinsed\n1 cup frozen corn, defrosted, OR 1 cup of fresh corn, parboiled, drained and cooled (approximately the amount of kernels from one ear of corn)\n3 medium tomatoes, seeded and cut into chunks\n5 ounces Queso fresco, Queso Panela, fresh Mozzarella or other mild farmer's cheese, cut into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch cubes\n1 jalape\xc3\xb1o, seeded and finely chopped\n1/4 cup chopped cilantro, including tender stems, packed\n3 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil\nMETHOD\n1 Cook the quinoa: Put the rinsed quinoa, salt and water into a pot and bring it to a boil.

b'Save It Print\nPressure Cooker Baked Beans Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCooking (including pressure release) time: 2 hoursYield: 8 to 10 servings\nThis recipe uses an electric pressure cooker. Pressure cooking times will be slightly less if you\'re using a stovetop pressure cooker.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound dried Great Northern beans\n1/3 cup molasses\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n3 tablespoons Dijon mustard\n1/8 teaspoon ground cloves\n8 ounces bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 medium onion, diced\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart electric pressure cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Par-cook the beans: Combine the dried beans and 8 cups of the water in an electric pressure cooker. Secure the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure that the pressure regulator is set to the \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d position.\nIf you are using an Instant Pot, select the \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, then adjust the time to 15 minutes. If your pressure does not have a \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, set it manually to \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Pressure\xe2\x80\x9d for 15 minutes.\nIt will take about 20 minutes for your pressure cooker to come up to pressure, and then the 15 minutes of actual cooking will begin. \n2 Naturally release the pressure and drain the beans: When the timer goes off, wait for the pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes, then release the rest of the pressure by moving the pressure release knob from \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cVenting.\xe2\x80\x9d It will take a minute or two for the pressure to release completely.\nAt this point, the beans should be mostly cooked through, but still firm. It\'s fine if there\'s still a little bit of white at the center. If you\'d like to use some of the bean cooking liquid to make your baked beans, scoop out 1 1/2 cups of liquid and set it aside.\nWearing a pair of heat-proof mitts, lift the inner pot out of the pressure cooker and drain the beans into a colander in the sink. Wash out the pot and return it to the pressure cooker.\n3 Prepare the cooking liquid: In a small bowl, whisk together the molasses, sugar, mustard, ground cloves, and 1 1/2 cups water or reserved bean cooking liquid. Set aside.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 the bacon and onions: Reset the electric pressure cooker, then select its \xe2\x80\x9cSaut\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d program. Add the bacon to the pot and saut\xc3\xa9 it until it begins to render some fat, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the onions and saut\xc3\xa9 until they are translucent, about 5 more minutes. When done, hit "Cancel" to stop saut\xc3\xa9ing.\n5 Finish cooking the beans: Gently stir the beans and the cooking liquid into the pot with the bacon and onions. Secure the lid on the pressure cooker, again making sure that the pressure regulator is set to the \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d position.\nIf you are using an Instant Pot, select the \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, then adjust the time to 15 minutes. If your pressure does not have a \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, set it manually to \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Pressure\xe2\x80\x9d for 15 minutes.\nIt will take about 15 minutes for your pressure cooker to come up to pressure, and then the 15 minutes of actual cooking will begin.\n6 Let the pressure release naturally: When the cooking program finishes, let the pressure cooker completely release its pressure naturally. This will take about 30 minutes.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t perform a quick release, as the thick cooking liquid will sputter out of the pressure release valve.\n7 Serve the beans warm: They are very good straight out of the pot, and taste even better the next day. Reheat beans over low temperature on the stovetop, in a low oven, or in the microwave.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Feel free to double to Ree's original Thanksgiving-worthy proportions.\nThis recipe also works well in the slow cooker, so I've added instructions for that as well.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 slices thick cut bacon (about 4 ounces), cut into 1-inch segments\n1/2 large onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)\n1 clove garlic, minced\n1 pounds of fresh, firm green beans (they should break when you bend them, not bend like a rubber band), stem ends trimmed\n1 14.5-ounce can whole tomatoes\n1 large sprig fresh thyme\nSalt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the bacon until fat begins to render: Place the bacon pieces on the bottom of a large, thick-bottomed pot. Heat on medium heat for several minutes until the bacon fat begins to render.\n2 Add onions, then garlic: Add the chopped onions to the bacon. Cook a few minutes until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic (if using) and cook a minute more. Drain off any excess fat.\n3 Add green beans, tomatoes, spices: Add the green beans to the pot. Add the whole, peeled, canned tomatoes and their juices. Add a sprig of thyme to the pot (if using). Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and cayenne.\n4 Cover and simmer: Cover the pot and lower the heat to low. Simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the beans are cooked through and tender, stirring occasionally.\nSlow Cooker Instructions If you want to use a slow cooker for step 4, you can easily do so. Just put the cooked bacon and onions from steps 1 and 2, and the beans, tomatoes and spices into a slow cooker and cook on high for 2 to 3 hours, depending on your slow cooker, until the beans are completely tender and the tomatoes have broken down.\nServe!\nHello!

Add salt if needed. If it needs more acid or tastes slightly bitter, add more lemon juice one teaspoon at a time. If the dressing is too thick, add more water a tablespoon at a time.\nDressing can be made several days ahead and kept refrigerated. You may need to allow it to warm slightly at room temperature (or very briefly in the microwave) to loosen it up before using.\n2 Warm the chickpeas: Drain chickpeas and rinse well in a colander. Rub the chickpeas gently with a clean, lint-free towel to dry, or let them air dry for about 10 minutes. When dry, toss the chickpeas in a mixing bowl with the paprika, cumin, coriander, salt, pepper. Add 1/2 tablespoon of the olive oil and mix until well-coated.\nWarm a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot enough that a drop of water sizzles on contact. Add the remaining 1/2 tablespoon of olive oil and tilt the pan to evenly coat.\nImmediately add the chickpeas. Stir constantly until they are warmed through, 3 to 5 minute). Turn off heat, then add garlic and chili (if using), and mix well.\nToss with fresh herbs just before serving. (The chickpeas are best if served while still warm, but are also good if you make them ahead and serve cold.)\n3 Assemble the bowls: Divide the spinach evenly between four bowls. Top each bowl with 1/2 cup of the brown rice, 1/2 cup warm chickpeas, a quarter of the tomatoes, a quarter of the cucumber, and a quarter of the red onion.

An extra step, but worth it if you have the time!\nTo brine the shrimp, mix together 4 cups water, 1/4 cup kosher salt (or 3 Tbsp table or sea salt), 1/4 cup white sugar until the salt and sugar have dissolved. Add one cup of ice and the shrimp. After 30 minutes (time it!) remove the shrimp and give them a quick rinse.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound 16-20 count shelled and deveined shrimp\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2 15-ounce cans cannellini white beans, rinsed and drained\n1 cup cherry tomatoes, halved or quartered\n1/2 cup finely diced red onion\n3/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest\n3 handfuls baby arugula leaves\nDressing:\n3 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil\n2 cloves minced garlic\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the shrimp: Heat a large cast iron skillet or griddle on high heat.

Place the beans in a large pot and cover with at least a couple of inches with cold water. Soak for at least 4 hours. (To do a quick soak, you can pour boiling water over the beans and cover by a couple of inches, and just soak for one hour instead of four.)\n2 Cook beans with aromatics: Drain the beans. Return the beans to the pot and add 3 quarts of water to the pot. Add 2 Tbsp olive oil, the sage leaves, 2 cloves crushed garlic, 3 teaspoons kosher salt, and the peppercorns. Cover, bring to a simmer on medium heat, and simmer beans for one hour. Lower the heat so that the beans are barely simmering. Cook for an additional 1-2 hours, or until beans are just tender. Note that the fresher the beans the shorter the cooking time, the older the beans the longer the cooking time. Remove from heat and let cool in cooking liquid. Set aside 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid, drain the rest from the beans.\nPreparing canned beans if using:\nTaste the liquid in the cans of beans. If it tastes good (and it should), drain the beans and reserve 1/2 a cup of the bean liquid. If the liquid doesn't taste good (which may happen if the can has been sitting around too long), discard the liquid and use 1/2 cup of water instead of the bean liquid in the next step.\nPreparing the beans and sausage:\n3 Cook the sausage: Heat one tablespoon of olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Remove sausages from their casings (if the sausage has come in casings), and cook in the skillet until lightly browned, about 3-4 minutes.\n4 Add the reserved bean cooking (or can) liquid, 4 Tbsp olive oil, garlic, chopped tomatoes, and red pepper flakes, stirring occasionally until slightly thickened, about 5 minutes.\n5 Add the reserved beans and tomato pur\xc3\xa9e. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Simmer a few minutes longer, stirring gently, until sausage is cooked through and the sauce has thickened. Be careful not to break up the beans.\nHello!

As you fill up a baking pan, put the pan in the oven to keep the tortillas warm.\nAdd more oil as needed. Carefully monitor the oil temperature. Don't let it get too hot, or the tortillas will burn, or too cool - they won't fry up crisp enough.\n3 Arrange toppings to serve: To serve, arrange the cheese, cilantro and tomatoes in separate small bowls. Put beans into a serving dish. Bring out the tortillas by batches, keeping the rest warm in the oven.\nLet people spread beans on to their tortillas and add sprinkle on the cheese, cilantro and tomatoes for each tostada.\nOptional additions are sliced lettuce, guacamole, sour cream, and salsa (though with the chipotle, you probably don't need any more heat).\nHello!

(If starting with raw chicken, see How to Poach Chicken).\nMix soy sauce, sherry and sugar in a bowl and add the chicken. Let soak for 10 minutes. Remove chicken and pat dry with paper towels.\n2 Fry the bean threads in hot oil: Put 3/4 inch of high smoke point cooking oil (such as canola oil or peanut oil) into a small saucepan. Heat on high heat until shimmering.\nTake one bunch of the dried bean threads and gently break them up a bit. Test the oil by putting one bean thread into the oil.\nIf the oil is hot enough, the bean thread will almost immediately sizzle and puff up. That's when you know the oil is hot enough.\nWhen the oil is ready, working with a few bean threads at a time, put them in the hot oil.\nAs soon as they puff up, remove them carefully with tongs and place them on a paper towel to cool. The paper towel helps remove any excess oil. Set aside.\n3 Fry the shredded chicken: In a large skillet over medium high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of oil from the bean threads until hot.\nAdd the chicken and cook for 2 to 3 minutes to bake in the seasoning. Set aside.\n4 Slice green onions lengthwise: Cut the green onions in 3 to 4 inch long pieces, and shred them lengthwise.\n5 Toast the chopped almonds and sesame seeds: Toast the chopped almonds, or chop your toasted almonds; toast your sesame seeds. (Heat a thin skillet to medium high heat, add the seeds - or nuts, don't do them both together - stir frequently until they begin to brown, remove from heat, they will continue to cook. Let cool to room temp.)\n6 Make the dressing: Put all of the dressing ingredients together in a jar\xe2\x80\x94sugar, salt, pepper, vegetable oil, dark sesame oil, rice vinegar\xe2\x80\x94cover with a lid and shake until emulsified.\n7 Serve: Just before serving the salad, mix all of the salad ingredients together - lettuce, chicken, bean threads, almonds, sesame seeds, and dressing.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nHow to Grill the Best Burgers\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 5 minutesYield: 6 burgers\nThis recipe will make six burgers that are 1/3 pound each. The patties should be 4-inches across and 1-inch thick at the edges before cooking.\nI like hamburgers with a bit of a garlic kick, so if you prefer a subtler garlic flavor, feel free to reduce the amount to your liking or eliminate altogether.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds 80/20 ground beef, cold\n4 cloves minced garlic\n2 tablespoons minced onion\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n1 3/4 teaspoons freshly ground pepper\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n6 hamburger buns\nButter for buns\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the burger mix: Put the cold ground beef in mixing bowl. Sprinkle the other ingredients evenly over top. Fold the meat over a few times to get everything incorporated. This entire process should only take about 30 to 45 seconds. Don\xe2\x80\x99t over handle the meat.\n  2 Shape the burger patties: Rather than forming the patties in your hand, form them on a tray. This makes it easier to shape the patties without over-handling or warming the meat. I like to use a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, but any tray or platter will do.\nOn the tray, divide the meat into 6 equal parts (about 5 1/4 ounces each). Gently form each portion into a patty that is 4-inches across with 1-inch sides and a shallow depression in the middle (see photos below). You want the outer 1/2 inch of the patty to be slightly taller than the inside. This keeps the patty from shrinking too much and from puffing up in the center during grilling\nCover the patties with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge while you heat up your grill and butter your buns.\n  3 Heat the grill: Heat a gas or charcoal grill to 450 to 500\xc2\xb0F, or hot enough that you can only hold your hand above the grill grates for about 1 second.\nButter the insides of all the buns and set them near the grill.\n4 Grill the burgers: Place patties on the grill over direct heat. Cook to your desired doneness:\nFor rare burgers, cook for 4 minutes total (125\xc2\xb0F)\nFor medium-rare burgers, cook for 5 minutes total (135\xc2\xb0F)\nFor medium burgers, cook for 6 to 7 minutes total (145\xc2\xb0F)\nFor well-done burgers, cook for 8 to 9 minutes total (160\xc2\xb0F)\nFlip the burgers at least once during cooking, or as often as you wish. Do not press down on the patties at any time.\n  5 Add the cheese and toast the buns: When you have about 1 minute left on the cooking time, add the cheese to the burgers and the buttered buns to the grill over indirect heat.\n6 Rest the burgers: Remove burgers and buns from grill and transfer to a clean platter. Let the burgers rest for 1 minute before serving.\n7 Serve: Serve with tomato jam, mayonnaise, bacon jam, garlic aioli, blue cheese sauce, saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms, Thousand Island, or the classic and always wonderful lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nGrilled Marinated Flank Steak Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 20 minutesMarinating time: 2 hoursYield: Serves 6\nINGREDIENTS\nMarinade Ingredients\n1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n2 tablespoon red wine vinegar\n1/3 cup soy sauce\n1/4 cup honey\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\nOther ingredients\n2 pounds flank steak\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Marinate the steak: Combine the marinade ingredients in a large non-reactive bowl.\nPlace steak in the bowl and turn so that it is completely coated with the marinade. (You can also place the steak and marinade in a freezer bag and place it in a bowl.)\nChill and marinate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\n2 Prepare your grill for high, direct heat with one part of the grill for lower, indirect heat. The grill is hot enough when you hold your hand about an inch over the hot side and you can only hold it there for about a second.\n3 Grill the steak: Remove the steak from the marinade and gently shake off the excess marinade from the steak (but make sure there is still a coating of it, you'll want the oil on it to help keep the steak from sticking to the grill).\nIf you want, sprinkle generously on all sides with coarse salt and freshly ground pepper. The salt and pepper will help form a savory crust on the steak.\nPlace steak on the hot side of the grill. Grill for a minute or two on each side to get a good sear, then move the steak to the cooler side of the grill, cover and cook a few minutes more until done to your liking.\nHow do you know when the steak is done? One way to tell is to poke it with your fingertips. While the steak is still raw, test it with your fingers; it will be quite squishy. That's what a very rare steak feels like. Touch the tip of your nose and that's what a very well done steak feels like. Here's a visual guide, the finger test to check the doneness of steak.\nOtherwise use a good meat thermometer (I recommend a thermapen.)  Pull the steak off the grill at 120 to 125\xc2\xb0F for rare, 130-140\xc2\xb0F for medium rare, and 145\xc2\xb0F for medium.\n4 Rest the steak: When the steak has cooked to your preferred level of doneness, remove from the grill and place on a cutting board. Cover with aluminum foil to hold in the heat while the steak rests for 10 to 15 minutes.\n5 Slice across the grain: Notice the direction of the muscle fibers of the steak; this is called the grain of the meat. Flank steak is a very lean cut that will be tough and chewy unless you cut it in a way that breaks up the muscle fibers.\nSo, cut the steak across the grain of the meat, at a steep diagonal, so that the slices are wide. I find it easiest to use a long serrated bread knife for this, but any long sharp knife will do.\nIf you want, you can take the excess marinade and bring it to a boil, simmer for several minutes, and serve with the flank steak. Great also with salsa or horseradish sauce.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"

You will use some of it for the marinade and some for the dipping sauce.\n2 Marinate the steak: Place the steak in a shallow dish. Pour 1/3 cup of the marinade over the steak and set the remaining marinade aside to use later as the dipping sauce.\nTurn the steak to coat it in the marinade. Let the steak marinate at room temperature for 30 minutes, turning the steak once or twice, or cover it and let the steak marinate for up to 24 hours in the refrigerator.\nIf you refrigerate the meat, let it come to room temperature before grilling.\n3 Cook the rice noodles: Follow the cooking directions on the package of noodles. (Individual manufacturers\xe2\x80\x99 instructions vary.) Drain the noodles in a colander and rinse under cold running water, tossing with your hands, to remove the excess starch and prevent the noodles from sticking together.\n4 Grill the steak: Light a charcoal grill or turn a gas grill to high (about 450\xc2\xbaF). Grill the steak for 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare (135\xc2\xbaF). The exact timing will depend upon the heat of the individual grill and the thickness of your steak.\nFor best results, use an instant read thermometer inserted into the center of the steak: 125\xc2\xbaF for rare, 135\xc2\xbaF for medium rare, 145\xc2\xbaF for medium.\n5 Rest and slice the steak: Transfer the steak to a cutting board, cover with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Thinly slice it across the grain.\n6 Arrange the ingredients on a platter: Tear the lettuce leaves into large pieces, removing the stiff stem ends.\nArrange the lettuce leaves, scallions, radish, cucumbers, peanuts, mint, and cilantro on a large platter around the sliced steak, rice noodles, and dipping sauce. This allows each person to build his or her own wrap.\n7 To make one wrap: Set a lettuce leaf on a plate. Place some rice noodles and steak slices over the leaf, and top with scallions, cilantro, mint, radishes, cucumbers, and peanuts. Roll or fold and serve with dipping sauce.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nCorned Beef and Cabbage Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 2 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 4 to 6\nCorned beef is cured in a salt mixture, so it can be very salty, depending on the source. We recommend first bringing the corned beef to a boil in plain water, and discarding the water, (repeat for less salt), before proceeding with the baked version.\nINGREDIENTS\nCorned Beef (baked)\n3 pounds corned beef (in package)\n10 whole cloves\n1/4 cup hot sweet honey mustard\n2 tablespoons brown sugar\nCorned Beef (boiled)\n3 pounds corned beef (in package, including spice packet)\nCabbage (saut\xc3\xa9ed)\nExtra virgin olive oil and butter\n1 medium yellow onion, chopped\n1 cloves garlic, minced\n1 large head of cabbage, sliced into 3/8-inch to 1/2-inch wide slices\nSalt\nCabbage (boiled)\n1 large head of cabbage, sliced into 3/8-inch to 1/2-inch wide slices\nAdditional vegetables such as a couple carrots (cut to 1 inch pieces) or several new potatoes (quartered)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nCorned Beef (Baked)\n1 Lightly boil to remove excess salt: Take the corned beef from the package and discard the spice packet. Note that one side of the roast should have a layer of fat, the other side should have distinct lines indicating the grain of the beef.\nCorned beef can be very salty, especially when baked. To remove some of the salt before cooking, place it in a pot fat side up. Cover with water, bring to a boil, and discard the water. Repeat to remove even more salt.\n2 Top with cloves, honey mustard, brown sugar: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Lay the corned beef, fat side up, on a large piece of heavy duty, wide, aluminum foil (you may have to get creative with the way you wrap the beef if your foil isn't wide enough).\nInsert the cloves into the top of the slab of corned beef, evenly spaced. Spread the top with the hot sweet honey mustard. Sprinkle brown sugar over the top.\n3 Wrap in foil and bake: Wrap the corned beef with foil in a way that allows for a little space on top between the corned beef and the foil, and creates a container to catch the juices. Place foil-wrapped corned beef in a shallow roasting pan and bake for 2 hours at 350\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Add more honey mustard, broil: Open the foil wrapping, spread a little more honey mustard over the top of the corned beef, and broil it for 2-3 minutes, until the top is bubbly and lightly browned.\n5 Slice: Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then place on cutting board. Pull out and discard the cloves.\nLift the corned beef up to see which direction the grain of the meat is.  Then cut the meat at a diagonal, across the grain of the meat, into 1/2-inch thick slices.\nServe immediately.\nCorned Beef (Boiled)\n1 Place corned beef in a large (6 to 8 quart) pot. Cover the beef with an inch water. Add the contents of the spice packet to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer.\nSimmer for 2-3 hours, until the corned beef is fork tender. Remove from pot to a cutting board. (Reserve cooking liquid for boiling cabbage, if you plan to boil and not saut\xc3\xa9 the cabbage.)\nCut slices across the grain, into 1/2-inch thick slices. Serve.\nCabbage (Saut\xc3\xa9ed)\n1 Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil (enough to well coat the pan) on medium high to high heat in a large, wide pot (8-quart if available) or large, high-sided saut\xc3\xa9 pan. Add chopped onions, cook for a couple of minutes, then add garlic.\n2 Add a third of the sliced cabbage to the pan. Sprinkle with a little salt and stir to coat with oil and mix with onions.\nSpread out the cabbage evenly over the bottom of the pan and do not stir until it starts to brown. If the heat is high enough, this should happen quickly. The trick is to have the burner hot enough to easily brown the cabbage, but not so hot that it easily burns.\nWhen the bottom of the cabbage is nicely browned, use a metal spatula to lift it up and flip it, scraping the browned bits as you go.\n3 Once the cabbage in the pan has browned on a couple of flips, add another third of the cabbage to the pan. Mix well, then spread out the cabbage and repeat. Add a bit of butter to the pan for flavor, and to keep the cabbage from sticking too much to the pan. Once this batch has cooked down a bit and browned, add the remaining third of the cabbage and repeat.\nServe with the corned beef. Serve with boiled new potatoes. Can be made ahead and reheated.\nCabbage (Boiled)\n1 Once you have removed the corned beef from the pot, add the cabbage and any other vegetables (carrots, new potatoes) to the pot. Taste the liquid. If it is too salty, add more water to the pot. Raise the heat until the liquid is simmering well. Simmer until the cabbage and any other vegetables are cooked through, 15-30 minutes.\nPlace vegetables in a serving bowl, add a little of the cooking liquid to the bowl.\nHello!

Cover with at least an inch of cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes).\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 vegetables: While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.\nIf you are including vegetables, add them according to their cooking time. Carrots should be cooked with the onions, because they take as long to cook as the onions do.\nIf you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time.\n3 Add the ground beef, then Worcestershire sauce and broth: Add ground beef to the pan with the onions and vegetables. Cook until no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper.\nAdd the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out.\n4 Mash the cooked potatoes: When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with the remaining 4 Tbsp of butter. Mash with a fork or potato masher, and season with salt and pepper to taste.\n5 Layer the meat mixture and mashed potatoes in a casserole dish: Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. Spread the beef, onions, and vegetables (if using) in an even layer in a large baking dish (9x13 casserole).\nSpread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef. Rough up the surface of the mashed potatoes with a fork so there are peaks that will get well browned. You can even use a fork to make creative designs in the mashed potatoes.\n6 Bake in oven: Place in a 400\xc2\xb0F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown.\n(Be careful when broiling using Pyrex or glass dishes, they have been known to shatter under the high heat of the broiler. It's not a worry if you are using a ceramic or metal casserole dish.)\nSuggested variations:\nPut a layer of creamed corn between the ground beef and the mashed potatoes.\nSprinkle grated cheddar cheese over the top of the mashed potatoes before baking.\nHello!

The patties should be 4-inches across and 1-inch thick at the edges before cooking.\nI like hamburgers with a bit of a garlic kick, so if you prefer a subtler garlic flavor, feel free to reduce the amount to your liking or eliminate altogether.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds 80/20 ground beef, cold\n4 cloves minced garlic\n2 tablespoons minced onion\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n1 3/4 teaspoons freshly ground pepper\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n6 hamburger buns\nButter for buns\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the burger mix: Put the cold ground beef in mixing bowl. Sprinkle the other ingredients evenly over top. Fold the meat over a few times to get everything incorporated. This entire process should only take about 30 to 45 seconds. Don\xe2\x80\x99t over handle the meat.\n  2 Shape the burger patties: Rather than forming the patties in your hand, form them on a tray. This makes it easier to shape the patties without over-handling or warming the meat. I like to use a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, but any tray or platter will do.\nOn the tray, divide the meat into 6 equal parts (about 5 1/4 ounces each). Gently form each portion into a patty that is 4-inches across with 1-inch sides and a shallow depression in the middle (see photos below). You want the outer 1/2 inch of the patty to be slightly taller than the inside. This keeps the patty from shrinking too much and from puffing up in the center during grilling\nCover the patties with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge while you heat up your grill and butter your buns.\n  3 Heat the grill: Heat a gas or charcoal grill to 450 to 500\xc2\xb0F, or hot enough that you can only hold your hand above the grill grates for about 1 second.\nButter the insides of all the buns and set them near the grill.\n4 Grill the burgers: Place patties on the grill over direct heat. Cook to your desired doneness:\nFor rare burgers, cook for 4 minutes total (125\xc2\xb0F)\nFor medium-rare burgers, cook for 5 minutes total (135\xc2\xb0F)\nFor medium burgers, cook for 6 to 7 minutes total (145\xc2\xb0F)\nFor well-done burgers, cook for 8 to 9 minutes total (160\xc2\xb0F)\nFlip the burgers at least once during cooking, or as often as you wish. Do not press down on the patties at any time.\n  5 Add the cheese and toast the buns: When you have about 1 minute left on the cooking time, add the cheese to the burgers and the buttered buns to the grill over indirect heat.\n6 Rest the burgers: Remove burgers and buns from grill and transfer to a clean platter. Let the burgers rest for 1 minute before serving.\n7 Serve: Serve with tomato jam, mayonnaise, bacon jam, garlic aioli, blue cheese sauce, saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms, Thousand Island, or the classic and always wonderful lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nRoast Beef Tenderloin with Saut\xc3\xa9ed Mushrooms Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: Serves 4\nBeef tenderloin is a beautiful, tender cut of beef and is what is used to make filet mignon. To make a roast from the tenderloin you can ask your butcher to cut a big center piece from a whole tenderloin, or purchase a whole tenderloin and cut it yourself for this purpose, saving the rest for filet mignon. You can find whole beef tenderloin at Costco or Sam's Club for a reasonable price.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 3/4 to 2 pound piece of beef tenderloin (preferably a piece cut from the center of the tenderloin), trimmed of excess fat and silverskin\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon coarse black pepper\n1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n  1 pound cremini mushrooms, sliced into 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick slices\n3 Tbsp butter\n1 teaspoon salt (use 1/2 teaspoon if using salted butter)\n2 Tbsp minced shallots\n2 Tbsp minced garlic\n1 1/2 teaspoons of Herbs de Provence or a teaspoon of dried tarragon\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Salt and pepper roast, let sit at room temp: Remove roast from refrigerator 1 to 2 hours before cooking so that it has time to come close to room temperature. Sprinkle all sides with salt and pepper and set aside.\n2 Sear roast on stovetop: When ready to cook the tenderloin roast, preheat oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. Heat olive oil in a cast iron or thick-bottomed saut\xc3\xa9 pan that can take the heat, on high heat. When the oil is hot, place the roast in the pan and brown it on all sides, including the ends, about 10 minutes.\n3 Finish cooking in oven: When sufficiently browned, remove the roast from the pan (do not clean out the pan) and place on a roasting pan.\nPlace in the oven and roast at 425F until the internal temperature is 130\xc2\xb0F for rare (140\xc2\xb0F for medium), about 20 minutes (or longer if your roast wasn't at room temp to begin with. Use a meat thermometer!\n4 Let roast rest before slicing: Remove from oven and loosely tent with foil to rest for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing.\n5 Saut\xc3\xa9 shallots, garlic, mushrooms: While the roast is resting, prepare the mushrooms. Add 3 Tbsp of butter to the same pan you used to sear the beef roast. Heat on medium heat to melt the butter. Add the minced shallots and garlic, and cook for half a minute.\nStir the mushrooms into the pan and cook until they start to give off steam. Then add salt, pepper, and herbs de provence. Continue to cook until just cooked through.\nAdd a few tablespoons of warm water to the pan to scrape up any remnants from the bottom of the pan (can also use white wine or marsala). Remove from heat.\n6 Slice the roast: Use a sharp knife to slice the roast across the grain into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices. Serve with the saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms.\nHello!

Add the onion and cook a few minutes, until translucent.\n2 Add potatoes and corned beef: Mix in the chopped corned beef and potatoes. Spread out evenly over the pan. Increase the heat to high or medium high and press down on the mixture with a metal spatula.\n3 Cook until browned, then flip: Do not stir the potatoes and corned beef, but let them brown. If you hear them sizzling, this is good.\nUse a metal spatula to peek underneath and see if they are browning. If nicely browned, use the spatula to flip sections over in the pan so that they brown on the other side. Press down again with the spatula.\nIf there is too much sticking, you can add a little more butter to the pan. Continue to cook in this manner until the potatoes and the corned beef are nicely browned.\n4 Stir in parsley, black pepper to serve: Remove from heat, stir in chopped parsley. Add plenty of freshly ground black pepper, and add salt to taste.\nServe with fried or poached eggs for breakfast.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

(You can also place the steak and marinade in a freezer bag and place it in a bowl.)\nChill and marinate for at least 2 hours and up to overnight.\n2 Prepare your grill for high, direct heat with one part of the grill for lower, indirect heat. The grill is hot enough when you hold your hand about an inch over the hot side and you can only hold it there for about a second.\n3 Grill the steak: Remove the steak from the marinade and gently shake off the excess marinade from the steak (but make sure there is still a coating of it, you'll want the oil on it to help keep the steak from sticking to the grill).\nIf you want, sprinkle generously on all sides with coarse salt and freshly ground pepper. The salt and pepper will help form a savory crust on the steak.\nPlace steak on the hot side of the grill. Grill for a minute or two on each side to get a good sear, then move the steak to the cooler side of the grill, cover and cook a few minutes more until done to your liking.\nHow do you know when the steak is done? One way to tell is to poke it with your fingertips. While the steak is still raw, test it with your fingers; it will be quite squishy. That's what a very rare steak feels like. Touch the tip of your nose and that's what a very well done steak feels like. Here's a visual guide, the finger test to check the doneness of steak.\nOtherwise use a good meat thermometer (I recommend a thermapen.)  Pull the steak off the grill at 120 to 125\xc2\xb0F for rare, 130-140\xc2\xb0F for medium rare, and 145\xc2\xb0F for medium.\n4 Rest the steak: When the steak has cooked to your preferred level of doneness, remove from the grill and place on a cutting board. Cover with aluminum foil to hold in the heat while the steak rests for 10 to 15 minutes.\n5 Slice across the grain: Notice the direction of the muscle fibers of the steak; this is called the grain of the meat. Flank steak is a very lean cut that will be tough and chewy unless you cut it in a way that breaks up the muscle fibers.\nSo, cut the steak across the grain of the meat, at a steep diagonal, so that the slices are wide. I find it easiest to use a long serrated bread knife for this, but any long sharp knife will do.\nIf you want, you can take the excess marinade and bring it to a boil, simmer for several minutes, and serve with the flank steak. Great also with salsa or horseradish sauce.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"
b'Print\nHome Cured Corned Beef\nPrep time: 5 daysCook time: 3 hours\nThe spice mix with the gallon of brine makes easily enough curing brine for a 5 pound brisket, cured in a somewhat large-ish container. If you were to use a 2-gallon freezer bag or marinating bag, you would likely need just half (or less) of the amount of brine and brine spices.\nPink curing salt, or sodium nitrite, goes by many names, such as Prague Powder #1 or DQ Curing Salt #1, and is available online and may be available at your local specialty market or butcher shop. If you don\'t have it, you can still make corned beef, but it is necessary for that vibrant pink color we associate with corned beef. And it adds flavor too. Without it the corned beef will be a dull grey color.\nNote that pink curing salt is NOT Himalayan pink salt. Pink curing salt is toxic and can be deadly if ingested directly, which is why it is colored pink, so consumers do not mistake it for table salt.\nINGREDIENTS\nPickling spices:\n1 tablespoon whole allspice berries\n1 tablespoon whole mustard seeds (brown or yellow)\n1 tablespoon coriander seeds\n1 tablespoon red pepper flakes\n1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns\n2 teaspoons whole cloves\n9 whole cardamom pods\n6 large bay leaves, crumbled\n2 teaspoons ground ginger\n1/2 stick cinnamon\nBrine:\n1 gallon (3.8 liters) water\n300 g Kosher salt (2 cups of Diamond Crystal brand Kosher Salt OR 1 cup 3 1/2 tablespoons of Morton\'s Kosher Salt)\n5 teaspoons pink curing salt (optional, see Recipe Note)\n3 tablespoons pickling spices\n1/2 cup (90 g) brown sugar\nBrisket:\n1 5-pound beef brisket\n1 tablespoon pickling spices\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toast and crush spices: You can either used store-bought pickling spices or you can make your own. To make your own, toast the allspice berries, mustard seeds, coriander seeds, red pepper flakes, peppercorns, cloves, and cardamom pods in a small frying pan on medium heat until fragrant. Note that it is pretty easy to burn spices; you want enough heat to release their flavors, not so much that they get burned.\nRemove from heat and place in a small bowl. Use a mortar and pestle to crush the spices a little (or the back of a spoon or the side of a knife on a flat surface). Add to a small bowl and stir in the crumbled bay leaves and ground ginger.\n2 Make curing brine: Add about 3 Tbsp of the spice mix (reserve the rest for cooking the corned beef after it has cured), plus the half stick of cinnamon, to a gallon of water in a large pot, along with the Kosher salt, pink salt (if using), and brown sugar. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. Then refrigerate until well chilled.\n3 Brine the brisket for 5-7 days: Place the brisket in a large, flat container or pan, and cover with the brine. The brine should cover the meat. The meat may float in which case you may want to weigh it down with a plate.\nAlternatively you can use a 2-gallon freezer bag (placed in a container so if it leaks it doesn\'t leak all over your refrigerator), place the brisket in the freezer bag and about 2 quarts of brine, squeezing out the air from the bag before sealing.\nPlace in the refrigerator and chill from 5-7 days. Every day flip the brisket over, so that all sides get brined equally.\n4 Cook the corned beef: At the end of the cure, remove the brisket from the brine and rinse off the brine with cold water. Place the brisket in a large pot that just fits around the brisket and cover with at least one inch of water. If you want your brisket less salty, add another inch of water to the pot.\nAdd a tablespoon of the pickling spices to the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce to a very low simmer (barely bubbling), and cook 3-4 hours, until the corned beef is fork tender. (At this point you can store in the fridge for up to a week.)\n5 Cut across the grain: Remove the meat to a cutting board. (You can use the spiced cooking liquid to cook vegetables for boiled dinner or corned beef and cabbage.) Notice the visible lines on the meat; this is the "grain" of the meat, or the direction of the muscle fibers.\nTo make the meat easier to cut, cut it first in half, along the grain of the meat. Then make thin crosswise cuts, across the grain to cut the meat to serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

All of the flavor a gravy you make from the drippings comes from those browned bits. You need fat as a base for the gravy.\nIf you have pan juices, but they haven\'t browned at the bottom of the pan after the roast is done, you can put the empty pan back in the oven. Set the temp to 450 or 500\xc2\xb0F and cook until the juices evaporate and begin to bubble and brown at the bottom of the pan.\nIn this approach to making gravy, we break up the drippings as well as we can with a whisk, but don\'t worry about any browned bits in the gravy itself. If you want, you can pulse the gravy in a blender to make it smoother, but we never bother. The browned bits are the best part!\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nMaking Gravy with Flour\n1 Remove all but 1/4 cup of fat from pan: Remove the roast from the pan. Remove excess fat leaving 4 Tbsp of fat plus juices and browned drippings in the pan.\n2 Scrape up drippings and place pan on stovetop on medium heat: Use a metal spatula to scrape up any drippings that are sticking to the pan. Place the pan on the stovetop on medium high heat.\n3 Sprinkle 4 Tbsp flour onto the drippings. Quickly stir with a wire whisk so that the flour gets incorporated into the drippings. Let the flour brown a bit if you want, before adding liquid in the next step. (You can also start with a slurry of flour and water if you want.)\n4 Whisk while slowly adding liquid: Slowly add stock, water, milk, cream, or a combination to the pan, whisking vigorously to dissolve the flour into liquid.\nAllow the gravy to simmer and thicken, and continue to slowly add liquid until you have about 2 cups of gravy. (You\'ll probably need to add 3 to 4 cups of liquid.)\n5 Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Always taste first before adding more salt! It may not need it.)\n  Making Gravy with Cornstarch\n1 Remove all but 1/4 cup of fat from pan: Remove the roast from the roasting pan. Pour off all but 4 Tbsp of the fat in the pan. If you don\'t have enough fat in the pan, add butter so that you have at least 4 Tbsp of fat in the pan.\n2 Scrape up browned drippings: While the pan is still warm, scrape the bottom of the pan with a metal spatula to loosen any browned drippings that might be stuck to the bottom of the pan.\n3 Place the pan on the stovetop on medium heat. If you are using a roasting pan that won\'t work well on the stovetop, scrape up all of the drippings and fat and put into a large shallow saut\xc3\xa9 pan.\n4 Make cornstarch slurry: Dissolve 4 Tbsp of cornstarch in the minimum amount of water needed to make a thin paste - about 1/2 cup.\n5 Pour the cornstarch slurry into the pan with drippings and use a wire whisk to blend into the drippings.\n6 Whisk while slowly adding liquid: Stir with a wire whisk until the gravy begins to thicken. As the gravy thickens, slowly add stock, water, milk, or cream, or some combination to the pan (I like to use stock, my mother usually uses water).\nAlternate stirring and adding liquid, maintaining the consistency you want, for several minutes (about 5 minutes).\nYou will probably add about 3 to 4 cups of liquid all together. Taking into consideration the evaporation that is occurring while the gravy is simmering, you will end up with about 2 cups of gravy.\nIf the gravy isn\'t thick enough, make more cornstarch slurry and whisk it into the pan.\n7 Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nHello!

The cuts should be at an angle, in the direction of the grain of the meat as the knife tip is going in. The cuts should be about an inch apart from each other.\nTurn the steak over and repeat the cuts on the other side. Make sure that the cuts you are making on this side are parallel with the cuts you made on the other side, otherwise you may cut across an existing cut, and end up poking a hole through the meat.\n2 Rub with salt, pepper, dry mustard, and butter: Sprinkle one side of the steak with salt and freshly ground pepper. Sprinkle the steak with dry mustard. (You can use regular mustard if you don't have any dry mustard.)\nRub a tablespoon of butter all over the side of the steak. Turn the steak over and repeat with the dry mustard, pepper, and butter.\n3 Sear steak in hot frying pan: Heat a large cast iron frying pan on high heat. Place steak in hot pan. Let sear for 2 to 3 minutes until well browned.\nUse tongs to lift up to see if nicely browned. If so, flip to the other side and let sear for 2 to 3 minutes.\n4 Remove from heat: Remove the pan from the heat and let the steak continue to cook for 5 to 10 minutes in the residual heat of the pan (assuming you are using cast iron, if not, lower the heat to low).\n5 Check for doneness: Use your fingertips to check for doneness or insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak - 120\xc2\xb0F for very rare, 125\xc2\xb0F for rare, or 130\xc2\xb0F for medium rare. Flank steak should be served rare or medium rare, otherwise it may be too dry.\nIf the steak isn't done enough to your liking, return the steak and pan to medium high heat for a few minutes.\n6 Let the steak rest: Remove the steak from the pan to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes, covered with aluminum foil.\n7 Thinly slice: Cut the meat in very thin slices, at an angle, across the grain of the meat. (This way you break through the tough long muscle fibers.)\n8 Boil juices, deglaze pan, add butter to make sauce: Any juices that come out of the meat while cutting or resting, return to the pan. Return the pan to a burner on high heat and deglaze the pan with a little water, scraping up any browned bits. Once the water has mostly boiled down, add a little butter to the pan for a nice sauce.\nArrange the cut meat on a serving plate and pour the deglazed pan juices over the meat.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nNew England Boiled Dinner Recipe\nCook time: 4 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nCorned beef can be pretty salty, so if you are making boiled dinner with corned beef you may want to put it in a pot, cover with cold water, bring to a boil, and then discard the water before starting the recipe. If the broth ends up being too salty, you can serve just the meat and vegetables, without the broth, or add water to the broth to dilute it.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 1/2 pounds corned beef brisket or plain beef brisket\n15 peppercorns\n8 whole cloves\n1 bay leaf\nSalt, if using plain brisket\n2 medium sized turnips, peeled and quartered\n4 red new potatoes, peeled and quartered\n3 large carrots, cut into thirds and the thickest pieces quartered lengthwise\n1 small head cabbage, cut into fourths\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Put corned beef in a pot, cover with water, add seasonings, simmer: Put the brisket in a 5 or 6 quart Dutch oven and cover with an inch of water.\nIf you are using corned beef brisket and it does not come already packed in seasoning, add peppercorns, cloves, and a bay leaf to the pot.\nIf using plain brisket, add a teaspoon of salt for every quart of water.\nBring to a simmer and then cover, lower the heat until it is barely simmering. Keep at a low simmer for four hours or until the meat is tender (a fork goes through easily).\n2 Remove meat, add vegetables, simmer: Remove the meat and set aside, keeping the meat warm. Add the vegetables to the pot. Check the broth for taste. If it is too salty, add a little more water to taste.\nRaise the temperature and bring the soup to a high simmer. Cook at a high simmer until done, about 15-30 minutes longer, depending on the size of the cut of your vegetables.\n\n3 Slice meat across the grain: Slice the meat in thin slices across the grain. You may find it easier to slice if you first cut the roast in half along the same direction as the grain of the meat. Then slice smaller lengths across the grain.\n\nServe in bowls, a few pieces of meat in each, add some of the vegetables and some broth. Serve with horseradish or mustard or both.\nHello!

After you add the liquid, bring it to a simmer on the stovetop then put it, tightly covered, in a 225\xc2\xb0F oven for 6 hours (or a 300\xc2\xb0F oven for 4 hours).\nNote that different people have different sensitivities to bitter flavors. If Guinness Stout tastes bitter to you, then the stew will taste bitter as well. If it doesn\'t taste bitter to you, the stew should not taste bitter.\nYou can either use celery root, young turnips, or potatoes in addition to parsnips and carrots. If you use turnips, make sure you only use young turnips, which are smaller and sweeter than regular turnips. Regular turnips can be quite bitter.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 Tbsp butter\n2 pounds (900 g) well marbled chuck beef roast, cut into 2-inch pieces\nSalt\n2 cups chopped onion (about 1 large onion)\n2 celery stalks, chopped\n2 Tbsp tomato paste\n1 pint (16 ounces, 475 ml) Guinness extra stout (make sure you use extra stout and not draught)\n3 cups (700 ml) beef broth\n2 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks\n3 to 4 parsnips, peeled and cut into chunks\n1/2 pound (280 g) celery root, potatoes, or very young turnips, peeled and cut into chunks\n2 teaspoons dried thyme\n4 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart or larger slow cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the beef, transfer to slow cooker: Heat the butter in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium-high heat. Brown the beef in the butter, starting with the fattiest pieces of meat, fat side down in the pan. This will allow some beef fat to render out. Work in batches as to not crowd the pan.\nSprinkle salt over the beef as it browns. Once browned on all sides, transfer the beef pieces into a 6-quart or larger slow cooker.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions and celery, transfer to slow cooker: Add the onions and celery to the pan in which you just browned the beef. Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions and celery until they begin to brown at the edges, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the tomato paste and mix well. Cook for a minute or two, then add a little of the Guinness, enough to make it easier for you to scrape up any browned bits at the bottom of the pan.\nTransfer the celery and onions into the slow cooker.\n3 Add Guinness, broth, root vegetables, thyme, salt: Add the rest of the Guinness, the beef broth, carrots, parsnips, celery root, and thyme to the slow cooker. Add two teaspoons of salt.\n4 Cook in slow cooker: Cover and cook on "high" for 4 hours, or "low" for 8 hours. When done, add more salt to taste.

(The pot will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure before the actual cooking time begins.)\nWhen the cooking program finishes, let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then release the remaining pressure by moving the pressure vent to its \xe2\x80\x9cventing\xe2\x80\x9d position.\nAt this point, you may also leave the stew on the \xe2\x80\x9cKeep Warm\xe2\x80\x9d setting for up to 10 hours, before continuing with the rest of the recipe. The beef will become more tender the longer it sits.\n5 Add the root vegetables and pressure cook: When the pressure has released, open the pot. (Optional: for a leaner stew, you can use a ladle or spoon to skim off some of the fat.) Stir in the carrots, parsnips, and root vegetables.\nPut the lid back on the pressure cooker and make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s set to its \xe2\x80\x9csealing\xe2\x80\x9d position. Cancel the cooking program, then select the \xe2\x80\x9cPressure Cook\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cManual\xe2\x80\x9d setting and set the cooking time to 3 minutes at high pressure.  (The pot will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure before the actual cooking time begins.)\n6 While the stew is finishing, mix the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl to make a slurry.\n7 Finish the stew: When the cooking program ends, perform a quick pressure release by moving the pressure vent to its \xe2\x80\x9cventing\xe2\x80\x9d position. (It\'s also ok if you need to leave the stew on the "Warm" setting for a little while before venting the pressure and serving, though the vegetables will eventually start to get mushy if left too long.)\nStir in the cornstarch slurry right away while stew is still bubbling. The residual heat will thicken the stew within a couple minutes.\n8 Serve: Ladle the stew into bowls and serve it hot, with fresh parsley sprinkled on top.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nBeef Noodle Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 8\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 medium white onion, peeled and chopped, about 1 1/2 cups\n1 bell pepper, seeded, ribs removed, finely chopped, about 1 cup\n3 cloves garlic, minced, about 1 tablespoon\n1 28-ounce can whole peeled or crushed tomatoes\n1 1/2 pounds ground beef\nSalt\n4 ounces mushrooms, sliced\n12 ounces egg noodles\n1 1/2 cups frozen corn, defrosted\n1 15-ounce can of black olives, strained and chopped\n8 ounces cheddar cheese, grated\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven and start heating water: Pre-heat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F and start to heat a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt, 2 quarts water) for cooking the egg noodles.\n2 Make tomato sauce base: Heat 1 Tbsp of oil on medium high heat in a large, heavy bottomed pot or skillet. Add the onions and bell pepper and saut\xc3\xa9 until softened, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook for a minute more.\nAdd the tomatoes, breaking them up with your fingers or a knife if you are using whole canned tomatoes. Bring to a simmer and let cook for 10 minutes. Lower the heat to warm.\n3 Brown the ground beef: In a separate skillet, add 1 Tbsp of oil and heat to medium-high. Working in batches, so you do not crowd the pan, add the ground beef, breaking it up with your fingers as you add it to the pan.\nDo not stir the ground beef, but let it sit and cook for a minute or two until it browns on one side.\nSprinkle a little salt over the meat while cooking.\nOnce browned on one side, turn the pieces over to get the other side browned.

b"Save It Print\nSwedish Meatballs Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4 to 6 as a main, 8 to 12 as an appetizer\nLingonberry jelly is traditionally used with Swedish meatballs; you can substitute cranberry, red currant or raspberry jelly if you can't find lingonberry jelly.\nThis recipe serves 4 to 6 people and can easily be doubled for serving a party.\nINGREDIENTS\nMeatballs:\n1 Tbsp butter\n1/2 large yellow or white onion, peeled, grated (use the large holes of a box cheese grater)\n1/4 cup milk\n3 slices of bread, crusts removed, bread cut into cubes (2 cups of cubed bread)\n1 large egg\n3/4 pound ground beef\n1/2 pound ground pork\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg\n1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom\nSauce:\n3 Tbsp butter\n3 Tbsp flour\n2 cups beef stock\n1/4 cup sour cream (use full-fat sour cream or the sauce may curdle)\nSalt and pepper\n2 Tbsp of Lingonberry, red currant, raspberry or cranberry jelly, less or more to taste (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Soak bread in milk, shred: Place the cubed bread in a large bowl and mix with the milk. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes for the bread to absorb all of the milk. Once the bread has soaked up the milk, shred with the tines of a fork or by hand.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 grated onion: Melt the butter in a saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium-high heat. Stir in the grated onion and cook until translucent and softened, 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for a minute.\n3 Make meatball mixture with bread, onions, eggs, meat, spices: Stir the cooled onions into the milk bread mixture. Add the eggs, ground pork and beef, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cardamom. Use your (clean) hands to mix everything together until well combined.\n(If you have extra time, chilling the mixture for 20 minutes or so will make it easier to roll out the meatballs.)\n4 Form meatballs: Use your hands to form the mixture into meatballs about 1 1/4-inch to 1 1/2-inch wide and place them on a plate or sheet pan. This recipe should make about 40 meatballs. Note that the meatballs will be a bit on the wet side.\n5 Brown meatballs on all sides: Heat 3 Tbsp of butter in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. When the butter is melted and foamy, start adding some meatballs to the pan.\nWorking in batches as to not crowd the pan, slowly brown the meatballs on all sides. Use a spoon or tongs to turn them. Handle the meatballs gently so they do not break apart as you turn them.\n   Once the meatballs have browned on all sides and are just cooked through, remove them from the pan to a bowl. You'll warm the meatballs in the sauce later.\nOnce you have removed the meatballs from the pan, wipe out the butter and browned and blackened bits with a paper towel and rinse out the pan.\nWe'll want to start with fresh butter because that way we won't pick up any burnt bits from the pan, and we will be able to more accurately gauge the amount of fat in the pan for making the meatball sauce in the next step.\n6 Make a roux: To make the sauce, first make the roux. Add 3 Tbsp of fresh butter to the pan. Heat the butter in the pan on medium heat until it melts and starts to bubble up.\nSlowly whisk in 3 Tbsp of flour. Stir until smooth. Continue to stir, allowing the flour mixture to cook, several minutes, until the roux is the color of coffee-with-cream.\n   7 Add stock to roux to make sauce: When the roux has cooked to a lovely shade of light brown, slowly add the stock to the roux, stirring as you add the stock.\nThe stock will sputter at first and the roux may seize up, but keep adding the stock slowly and keep stirring. Eventually the sauce will loosen and become silky.\n8 Stir in sour cream and jelly if using: Remove the pan from heat and stir in the sour cream. If you are including jelly, either stir it in now or serve it on the side. Taste for seasonings and add more salt and pepper to taste (I use about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.)\n9 Add meatballs to sauce: Return the meatballs to the pan with the sauce and cook on low heat to warm the meatballs through for a few minutes.\n10 Serve: Serve over mashed potatoes or egg noodles. Or serve individual Swedish meatballs dipped in gravy as an appetizer.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nBeef and Broccoli Ramen Stir Fry Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: 4 servings\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the stir fry sauce:\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger\n1/3 cup soy sauce\n1/4 cup honey\n1/4 cup hoisin sauce\n3/4 cup beef broth\n2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n2 tablespoons sesame oil\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\nFor the stir fry:\n2 (3-ounce) packages dried ramen noodles, seasoning packets discarded\n2 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n1 pound sirloin steak, trimmed of fat and sliced into 1/4-inch thick strips\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n3 cups fresh broccoli florets\nSesame seeds, garnish\nSriracha, garnish (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\n12-inch anodized wok\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the stir fry sauce: Add garlic and ginger to a bowl and whisk in soy sauce through sesame oil. Whisk in cornstarch last, and try to whisk out as many lumps as possible. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if there are a few lumps, as they will cook out when you add the sauce to the skillet.\nThis makes a lot, because I like this dish to be very saucy. You could halve the recipe if you like a drier stir fry. If you have leftover sauce, it stores well in the fridge for a week in an airtight container or jar.\n2 Prepare the noodles: Cook dry ramen noodles in boiling water until they are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the noodles and rinse with cold water to stop them from cooking.\n3 Cook the stir fry: In a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season the steak with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper.\nOnce the skillet is glistening hot, add the steak strips. Cook for about 3 minutes, undisturbed, to allow them to sear well on one side. Then stir and continue to cook for 2 to 3 more minutes, until the steak is cooked through.\nRemove the steak from skillet, and add another tablespoon of olive oil and the broccoli florets. Add 1/2 cup of water to the skillet and cover. Steam broccoli for 2 minutes. Broccoli should be bright green and tender, and not mushy at all.\nAdd the steak back to the skillet, along with cooked and rinsed noodles. Pour in all of the sauce. (If you prefer a drier stir fry, you can start with half the sauce.) Use tongs or a large rubber spatula to stir together ingredients as sauce cooks. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes until sauce thickens.\n5 Serve: Serve stir fry immediately, garnished with sesame seeds and, optionally, sriracha.\nHello!

b"Print\nPressure Cooker Shepherd's Pie Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nChanges I Made to This Cookbook Recipe:\nI used beef instead of lamb\nI used chicken stock instead of vegetable stock (it's what I had!)\nTaste the mashed potatoes and the filling for seasoning and add salt if needed (I used roughly double the amount of salt as indicated in the recipe)\nReprinted with permission from The Ultimate Instant Pot Cookbook, copyright 2018 by Coco Morante. Published by Ten Speed Press, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon avocado oil or other neutral oil with high smoke point\n1 pound ground lamb or beef\n1 yellow onion, diced\n1 celery stalk, diced\n1 large carrot, diced\n1 garlic clove, minced\n1 1/4 teaspoons kosher salt\n1 teaspoon dried thyme\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n1 tablespoon tomato paste\n1 cup vegetable broth\n1 cup frozen peas\n4 medium russet potatoes, peeled (about 2 1/2 pounds)\n1/2 cup whole milk\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart electric pressure cooker, such as the Instant Pot\nSteam rack for pressure cookers\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the meat: Select the Saut\xc3\xa9 setting on the Instant Pot and heat the avocado oil. Add the lamb and saut\xc3\xa9, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or spatula, for about 7 minutes, until cooked through and no traces of pink remain.\nSet a colander in a bowl. Wearing heat-resistant mitts, lift out the inner pot and pour the lamb into the colander, letting it drain. Return the inner pot to the Instant Pot housing. (Note from Emma: I just scooped out the meat with a slotted spoon and then poured off all but a tablespoon of fat, which I used for sauteing the vegetables.)\n2 Cook the vegetables and stir in the meat: Add the onion, celery, carrot, garlic, and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt to the pot and saut\xc3\xa9 for about 4 minutes, until the onion is translucent. (Note from Emma: As the onions release moisture, use that to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. More flavor!)\nStir in the thyme, pepper, Worcestershire, and tomato paste. Return the lamb to the pot, then add the vegetable broth and peas.\n3  Add the potatoes: Place a tall steam rack in the pot, making sure all of its legs are resting firmly on the bot\xc2\xadtom. Place the potatoes in a single layer on the rack.\n4 Pressure cook the filling and the potatoes together: Secure the lid and set the Pressure Release to Sealing. Press the Cancel button to reset the cooking program, then select the Pressure Cook or Manual program and set the cooking time for 15 minutes at high pressure. (The pot will take about 15 minutes to come up to pres\xc2\xadsure before the cooking program begins.)\n5 Vent the pressure: When the cooking program ends, perform a quick pressure release by moving the Pressure Release to Venting.\n6 Mash the potatoes: Using tongs, transfer the potatoes to a bowl. Add the milk and remaining 3/4 teaspoon salt, then use a potato masher to mash the potatoes until smooth. (Note from Emma: If the filling seems a little liquidy at this point, put the Instant Pot on the Saut\xc3\xa9 function and let it simmer while you mash the potatoes.)\nWearing heat-resistant mitts, remove the steam rack from the pot. Stir 1/2 cup of the mashed potatoes into the lamb mixture in the pot. (Note from Emma: Taste both the mashed potatoes and the filling at this point, and add more salt if needed.)\n7 Assemble the casserole: Transfer the lamb mixture to a broiler-safe 8-inch square baking dish, dollop the mashed potatoes on top, and spread them out with a fork, creating a surface texture.\nNote: If you like, instead of assembling and broiling the pie, you can simply serve the lamb mixture with the mashed potatoes on the side.\n8 Broil the casserole: Broil the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s pie in a toaster oven (or a conventional oven) for about 5 minutes, checking often, until the potatoes are lightly browned.\n9 Serve: Spoon the shepherd\xe2\x80\x99s pie onto plates and serve immediately.\nNote from Emma: Leftovers will keep for about a week in the fridge and can be warmed in a low oven or in the microwave.\nHello!

Add the minced carrots and saut\xc3\xa9 for 5 minutes. (If you are using bell pepper instead of carrots, add those at the same time as the onions.)\nAdd the chopped onion and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally until onions are translucent, about 5 more minutes.\nAdd the minced garlic and cook for 30 more seconds. Remove from heat. Remove vegetables from the pan to a medium sized bowl, set aside.\n2 Brown the ground beef: Using the same pan (or you can cook the meat at the same time as the vegetables in a separate pan to save time), crumble the ground beef into the pan. If you are using extra lean beef, you may need to add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Sprinkle the meat with salt.\nDo not stir the ground beef, just let it cook until it is well browned on one side. Then flip the pieces over and brown the second side.\nIf you're cooking in batches, use a slotted spoon to remove the ground beef from the pan (can add to the set-aside vegetables) and repeat with the rest of the ground beef.\nWhen the meat is done cooking, strain off all but 1 tablespoon of any fat left in the pan.\n3 Make the sloppy joe mix: Return the cooked ground beef and vegetables to the pan. Use a wooden spoon to break up any chunks of ground beef into smaller bits.\nAdd the ketchup, tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and brown sugar to the pan. Stir to mix well. Add ground cloves, thyme, and cayenne pepper.\nLower the heat to medium low and let simmer for 10 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste.\n4 Serve the sloppy joes: Serve immediately, or refrigerate to make ahead and reheat to serve. Serve with toasted hamburger buns.\nHello!

Add the short ribs and brown well on all sides, working in batches so as to not crowd the pan.\nWhen the short ribs are browned well, transfer them to a slow cooker.\n2 Scrape up the pan drippings: Add the shallot, carrots, and celery to the skillet along with 1/2 cup of water. Use the liquid to scrape up any bits stuck to the pan.\nTransfer the vegetables (they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to be fully cooked) to the slow cooker along with any liquid from the skillet.\n3 Slow cook the short ribs and veggies: Add beef broth, bourbon, brown sugar, Worcestershire, garlic, and bay leaf to the slow cooker. Cover and cook on low for 8 hours (or high for 5 to 6 hours).\n4 Cook the grits: When there\xe2\x80\x99s about thirty minutes left on the short ribs, heat the stock in a medium pot over medium heat until it\xe2\x80\x99s simmering.\nWhisk in corn grits in a steady stream. Turn the heat down to low, and cover the pot and simmer for about 20 minutes until grits are thick and tender. Stir regularly to prevent sticking.\nThe only way to truly know when grits are done is to taste them. If they are crunchy, keep going and if you need to add more liquid, then do so.\nWhen the grits are soft, add salt, pepper, butter, and cheese and stir to combine. Keep warm until ready to serve. If the grits get too thick (they hold their shape if stirred and don\xe2\x80\x99t flow back into a single layer), add water by the 1/4 cup to loosen the grits.\n5 Serve: Divide the grits onto between plates and top each plate with a short rib. Add the veggies and a few spoonfuls of juice from the slow cooker as well and garnish with fresh orange zest.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nEasy Beef Brisket Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 3 hoursYield: Serves 8\nINGREDIENTS\n3 to 4 pounds of a brisket cut of beef\n3/4 cup barbecue sauce\n1/4 cup soy sauce\n1 cup of water\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 300\xc2\xbaF.\n2 Make the sauce: In a bowl, mix together the barbecue sauce, soy sauce, and water.\n3 Roast the brisket in the oven (2 methods):\nFoil method: Place a large piece of aluminum foil in a roasting pan. Add the brisket and spread the BBQ sauce mixture generously over meat. Wrap the brisket in the aluminum foil so it's well sealed, like a package.\nBake for 3 hours for a 3 pound roast and 1 more hour for every additional pound of meat.\nOR, instead of foil, you can use an oven roasting bag:\nOven roasting bag method: Place the barbecue sauce and the brisket in an oven roasting bag. Sprinkle a teaspoon of flour into the bag. Poke a couple small holes in the bag. Place the bag in a roasting pan. You may find that the cooking time is faster with this method, or you can reduce the oven temperature to 275\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Let the brisket rest: Remove from oven and let rest in the foil for 30 minutes before serving.\n5 Slice across the grain of the meat: The easiest way to serve the roast is to first cut it in half along the grain of the meat (poke the meat with the tip of a knife or tines of a fork to see which way the grain or lines of the muscles are going if you can't see it from the surface).\nThen make 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick cuts across the grain to serve. (Cutting the meat across the grain will make it much easier to eat, as the cuts break up the muscle tissue.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nBeef Brisket Pot Roast Recipe\nPrep time: 35 minutesCook time: 4 hours, 15 minutesYield: Serves 8-12\nINGREDIENTS\n4 to 5 pound (about 2 kg) beef brisket, flat cut or point cut\nSalt\n1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n3 large onions, sliced\n5 to 6 garlic cloves, minced\n1 sprig thyme\n1 sprig rosemary\n3 to 4 bay leaves\n2 cups beef stock\n2 to 3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces\n1 tablespoon mustard (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the brisket: On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.\nUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.\nSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n2 Sear the brisket: You\'ll need an ovenproof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\nPat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\nTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot. If not, add some olive oil.\nAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Saut\xc3\xa9, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1 to 2 more minutes.\n4 Simmer the brisket and roast it: Preheat the oven to 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C). Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.\nMove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop. Cover the pot, then place in the 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C) oven. Cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.\n5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\n6 Remove brisket: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.\n7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.\nTo make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into a blender, and pur\xc3\xa9e until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.\n8 Slice and serve: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the "grain" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices. (A sturdy bread knife works great for slicing roasts.)\nServe with the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles, or polenta.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHow to Make Beef Stock\nYield: Makes about 4 quarts\nINGREDIENTS\n4-5 pounds meaty beef stock bones (with lots of marrow), including some knuckle bones if possible, cut to expose the center marrow, and include at least a couple veal bones if you can, for their gelatin\n1 pound of stew meat (chuck or flank steak) and/or beef scraps, cut into 2-inch chunks\nOlive oil\n1-2 medium onions, peeled and quartered\n1-2 large carrots, cut into 1-2 inch segments\nHandful of celery tops, or 1 large celery rib, cut into 1 inch segments\n2-3 cloves of garlic, unpeeled\nHandful of parsley, stems and leaves\n1-2 bay leaves\n10 peppercorns\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Roast the meat, bones, and vegetables:  Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. Rub a little olive oil over the stew meat pieces, carrots, and onions. Place stock bones, stew meat or beef scraps, carrots and onions in a large, shallow roasting pan.\nRoast in oven for about 45 minutes, turning the bones and meat pieces half-way through the cooking, until nicely browned. If bones begin to char at all during this cooking process, lower the heat. They should brown, not burn.\nWhen the bones and meat are nicely browned, remove them and the vegetables and place them in a large (12 to 16 quart) stock pot.\n2 Add hot water and scrape up the browned bits: Place the roasting pan on the stove-top on low heat (will cover 2 burners), pour 1/2 cup to a cup of hot water over the pan and use a metal spatula to scrape up all of the browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan.\nPour the browned bits and water into the stock pot.\n3 Add vegetables, water, bring to a low simmer: Add celery tops, garlic, parsley, bay leaves, and peppercorns to the stock pot.\nFill the stock pot with cold water, to 1 to 2 inches over the top of the bones. Put the heat on high and bring the pot to a low simmer and then reduce the heat to low.\nIf you have a candy or meat thermometer, the temperature of the water should be between 180\xc2\xb0 and 200\xc2\xb0F (boiling is 212\xc2\xb0F). The stock should be at a bare simmer, just a bubble or two coming up here and there. (You may need to put the pot on your smallest burner on the lowest temp, or if you are using an oven-safe pot, place it in the oven at 190\xc2\xb0F.)\nCover the pot loosely and let simmer low and slow for 3-6 hours.\nDo not stir the stock while cooking. Stirring will mix the fats in with the stock, clouding up the stock.\n4 Skim scum and fat: As the stock cooks, fat will be released from the bone marrow and stew meat and rise to the top. From time to time check in on the stock and use a large metal spoon to scoop away the fat and any scum that rises to the surface.\n(Do not put this fat down your kitchen drain. It will solidify and block your pipes. Put it in a bowl or jar to save for cooking or to discard.)\n5 Remove solids and strain: At the end of cooking time (when you want to end the cooking is up to you, 3 hours minimum, 6 to 8 hours if you can do it) use a slotted spoon or spider ladle to gently remove the bones and vegetables from the pot (discard them, though if you see a chunk of marrow, taste it, it's delicious).\nLine another large pot (8-quart) with a fine mesh sieve, covered with a couple layers of cheesecloth if you have it.\nPour the stock through the sieve to strain it of remaining solids.\n6 Chill: Let cool to room temperature then chill in the refrigerator.\nOne the stock has chilled, any fat remaining will have risen to the top and solidified. The fat forms a protective layer against bacteria while the stock is in the refrigerator. If you plan to freeze the stock however, remove and discard the fat, pour the stock into a jar or plastic container. (You can also remove the fat, and boil the stock down, concentrating it so that it doesn't take as much storage space.) Leave an inch head room from the top of the stock to the top of the jar, so that as the stock freezes and expands, it will not break the container.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nChicken Fried Steak Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n4 quarter-pound cube steaks (pre-tenderized) or round steaks\nA sprinkling of salt for pre-salting the meat\n2 cups flour, for breading\n2 teaspoons Kosher salt, for breading\n1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon cayenne\n2 large eggs, beaten\n1/2 cup milk\nCanola oil, peanut oil, extra virgin olive oil, or other fat for frying\nGravy:\n3 tablespoons pan drippings\n3 tablespoons flour\n1/4 cup whipping cream\n1 3/4 cups milk\nSalt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n  METHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Pound steaks to an even thinness: If you are using round steak instead of the pre-tenderized cube steak, you will need to pound the steaks thin or they will be way too chewy. (Already tenderized cube steaks can also use some meat mallet attention to get more thin.)\nPlace each steak between two pieces of plastic wrap. Using a meat mallet, rubber mallet, rolling pin, or empty wine bottle, beat the steak until it is very thin, less than 1/4-inch.\nAs you beat the steak, you will want to turn over often, and spread out the plastic wrap which tends to wrinkle as you work.\n2 Salt meat, warm the oven: Sprinkle a little salt over the meat. Preheat the oven to 200\xc2\xb0F.  In the oven put a wire rack over a baking sheet. This will keep the finished steaks warm and dry while you cook the gravy.\n3 Dredge steaks in flour, egg, and flour again: Prepare two wide, shallow dishes such as a pyrex casserole dish. In the first  whisk together the eggs and milk. In the second, whisk together the flour, salt, cayenne, and garlic powder.\nWorking one at a time, dredge a steak into the flour. Using the heel of your hand, press the flour into both sides of the steak.\nLift up the steak, shake off the excess flour and dip the steak into the egg wash, coating it on both sides.\nLift the steak out of the egg wash, shake off the excess egg wash, and then dredge the steak again in the flour. Again, press the flour into the steak on both sides.\nSet aside on a plate. Repeat with remaining steaks.\n4 Fry the steaks: Pour enough oil in a large frying pan to cover the bottom by 1/4-inch. Heat the oil to 350\xc2\xb0F or when you drop a little flour into the oil it sizzles. If the oil doesn't sizzle it isn't ready, if it burns, the oil is too hot, reduce the heat.\nWorking one at a time, lay a flour-egg-coated steak into the hot oil. Gently shake the pan a little to wash a little hot oil on the top of the steak. Or you can use a metal spoon to spoon some of the oil over the steak. This sets the coating.\nFry until you see the edges of the steak turn golden brown, about two minutes. Carefully turn the steak over in the pan, and fry for two more minutes.\nOnce both sides of the steak are golden brown, tip the steak up with a metal spatula to drain the excess oil. Remove it from the pan and place if on the wire rack in the oven to keep warm. Repeat with the remaining steaks.\n5 Make a roux with fat and flour: Turn off the heat of the pan. Pour out all but about 3 tablespoons of fat from the pan. Whisk in 3 tablespoons of flour and turn the heat on to medium.\nLet the flour mixture cook until it's the color of milk chocolate, about 4 to 5 minutes, stirring constantly.\n6 Stir in milk and cream to make gravy: When the flour fat mixture is smooth and a lovely milk chocolate color, slowly add the milk and cream, whisking constantly. Note that the mixture will seize up initially, and will loosen as you whisk in more liquid.\nAdd milk to your desired thickness for gravy. If the gravy is too thick for you, add more milk. If it's too thin, let it cook longer.\nSeason with salt to taste. Season with lots of black pepper, to taste.\n7 Serve: Serve chicken fried steak with the gravy and a side of mashed potatoes.\nHello!

Once the water is boiling, salt it with 2 Tbsp of salt. Once the water returns to a boil add the pasta to the pot.\nLeave uncovered, let cook on high heat with a vigorous boil. Put the timer on for 8-10 minutes, or whatever your pasta package says is appropriate for al dente (cooked but still a little firm). Drain.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions, garlic, with seasonings: Once you've started to heat the water, start working on the sauce. Heat olive oil in a very large skillet on medium heat. Add the chopped onion, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.\nCook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened. Add the garlic, fresh thyme, season with salt and pepper. Cook for an additional minute, until the garlic is fragrant. Remove from heat and set aside.\n3 Brown the ground beef: Heat a large cast iron pan on high heat. Salt the bottom of the pan generously. Once the pan is hot, break up small chunks of ground beef and add them to the pan, without stirring. (You may need to work in batches; do not crowd the pan.) You want the meat to get well browned.\nIf the pan is too hot and the meat is burning, not browning, take the pan off the heat for a little, and reduce the heat to medium high. On our coil electric stove, it takes the high heat setting for the meat to brown sufficiently, but your stove may be different.\nOnce the meat is browned on one side (a couple of minutes), use a metal spatula to flip the meat over to brown on the other side. At this point, assuming you are using a cast iron pan, you can remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat in the pan will finish cooking the meat.\n4 Add beef and tomato sauce to onions: Use a slotted spoon to lift the meat from the cast iron pan and add it to the pan with the seasoned onions.\nAdd tomato sauce. Use the edge of your metal spatula to break up the bigger chunks of meat into smaller pieces.\nAdd basil. Add a teaspoon of sugar. Bring to a simmer on low heat, let cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes.\n5 Adjust seasonings and add the pasta: Once the sauce has simmered for 15 minutes, adjust seasonings. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add a little more sugar if the sauce is too acidic. Add more tomato sauce if the sauce is a little dry. Stir in the cooked penne pasta. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve immediately.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"
b'Save It Print\nSous Vide Beef Tenderloin with Port Wine and Garlic Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 2 hours, 30 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nOne and half pounds of beef will comfortably feed four people; two pounds will feed six. You can stretch it to feed a few more people if you are serving the tenderloin with several other dishes on the table.\nWhen buying your tenderloin roast, make sure the butcher removes the silver skin. Also ask them to truss the roast with twine. You can do both of these steps yourself, but it\'s one less thing for you to worry about back home!\nINGREDIENTS\n1 1/2 to 2 pounds center-cut beef tenderloin (See Recipe Note)\n1 teaspoon salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided\n2 tablespoons butter\n1/2 cup tawny port wine\n4 to 5 medium cloves garlic\n5 to 6 sprigs fresh thyme, plus extra to serve\nSpecial equipment:\n10-inch stainless steel or cast iron skillet\nJoule, or other sous vide immersion circulator\n1-gallon zip-top freezer bag\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Sear the beef tenderloin: Sprinkle the tenderloin with salt and a generous amount of pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot enough, a drop of water should sizzle and quickly evaporate on contact.\nSear the tenderloin in the pan until it\'s dark brown all over, 1 to 2 minutes on each side and both ends. Transfer to a plate or cutting board and allow to cool slightly.\n2 Make the port-garlic sauce: While the pan is still hot, add the butter and garlic. Cook until the garlic is golden and fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds.\nAdd the port wine and use a stiff spatula to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let the wine come to a simmer, then remove from heat.\n3 Seal the tenderloin in a zip-top freezer bag: Make sure the tenderloin and sauce are no longer steaming. It\'s fine if they are still quite warm, but they can melt through the bag if they\'re still steaming hot.\nPlace a gallon-sized zip-top freezer bag on your counter and flip the zip-top edge outward, forming a cuff around the bag. This helps the bag stay open and upright as you fill it.\nTransfer the tenderloin to the bag and pour the sauce over top. Lay 5 or 6 sprigs of thyme over the top of the tenderloin.\nFill a stock pot with 5 or 6 inches of water. Slowly submerge the tenderloin in the water, using your hands to help push out all the air from the bag as you go. When you reach the top of the bag, zip it closed.\nLift the tenderloin out of the water and place it on a towel while you heat the water for the sous vide.\nRead more about this method here.\n4 Heat the water for sous vide cooking: Place your Joule or other sous vide immersion circulator in the stockpot of water. Set the sous vide immersion circulator to heat the water to 133\xc2\xb0F for rare beef, 140F for medium-rare (my preference), 149\xc2\xb0F for medium-well, or 167\xc2\xb0F for well-done.\n5 Cook the tenderloin sous vide for 2 1/2 to 3 hours: When the water has heated to its required temperature, lower the tenderloin into the water so that it is entirely submerged. It\'s ok if the top of the bag pokes out of the water as long as the tenderloin itself is submerged.\nCook for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, but avoid cooking for much longer or the beef will start to get a little soft and mushy.\n6 Sear the tenderloin a second time: When the tenderloin is done, lift it from the water and place the bag on a kitchen towel. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the skillet over medium-high heat until a drop of water sizzles and evaporates on contact.\nUse tongs to lift the roast from the bag and transfer it to the skillet. Be careful\xe2\x80\x94it will sputter! Sear for 30 to 60 seconds on all sides, until the outside is even more deeply browned and a crust has formed.\nTransfer the tenderloin to a cutting board and rest for 5 to 10 minutes.\n7 Deglaze the pan: With the pan still over medium-high heat, pour in the sauce directly from the bag into the pan (discard the sprigs of thyme). Simmer for about a minute and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Carefully transfer the sauce to a serving cup.\n8 Slice and serve the tenderloin: Cut through the twine and discard. Slice the tenderloin either into thick "filet mignon" steaks (one steak per person), or into thinner "roast beef" slices (3 or 4 slices per person). Serve immediately with the sauce.\nHello!

In a skillet, brown the ground beef in a tablespoon of olive oil on high heat. Stir only infrequently so that the ground beef has an opportunity to brown.\nWhen the beef has mostly browned, add the onions to the pan and toss to combine. Cook until the onions are soft, about 4-6 minutes.\n3 Add seasonings, tomatoes: Add the celery seed, a dash of crushed red pepper and seasoned salt. Pour in canned tomatoes, add the Worcestershire sauce and stir to combine. Simmer for 5 minutes.\n4 Add cooked pasta: Reserve a half cup of the pasta cooking water. Mix in the drained and cooked macaroni and the parsley. Cook for another 5 minutes. Add in some of the pasta water if the dish is too dry.\nAdd freshly ground black pepper and salt to taste.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nItalian Meatballs Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Makes about 16 meatballs. Serves 8\nWe've used equal amounts of ground beef and ground pork. You could also use a third each of ground beef, pork and veal.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the meatballs:\n1 pound ground beef (at least 16 percent fat)\n1 pound ground pork\n2/3 cup milk (whole or 2 percent)\n3 slices of white bread, crusts removed (about 3 ounces)\n1/4 cup ricotta cheese\n1/4 cup grated Parmesan or Romano cheese\n2 large eggs\n1 teaspoon salt (or 2 teaspoons of kosher salt)\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley\n2 teaspoons black pepper\n1 teaspoon dried oregano or marjoram\n2-3 garlic cloves, minced\nAbout 1 cup flour, for dusting\n1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil\n2 1/2 cups (24 ounces) tomato sauce (recipe follows, or use already prepared)\nTomato Sauce:\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n3/4 cup finely chopped onions\n3/4 cup finely chopped carrots\n3/4 cup finely chopped celery\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley\n1 clove garlic, minced\n1 28-oz can crushed or whole tomatoes, including the juice, or 1 3/4 pound of fresh tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and chopped\n1/2 teaspoon dried basil or 2 Tbsp chopped fresh basil\n1 teaspoon tomato paste\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the tomato sauce: Heat olive oil in a large skillet on medium heat. Add the onions, carrots, celery, and parsley. Stir to coat with the oil, reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes until the vegetables are soft and cooked through.\nRemove the cover, add the garlic, and increase the heat to medium high. Cook the garlic for half a minute, then add the tomatoes (if using whole canned tomatoes, break up with your fingers as you add them to the pan). Add the tomato paste and basil. Season with salt and pepper.\nBring to a low simmer, reduce the heat to low and let cook uncovered until thickened while you prepare the meatballs, 15 to 30 minutes.\nPur\xc3\xa9e in a blender, or push through a food mill for a smooth consistency. Return to pan. Adjust seasonings.\n2 Soak torn bread in hot milk: Heat the milk in a small pot until steamy. Turn off the heat, tear the bread into little pieces and soak it in the milk until it partially dissolves. Mash it until you get something that resembles a paste. Turn it out onto a plate to let it cool.\n3 Make meatball mixture: In a large bowl, combine the beef, pork, ricotta cheese, grated Parmesan, eggs, salt, parsley, oregano, black pepper, garlic cloves and the bread-milk mixture. Mix it well with your hands until it barely combines.\nDon't overwork the mixture or it will become tough. It is OK to have some discernible bits of bread or meat in the mix; better that than overworked meatballs.\n4 Form meatballs: Wet your hands and form the meatballs. A traditional size for this sort of meatball is 2-3 inches across, but you can make them any size you want.\nOnce you roll the meatball in your hands, roll it in the flour to give it a good coating. Set each one on a baking sheet as you work. You might need to rinse your hands a few times as you make the meatballs.\n5 Brown meatballs: When all the meatballs are formed, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the meatballs on at least two sides. Don't worry about the center getting cooked through, as you will finish these in the sauce.\n6 Finish cooking meatballs in tomato sauce: Once all the meatballs are browned, arrange them in the sauce, turning each one over in the sauce to coat.\nCover the pot and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes. Serve with the sauce and pasta or crusty bread. Sprinkle with a little chopped parsley for garnish if you want.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nRoast Beef Tenderloin with Saut\xc3\xa9ed Mushrooms Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: Serves 4\nBeef tenderloin is a beautiful, tender cut of beef and is what is used to make filet mignon. To make a roast from the tenderloin you can ask your butcher to cut a big center piece from a whole tenderloin, or purchase a whole tenderloin and cut it yourself for this purpose, saving the rest for filet mignon. You can find whole beef tenderloin at Costco or Sam's Club for a reasonable price.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 3/4 to 2 pound piece of beef tenderloin (preferably a piece cut from the center of the tenderloin), trimmed of excess fat and silverskin\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon coarse black pepper\n1 1/2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n  1 pound cremini mushrooms, sliced into 1/8 to 1/4-inch thick slices\n3 Tbsp butter\n1 teaspoon salt (use 1/2 teaspoon if using salted butter)\n2 Tbsp minced shallots\n2 Tbsp minced garlic\n1 1/2 teaspoons of Herbs de Provence or a teaspoon of dried tarragon\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Salt and pepper roast, let sit at room temp: Remove roast from refrigerator 1 to 2 hours before cooking so that it has time to come close to room temperature. Sprinkle all sides with salt and pepper and set aside.\n2 Sear roast on stovetop: When ready to cook the tenderloin roast, preheat oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. Heat olive oil in a cast iron or thick-bottomed saut\xc3\xa9 pan that can take the heat, on high heat. When the oil is hot, place the roast in the pan and brown it on all sides, including the ends, about 10 minutes.\n3 Finish cooking in oven: When sufficiently browned, remove the roast from the pan (do not clean out the pan) and place on a roasting pan.\nPlace in the oven and roast at 425F until the internal temperature is 130\xc2\xb0F for rare (140\xc2\xb0F for medium), about 20 minutes (or longer if your roast wasn't at room temp to begin with. Use a meat thermometer!\n4 Let roast rest before slicing: Remove from oven and loosely tent with foil to rest for 15 to 20 minutes before slicing.\n5 Saut\xc3\xa9 shallots, garlic, mushrooms: While the roast is resting, prepare the mushrooms. Add 3 Tbsp of butter to the same pan you used to sear the beef roast. Heat on medium heat to melt the butter. Add the minced shallots and garlic, and cook for half a minute.\nStir the mushrooms into the pan and cook until they start to give off steam. Then add salt, pepper, and herbs de provence. Continue to cook until just cooked through.\nAdd a few tablespoons of warm water to the pan to scrape up any remnants from the bottom of the pan (can also use white wine or marsala). Remove from heat.\n6 Slice the roast: Use a sharp knife to slice the roast across the grain into 1/4 to 1/2-inch thick slices. Serve with the saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nBeef Brisket Pot Roast Recipe\nPrep time: 35 minutesCook time: 4 hours, 15 minutesYield: Serves 8-12\nINGREDIENTS\n4 to 5 pound (about 2 kg) beef brisket, flat cut or point cut\nSalt\n1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n3 large onions, sliced\n5 to 6 garlic cloves, minced\n1 sprig thyme\n1 sprig rosemary\n3 to 4 bay leaves\n2 cups beef stock\n2 to 3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces\n1 tablespoon mustard (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the brisket: On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.\nUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.\nSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n2 Sear the brisket: You\'ll need an ovenproof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\nPat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\nTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot. If not, add some olive oil.\nAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Saut\xc3\xa9, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1 to 2 more minutes.\n4 Simmer the brisket and roast it: Preheat the oven to 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C). Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.\nMove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop. Cover the pot, then place in the 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C) oven. Cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.\n5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\n6 Remove brisket: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.\n7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.\nTo make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into a blender, and pur\xc3\xa9e until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.\n8 Slice and serve: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the "grain" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices. (A sturdy bread knife works great for slicing roasts.)\nServe with the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles, or polenta.\nHello!

Pat dry with paper towels. Season generously with the salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.\nWhen the oil is hot, shimmering but not smoking, add the roast and cook, turning it a few times, until it is nicely browned on all sides, 10-12 minutes.\nTransfer the meat to a platter.\n2 Add vegetables: Reduce the heat to medium. Add the carrot, celery, and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are golden brown and begin to stick to the bottom of the pan, 10-12 minutes.\nAdd the garlic, parsley, and sage, and stir until the herbs are lightly colored and fragrant, about 1 minute.\n3 Deglaze the pan with wine, return meat to the pan: Add 1 cup of the wine and stir quickly, lifting up the richly browned caramelized vegetables that stick to the bottom of the pan.\nWhen the wine is almost all evaporated and thickly coats the vegetables, return the meat to the pan and turn it over a few times to coat it with the savory base.\n4 Add remaining ingredients, simmer until tender: Raise the heat to high, adding the remaining wine, the bay leaf, and the tomatoes, and bring to a boil. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, turning and basting the meat every half hour or so, until the meat is very tender and flakes away when pierced with a fork, 3-4 hours.\n5 Turn off the heat and let the roast sit in its juices for an hour. (You can also put the pot into a 300\xc2\xb0F oven and turn the roast every hour.)\n6 Remove meat, reduce sauce: Remove the meat from the pot and place it on a cutting board, covered loosely with aluminum foil. If the sauce is too thin, bring it to a fast boil and reduce it until it has a medium-thick consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning.\n7 Cut the meat into thick slices (it will probably fall apart), and place on warm serving dishes. Spoon the sauce over the meat and serve hot. Serve with rice, mashed potatoes, or polenta.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'
b'Save It Print\nSous Vide French Dip Sandwiches Recipe\nPrep time: 45 minutesCook time: 18 to 24 hoursYield: 6 to 8 sandwiches\nLook for top or bottom round roast for this recipe since these cuts are less fatty and easier to cut into thin slices. Use chuck roast if round roast can\'t be found and cut thicker slices.\nThe roast from this recipe is also fantastic for lunch sandwiches, tacos, salads, and any other recipe calling for tender slices of steak or beef.\nInstead of doing the second sear on the stovetop, try grilling it! This gives the meat a nice smoky flavor.\nMake-ahead instructions: Cook the roast as per the recipe through the end of the sous vide cook time. Lift the roast from the water and transfer it to a bowl of cold water to cool it down. Once cooled, refrigerate until ready to serve. Re-warm in a 140F sous vide bath for an hour or so, then continue with searing the roast and assembling the sandwiches.\nIf you don\'t have a sous vide immersion circulator: Cook the roast either in a Dutch oven (or heavy, covered pot) in the oven at 325\xc2\xb0 F for 3 to 4 hours, or in a slow cooker for 6 to 8 hours.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 pounds boneless beef top or bottom round roast\n1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste\n1 to 3 tablespoons cooking oil, like canola or grapeseed\n1/2 cup red wine\n2 cups low-sodium beef broth or stock\n1 bay leaf\nTo serve:\n1 large yellow onion, or 2 small yellow onions, thinly sliced (1 to 1 1/4 pounds)\n6 to 8 French rolls or hoagie buns\nSliced provolone cheese, optional\nSpecial equipment:\nJoule immersion circulator, or other immersion circulator\nLarge (8-quart or more) stock pot\nName-brand 1-gallon resealable plastic freezer bag, such as Ziploc\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Calculate your cooking time: This roast cooks sous vide for 18 to 24 hours, so it\'s important to begin cooking with your serving time in mind. Calculate backward from your dinner time to figure out when you should start cooking the roast.\nFor make-ahead instructions if you don\'t plan on serving your sandwiches right away, see the instructions in the headnotes.\n2 Trim and season the roast: Trim any large pieces of fat from the exterior of the roast, but don\'t worry about getting every last speck. Season it on all sides with the salt and pepper.\n3 Sear the roast: Warm a large skillet over medium-high heat and add 1 tablespoon of oil. When the oil shimmers and glides smoothly, and a flick of water evaporates on contact with the pan, add the roast.\nSear the roast very well on all sides, 4 to 5 minutes per side. The seared surfaces should look dark reddish-brown. If the oil starts to get smoky, lower the heat slightly; otherwise, maintain a medium-high heat for the best sear.\n4 Transfer the seared beef to a plate to cool slightly. If the roast is still scorching hot from the pan when you put it in the plastic bag, it can melt a hole in the plastic.\n5 Deglaze the pan with the wine: With the pan still over medium-high heat, add the wine all at once. It will bubble and steam as it hits the pan. As it bubbles, use a stiff spatula to scrape up any dark bits that were stuck.\nOnce you\'ve scraped up all the bits and the wine is simmering, pour it carefully into a measuring cup. Let it cool slightly.\n6 Pack up the roast for sous vide cooking: Place a 1-gallon plastic freezer bag on your counter and fold the top outwards to form a cuff; this will help it stand up and make it easier to fill. (Alternatively, place the bag in a bowl while filling).\nPlace the slightly cooled roast into the bag. Pour the wine and broth over top, and tuck the bay leaf inside. Zip the bag almost entirely shut, leaving about an inch open at one edge.\n7 Seal the bag: Fill a large stock pot three-quarters full with water. Submerge the bag with the roast until just the zipper part of the bag is above the water.\nAs you submerge the bag, the pressure of the water will press the sides of the plastic bag up against the roast and the liquid, "hugging" the ingredients. You may need to use your hands or a spatula to poke the roast below the surface of the water and force out any bubbles.\nOnce all the air bubble are out, submerge the bag up to the zipper, then zip it all the way closed so the bag is sealed. Lift the roast from the water and place it on a dishtowel while you heat the water.\nAs you lift the bag, the plastic should look like it\'s hugging the ingredients inside the bag. A few small air pockets are fine; vacuum-sealing isn\'t necessary. Check carefully to make sure the bag isn\'t leaking; if it is, transfer it to a new bag and repeat this sealing step.\nRead more about this method here.\n8 Heat the water with the immersion circulator: Place the pot of water on a trivet or other heatproof surface. Place the immersion circulator in the water and set it to heat the water based on your preferred doneness for the roast beef: 135\xc2\xb0F (medium-rare), 140\xc2\xb0F (medium), 145\xc2\xb0F (medium-well) or 150\xc2\xb0F (well-done).\nIt will take approximately 5 to 10 minutes for the water to heat, depending on the volume of water in your pot. (You can also use warm water out of the tap to cut down on heating time.) Once the water is up to temp, your immersion circulator will indicate that you\'re ready to start cooking.\nWith Joule, this is controlled through the Joule app: Open the app on your phone and press the orange circular button in the bottom right corner. Input the temperature and press the orange button again to start the device and begin heating the water.\n9 Cook the roast: Once the water has finished heating, lower the roast into the water. It\'s fine if the zipper is above the surface of the water, but the roast itself should be completely submerged by at least an inch or so. Add more water if needed.\nCook the roast for 18 to 24 hours (yes, hours!). It will become more tender the longer you let it cook. Set a timer so you know when it\'s ready.\n10 Check the roast and monitor the water during cooking: Every so often during cooking, take a peek at your roast and make sure that it\'s still submerged in the water and the bag isn\'t leaking. (If it\'s leaking, the liquid will start to look diluted and you\'ll notice air bubbles in the bag. Just transfer the roast and liquid to another bag and carry on with cooking. This doesn\'t happen very often, but is something to watch out for.)\nKeep an eye on the water level and add additional water if it looks like it\'s getting low. The immersion circulator will heat the water right back up to temperature. To help prevent evaporation, you can also cover your pot with plastic wrap, a silicon bowl cover (as I have), or any other cover.\n11 Cook the onions at any point while the roast is cooking: At any point during this cooking time when you have a spare 10 minutes, cook the onions. Warm a teaspoon or two of oil in a skillet and cook the onions with 1/4 teaspoon salt until they are very soft and browned.\nIf you\'re not serving them right away, cool and refrigerate until needed. To reheat, add them to a hot skillet and stir until warmed through.\n12 Sear the roast (again!): When you\'re done cooking the roast, lift the bag from the water and set it on a kitchen towel on the counter. Warm a tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.\nOpen the bag with the roast; be careful not to spill any of the cooking liquid. Use tongs to lift the roast from the bag and transfer it to a cutting board. Pat it dry on all sides.\nTransfer the roast to the hot skillet and sear on all sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side, until the outside is very crusty. Add more oil as needed to the pan. Once seared, set the roast on a cutting board until ready to slice.\n13 Strain the "jus": While the roast sears, strain the cooking liquid ("jus") into a measuring cup. Taste and add salt or pepper if needed. If the jus seems overly concentrated to you, add a little water to thin it out again.\nUse a little of the jus to deglaze the pan after searing the roast, if you like.\nTransfer the jus to individual cups for serving.\n14 Toast the French rolls: Warm the oven to 400F. Open up all the French rolls and arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet with the cut sides facing up. Toast in the hot oven until they are warm and feel crispy when you press the surface of the bread, about 5 minutes. Remove from the oven, but leave the oven on.\nIf you like, spoon a little of the beef jus over the bottom buns for flavor.\n15 Slice the beef: Use a sharp chef\'s knife and slice the beef against the grain as thinly as possible.\n16 Assemble the sandwiches: Pile slices of beef on the bottom half of the rolls. The meat should divide equally between all the rolls, but you may have some leftover.\nTop each pile of beef with some onions and a slice or two of cheese, if desired.\n17 Broil the sandwiches: Set aside the tops of the buns so they don\'t burn. Switch the oven to "broil" and slide the pan of sandwiches under the broiler. Broil until the cheese starts to melt, about 1 minute.\n18 Serve the sandwiches: Top each sandwich with the top bun. Serve with the jus alongside for dipping. (Refrigerate leftovers and consume within 3 to 4 days, or freeze for up to 3 months.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nBeef Roast Braised in Red Wine Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 3 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6\nINGREDIENTS\n1 (3 1/2 pound) chuck roast, boneless\nSalt and ground black pepper\n4 oz pancetta, cut into 1/4-inch cubes\n2 medium onions, chopped medium (about 2 cups)\n2 medium carrots, chopped medium (about 1 cup)\n2 ribs celery, chopped medium (1 cup)\n1 Tbsp tomato paste\n3 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)\n1 (750 ml) bottle Zinfandel wine (can substitute Cabernet Sauvignon, or other full bodied red wine)\n1 can (14 1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes, drained\n1 Tbsp chopped fresh oregano\n1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Salt the roast and let sit at room temp while you prep the vegetables: If your roast is very fatty, trim some of the fat. But it is important to keep some fat, as this will keep the roast moist while braising. In many supermarkets chuck roasts will already be properly trimmed.\nSalt the roast well and set aside at room temperature while you prepare all the other vegetables.\n2 Render fat and crisp the pancetta: Pour a little water into a Dutch oven or other heavy, lidded pot. Set the pot over medium heat and add the diced pancetta. As soon as the water begins to simmer, lower the heat to medium-low and slowly crisp up the pancetta; the water allows some of the fat in the pork to render out without charring the pancetta.\nWhen the pancetta is crispy and brown, remove it with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n3 Brown the roast on all sides: Preheat the oven to 300\xc2\xb0F. Pat the beef roast dry with a paper towel, increase the heat to medium and brown all sides in the pot.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 the chopped vegetables: Once the meat has browned remove it to a bowl and add the onions, carrot and celery. Sprinkle salt over the vegetables while they cook. Increase the heat to medium-high and saut\xc3\xa9 for 2-3 minutes.\nAdd the tomato paste and stir well, saut\xc3\xa9 for another 1-2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook a minute more.\n5 Add tomatoes, pancetta, herbs, wine, and the roast. Cover and cook: Increase the heat to high and add the tomatoes, the pancetta, herbs and red wine. Nestle the beef roast into the pot, cover, place in the 300\xc2\xb0F oven and cook for 3 hours. At the halfway point, use tongs to turn the beef roast over.\n6 Strain and reduce the sauce: Remove the pot from oven and transfer beef to a large bowl; tent with foil to keep warm. Allow the liquid to settle in the pot for a few minutes, if you'd like, skim off some of the fat with a wide shallow spoon. If you have an immersion blender, use it to blend the contents of the pot. If you don't, use a whisk to help break down the vegetables.\nBoil the sauce until it is reduced to about 3 1/2 cups. Strain liquid through large fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids with spatula to extract as much liquid as possible; you should have a couple cups strained sauce.\nAdd any accumulated juices from the bowl you have the beef in. Boil the sauce again until it has reduced to 1 1/2 cups. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.\n7 Slice the meat and serve with the sauce: Cut the meat into roughly 1/2-inch-thick slices and pour the sauce over them. Serve with a bold red wine and crusty bread or mashed potatoes.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Save It Print\nTraditional Roast Beef Hash Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 20 minutes\nTo make the hash you want approximately equal amounts of cooked beef, raw potato, and onion. The amounts listed here in the ingredient list are approximations. Scale up or down as needed.\nA grinder makes a big difference here because of the way it grinds the beef into the onions and potatoes.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups roughly chopped cooked roast beef or pot roast beef\n1 large Russett or 2 smaller Yukon gold potatoes, peeled and quartered\n1 large onion, peeled and quartered\n3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\nSalt and pepper\nKetchup\nMETHOD\n1 Grind the beef, potatoes, and onions together: Take approximately equal proportions of beef, potatoes, and onions and put them through a meat grinder using a medium grinder attachment so that they are well mixed and ground.\nIf you don't have a meat grinder, you can pulse a few times in a food processor, or finely chop by hand.\n2 Brown the hash: Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan, preferably a cast iron pan, on medium high to high heat.\nAdd the hash to the frying pan so that a half an inch of hash covers the bottom of the pan. If you have more hash to cook, do so in separate batches.\nBrown the hash, stirring only infrequently at first to make sure that the hash has an opportunity to brown well.\nAs you cook the hash, add pinches of salt and fresh ground pepper. Do this a couple of times with each batch of hash.\nCook for at least 10 minutes and until the hash is well browned.\nServe immediately with ketchup.\nHello!

Place steak in the bowl and coat on all sides with the marinade. Marinate for 20 minutes while you are preheating the grill.\n2 Prepare the grill: Prepare the grill for direct high heat. If you are using charcoal, use approximately 5 pounds of coals. Bank the coals so that more of them are on one side than the other, so that you have a high heat zone and a lower heat zone.\n3 Pat dry steak, sprinkle with salt and pepper: When the grill is ready and hot, remove the meat from the marinade and pat it dry with paper towels. Sprinkle generously all over with salt and freshly ground black pepper.\n4 Sear tri-tip on hot side of grill: Place the tri-tip on the hot side of the grill. Leave the cover off and watch carefully for flare-ups.\nAs the meat browns, any fat will melt and drip on to the coals causing flare-ups. These are okay, as long as they don't get out of control.\nKeep moving the tri-tip around the grill away from the flames if they get too high. Brown well on both sides.\n5 Move steak to lower heat side of grill: When the tri-tip steak is browned all over, move it to the lower heat side of the grill.\nCover the grill and close the vents enough so that you maintain about 300-325\xc2\xb0F temperature in the grill. (If you are using a charcoal grill, you can place a meat thermometer through the vents to measure the heat.)\nIf you are using a gas grill, turn off one of the burners and move the meat over that burner for indirect heating.\n6 Check temperature: Cook the tri-tip until a meat thermometer reads 130\xc2\xb0F when inserted into the thickest part of the meat (15-30 minutes, depending on the thickness of the meat).\n7 Let rest: Remove from grill, cover with foil and let rest for 15 minutes.\n8 Make salsa: Make the bell pepper salsa by stirring together all of the salsa ingredients in a small bowl.\n9 Slice: Cut the tri-tip in 1/4-inch slices across the grain of the meat. Serve with the bell pepper salsa.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"

b'Save It Print\nNew England Boiled Dinner Recipe\nCook time: 4 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nCorned beef can be pretty salty, so if you are making boiled dinner with corned beef you may want to put it in a pot, cover with cold water, bring to a boil, and then discard the water before starting the recipe. If the broth ends up being too salty, you can serve just the meat and vegetables, without the broth, or add water to the broth to dilute it.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 1/2 pounds corned beef brisket or plain beef brisket\n15 peppercorns\n8 whole cloves\n1 bay leaf\nSalt, if using plain brisket\n2 medium sized turnips, peeled and quartered\n4 red new potatoes, peeled and quartered\n3 large carrots, cut into thirds and the thickest pieces quartered lengthwise\n1 small head cabbage, cut into fourths\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Put corned beef in a pot, cover with water, add seasonings, simmer: Put the brisket in a 5 or 6 quart Dutch oven and cover with an inch of water.\nIf you are using corned beef brisket and it does not come already packed in seasoning, add peppercorns, cloves, and a bay leaf to the pot.\nIf using plain brisket, add a teaspoon of salt for every quart of water.\nBring to a simmer and then cover, lower the heat until it is barely simmering. Keep at a low simmer for four hours or until the meat is tender (a fork goes through easily).\n2 Remove meat, add vegetables, simmer: Remove the meat and set aside, keeping the meat warm. Add the vegetables to the pot. Check the broth for taste. If it is too salty, add a little more water to taste.\nRaise the temperature and bring the soup to a high simmer. Cook at a high simmer until done, about 15-30 minutes longer, depending on the size of the cut of your vegetables.\n\n3 Slice meat across the grain: Slice the meat in thin slices across the grain. You may find it easier to slice if you first cut the roast in half along the same direction as the grain of the meat. Then slice smaller lengths across the grain.\n\nServe in bowls, a few pieces of meat in each, add some of the vegetables and some broth. Serve with horseradish or mustard or both.\nHello!

After you add the liquid, bring it to a simmer on the stovetop then put it, tightly covered, in a 225\xc2\xb0F oven for 6 hours (or a 300\xc2\xb0F oven for 4 hours).\nNote that different people have different sensitivities to bitter flavors. If Guinness Stout tastes bitter to you, then the stew will taste bitter as well. If it doesn\'t taste bitter to you, the stew should not taste bitter.\nYou can either use celery root, young turnips, or potatoes in addition to parsnips and carrots. If you use turnips, make sure you only use young turnips, which are smaller and sweeter than regular turnips. Regular turnips can be quite bitter.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 Tbsp butter\n2 pounds (900 g) well marbled chuck beef roast, cut into 2-inch pieces\nSalt\n2 cups chopped onion (about 1 large onion)\n2 celery stalks, chopped\n2 Tbsp tomato paste\n1 pint (16 ounces, 475 ml) Guinness extra stout (make sure you use extra stout and not draught)\n3 cups (700 ml) beef broth\n2 large carrots, peeled and cut into chunks\n3 to 4 parsnips, peeled and cut into chunks\n1/2 pound (280 g) celery root, potatoes, or very young turnips, peeled and cut into chunks\n2 teaspoons dried thyme\n4 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart or larger slow cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the beef, transfer to slow cooker: Heat the butter in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium-high heat. Brown the beef in the butter, starting with the fattiest pieces of meat, fat side down in the pan. This will allow some beef fat to render out. Work in batches as to not crowd the pan.\nSprinkle salt over the beef as it browns. Once browned on all sides, transfer the beef pieces into a 6-quart or larger slow cooker.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions and celery, transfer to slow cooker: Add the onions and celery to the pan in which you just browned the beef. Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions and celery until they begin to brown at the edges, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the tomato paste and mix well. Cook for a minute or two, then add a little of the Guinness, enough to make it easier for you to scrape up any browned bits at the bottom of the pan.\nTransfer the celery and onions into the slow cooker.\n3 Add Guinness, broth, root vegetables, thyme, salt: Add the rest of the Guinness, the beef broth, carrots, parsnips, celery root, and thyme to the slow cooker. Add two teaspoons of salt.\n4 Cook in slow cooker: Cover and cook on "high" for 4 hours, or "low" for 8 hours. When done, add more salt to taste.

Cook until the onions begin to soften and turn translucent, about 4 minutes. Stir in the tomato paste and cook for another minute.\n3 Add the liquids to the pot: Pour in the Guinness. Use a stiff spatula to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot. Let it simmer for five minutes to reduce the beer a bit, then stir in the reserved beef, beef broth, and thyme.\n4 Pressure cook the meat: Secure the lid on the pressure cooker and make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s set to its \xe2\x80\x9csealing\xe2\x80\x9d position. Cancel the cooking program, then select the Meat/Stew,\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cPressure Cook,\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cManual\xe2\x80\x9d setting, and set the cooking time to 30 minutes at high pressure. (The pot will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure before the actual cooking time begins.)\nWhen the cooking program finishes, let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then release the remaining pressure by moving the pressure vent to its \xe2\x80\x9cventing\xe2\x80\x9d position.\nAt this point, you may also leave the stew on the \xe2\x80\x9cKeep Warm\xe2\x80\x9d setting for up to 10 hours, before continuing with the rest of the recipe. The beef will become more tender the longer it sits.\n5 Add the root vegetables and pressure cook: When the pressure has released, open the pot. (Optional: for a leaner stew, you can use a ladle or spoon to skim off some of the fat.) Stir in the carrots, parsnips, and root vegetables.\nPut the lid back on the pressure cooker and make sure it\xe2\x80\x99s set to its \xe2\x80\x9csealing\xe2\x80\x9d position. Cancel the cooking program, then select the \xe2\x80\x9cPressure Cook\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cManual\xe2\x80\x9d setting and set the cooking time to 3 minutes at high pressure.  (The pot will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure before the actual cooking time begins.)\n6 While the stew is finishing, mix the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl to make a slurry.\n7 Finish the stew: When the cooking program ends, perform a quick pressure release by moving the pressure vent to its \xe2\x80\x9cventing\xe2\x80\x9d position. (It\'s also ok if you need to leave the stew on the "Warm" setting for a little while before venting the pressure and serving, though the vegetables will eventually start to get mushy if left too long.)\nStir in the cornstarch slurry right away while stew is still bubbling. The residual heat will thicken the stew within a couple minutes.\n8 Serve: Ladle the stew into bowls and serve it hot, with fresh parsley sprinkled on top.\nHello!

b"Print\nBeef Bourguignon Recipe\nYield: Serves 6-8\nWe are using shiitake mushrooms for the fresh mushrooms in this recipe, even though they are not traditionally used for this dish, because they are just so meaty and good. Feel free to use any fresh mushroom you'd like.\nIf you don't have access to salt pork, you can use bacon, but simmer it first for 8 minutes in water, then drain and rinse, to remove its smokiness. A word on salt. Salt pork is salty. Be sparing with salt as you make this dish until the end, when you can adjust. Commercial beef stock is also salty, so you very well may have enough salt for the dish just from these two sources.\nINGREDIENTS\n6-8 ounces salt pork, cut into 1/2 inch chunks\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided\n4 pounds trimmed beef chuck, cut into 2-inch cubes, patted dry with paper towels\nSalt\n10-12 shallots, chopped, about 2 cups\n2 large, peeled carrots, 1 chopped, 1 cut into 2-inch chunks\n4-5 garlic cloves, chopped\n1 ounce of dried porcini mushrooms (optional)\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n1/2 cup brandy, plus 2 tablespoons\n1 bottle Pinot Noir, or other red wine\nBeef Stock (low sodium), at least 1 cup, quite easily more\n1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley\n2 bay leaves\n2 teaspoons dried thyme\n4 whole cloves\n24 pearl onions, fresh or frozen\n1 pound fresh shiitake, cremini or button mushrooms\nBeurre manie: 3 tablespoons flour blended with 2 tablespoons butter\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Rehydrate dried porcini mushrooms: If you are using the dried porcini mushrooms, pour 1 cup of boiling water over the them and allow them to rehydrate for 30 minutes. Remove the mushrooms and chop coarsely. Pour the soaking water through a paper towel (to remove any dirt or debris) into a bowl and set aside.\n2 Cook the salt pork: In a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan, pour enough water to cover the bottom by about 1/8 inch. Over medium heat, cook the salt pork in the pan until the water evaporates, stirring occasionally.\nOnce the water is gone, reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue to cook the salt pork until much of the fat has rendered out of it. Add a tablespoon of butter and continue to cook the salt pork until the pieces are browned and crispy.\nUse a slotted spoon to remove the salt pork pieces to a large Dutch oven or other large, thick-bottomed, lidded pot.\n3 Brown the beef: Increase the heat to medium-high. Working in batches so that you do not crowd the pan, brown the beef.\nLeaving space around each piece of sizzling meat ensures that it browns and does not steam. Don't move the pieces of beef in the pan until they get a good sear, then turn them so they can get browned on another side.\nTake your time. This will take 15-25 minutes, depending on how large a saut\xc3\xa9 pan you have.\nOnce browned, remove the beef from the saut\xc3\xa9 pan and place in the Dutch oven with the salt pork.\n4 Cook the shallots, carrot, chopped porcini, then add garlic and tomato paste: When all the beef has browned and removed from the pan, add the shallots, the one chopped carrot, and the chopped porcini mushrooms if using.\nStir in the pot to remove any browned, stuck-on bits in the pan. Cook for 2-3 minutes, then add the garlic and the tomato paste. Cook another 2-3 minutes, stirring frequently.\n5 Add brandy, mushroom soaking water: Add the brandy and stir to combine. Boil down by half, then add the strained mushroom soaking water (if using).\nScrape any remaining browned bits off the bottom of the saut\xc3\xa9 pan and pour the contents of the pan into the Dutch oven.\n6 Simmer beef with wine, stock, herbs: To the Dutch oven add the bottle of wine and enough beef stock to almost cover the beef; the beef pieces should be barely poking up out of the liquid. Add the parsley, bay leaves, thyme and cloves. Cover and bring to a bare simmer for 1 hour.\n7 Add carrot: After 1 hour, add the second carrot, peeled and cut into chunks of 1-2 inches. Continue cooking for another hour, or until the beef is tender.\n8 Prep the mushrooms and onions: While the stew is cooking, trim the tough stems off the shiitake, cremini, or button mushrooms and slice into 2-3 large pieces; small mushrooms leave whole.\nPrepare the pearl onions. Boil them in their skins for 4-5 minutes. Drain and submerge in a bowl of ice water. Slice the tips and root ends off the onions and slip off the outer skins.\n9 Start on the sauce: When the beef is tender, use tongs to remove all the beef and the chunks of carrots; set aside in a bowl. Strain the contents of the Dutch oven through a fine-meshed sieve set over a medium pot. This will be the sauce.\nBoil the sauce down, tasting frequently. If it begins to taste too salty, turn off the heat. Otherwise, boil down until you have about 3 cups. Turn off the heat.\n10 Cook mushrooms and onions: Heat a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over high heat and add the mushrooms. Dry saut\xc3\xa9 the mushrooms over high heat, shaking the pan and stirring often, until they release their water, about 4-5 minutes.\nAdd the pearl onions and 3 tablespoons butter and toss to combine. Sprinkle salt over the onions and mushrooms. Saut\xc3\xa9 until the onions begin to brown. Remove from heat.\n11 Finish the sauce: Returning to the sauce, reduce the heat to medium and whisk in the beurre manie. Whisk in a third of the paste, wait for it to incorporate into the sauce, then add another third of the beurre manie, and so on. Do not let this boil, but allow it to simmer very gently for 2-3 minutes.\nStir in the remaining 2 tablespoons of brandy. Taste for salt and add some if needed.\n12 Serve: To serve, coat the beef, carrots, mushrooms and pearl onions with the sauce and serve with potatoes, egg noodles or lots of crusty bread.\nHello!

Set the heat to medium and cook the bacon until much of the fat has been rendered. Remove bacon to a paper-towel lined plate.\nPour off all but 1 Tbsp of the bacon fat from pot. (Do not pour down the drain or you will clog your drain when the fat hardens as it cools.)\n2 Dredge the short ribs: Preheat oven to 300\xc2\xb0F. While the bacon is cooking, in a large bowl, whisk together the flour, hot paprika, smoked paprika, 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of black pepper. Dredge the short ribs in the flour mixture.\n3 Brown the short ribs in the bacon fat: Add the short ribs to the pot with the bacon fat, taking care to not crowd the pot (work in batches if necessary). Brown on all sides, about 3 to 5 minutes per side.\nIf you want to get good browning, do not stir the short ribs unless to turn.\nWhile the short ribs are browning, chop the bacon and set aside.\n4 Cook the onions and garlic: Use tongs or a slotted spoon to remove the short ribs from the pot to a bowl. Add the chopped onions to the pot. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cook until translucent, about 4 minutes.\nAdd the garlic and cook for an additional minute.\n5 Add ale and tomatoes: Add the ale and, using a wooden spoon or spatula, scrape up any browned bits on the bottom of the pan.\nAdd tomatoes and their juices and reserved bacon.

(Alternatively, you can do the cooking on the stovetop, just lower the heat to the lowest setting and cover.)\n7 Add the root vegetables: Peel potatoes, turnips (optional), and carrots, and cut into 1-in. pieces. Add to short ribs, cover, and cook until the vegetables are tender and meat pulls away easily from the bone, about 30-45 minutes. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n8 Remove bones, excess fat: Spoon off excess fat (it helps if you have a fat separator). If you want, remove the bones before serving and cut any big pieces of meat into smaller chunks.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nSous Vide Beef Tenderloin with Port Wine and Garlic Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 2 hours, 30 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nOne and half pounds of beef will comfortably feed four people; two pounds will feed six. You can stretch it to feed a few more people if you are serving the tenderloin with several other dishes on the table.\nWhen buying your tenderloin roast, make sure the butcher removes the silver skin. Also ask them to truss the roast with twine. You can do both of these steps yourself, but it\'s one less thing for you to worry about back home!\nINGREDIENTS\n1 1/2 to 2 pounds center-cut beef tenderloin (See Recipe Note)\n1 teaspoon salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil, divided\n2 tablespoons butter\n1/2 cup tawny port wine\n4 to 5 medium cloves garlic\n5 to 6 sprigs fresh thyme, plus extra to serve\nSpecial equipment:\n10-inch stainless steel or cast iron skillet\nJoule, or other sous vide immersion circulator\n1-gallon zip-top freezer bag\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Sear the beef tenderloin: Sprinkle the tenderloin with salt and a generous amount of pepper. Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a 10-inch skillet over medium-high heat. When the pan is hot enough, a drop of water should sizzle and quickly evaporate on contact.\nSear the tenderloin in the pan until it\'s dark brown all over, 1 to 2 minutes on each side and both ends. Transfer to a plate or cutting board and allow to cool slightly.\n2 Make the port-garlic sauce: While the pan is still hot, add the butter and garlic. Cook until the garlic is golden and fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds.\nAdd the port wine and use a stiff spatula to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Let the wine come to a simmer, then remove from heat.\n3 Seal the tenderloin in a zip-top freezer bag: Make sure the tenderloin and sauce are no longer steaming. It\'s fine if they are still quite warm, but they can melt through the bag if they\'re still steaming hot.\nPlace a gallon-sized zip-top freezer bag on your counter and flip the zip-top edge outward, forming a cuff around the bag. This helps the bag stay open and upright as you fill it.\nTransfer the tenderloin to the bag and pour the sauce over top. Lay 5 or 6 sprigs of thyme over the top of the tenderloin.\nFill a stock pot with 5 or 6 inches of water. Slowly submerge the tenderloin in the water, using your hands to help push out all the air from the bag as you go. When you reach the top of the bag, zip it closed.\nLift the tenderloin out of the water and place it on a towel while you heat the water for the sous vide.\nRead more about this method here.\n4 Heat the water for sous vide cooking: Place your Joule or other sous vide immersion circulator in the stockpot of water. Set the sous vide immersion circulator to heat the water to 133\xc2\xb0F for rare beef, 140F for medium-rare (my preference), 149\xc2\xb0F for medium-well, or 167\xc2\xb0F for well-done.\n5 Cook the tenderloin sous vide for 2 1/2 to 3 hours: When the water has heated to its required temperature, lower the tenderloin into the water so that it is entirely submerged. It\'s ok if the top of the bag pokes out of the water as long as the tenderloin itself is submerged.\nCook for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, but avoid cooking for much longer or the beef will start to get a little soft and mushy.\n6 Sear the tenderloin a second time: When the tenderloin is done, lift it from the water and place the bag on a kitchen towel. Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil in the skillet over medium-high heat until a drop of water sizzles and evaporates on contact.\nUse tongs to lift the roast from the bag and transfer it to the skillet. Be careful\xe2\x80\x94it will sputter! Sear for 30 to 60 seconds on all sides, until the outside is even more deeply browned and a crust has formed.\nTransfer the tenderloin to a cutting board and rest for 5 to 10 minutes.\n7 Deglaze the pan: With the pan still over medium-high heat, pour in the sauce directly from the bag into the pan (discard the sprigs of thyme). Simmer for about a minute and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pan. Carefully transfer the sauce to a serving cup.\n8 Slice and serve the tenderloin: Cut through the twine and discard. Slice the tenderloin either into thick "filet mignon" steaks (one steak per person), or into thinner "roast beef" slices (3 or 4 slices per person). Serve immediately with the sauce.\nHello!

If you don't have a grill, or this isn't grilling season, you can also put all ingredients into a casserole dish and bake in a 350\xc2\xb0F oven for 1 1/2 hours.\nINGREDIENTS\n2-3 pounds kielbasa, Polish sausage or bratwurst\n1 to 2 light-colored (not dark) beers\n1 to 1 1/2 pints of sauerkraut\n2 medium yellow onions, thickly sliced\n2 Tbsp vegetable oil\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon celery seed\n1 Tbsp. caraway seed\nMustard\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Grill the sausages slowly over medium heat, allowing them to get well browned. Be patient; do not be tempted to grill the links over high heat, or they will break open and the juices and fat will drain into the grill (they may break open anyway, but they'll break less if you cook them slowly).\n2 Heat the beer with celery seed and caraway seeds: While the sausages are cooking, put an aluminum grilling pan on a cooler part of the grill and pour in the beer. Stir in the celery and caraway seeds and salt. Bring to a simmer. (This may require covering the grill.)\n3 Add sausages and sauerkraut: Once the sausages are browned add the sausages, the sauerkraut and sauerkraut juices to the pan.\n4 Grill the onions: Paint the sliced onion with the vegetable oil and grill on high direct heat. If your grates are too wide and you think you will lose too much onion through the grates, you can either skip the grilling part and put the onions directly into the beer bath, or you can cut the onions in halves or quarters and grill them that way.\nThen slice them and add them to the beer.\n5 Cover the grill and simmer (a low simmer, not a boil) for 30 minutes to 2 hours before serving. Cut the sausages into serving sized pieces before serving.\nServe as is in a bowl or on a plate, or in a sandwich roll. Serve with mustard on the side.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nRabbit Braised in Belgian Ale Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 15 minutesYield: Serves 4\nMany markets carry whole frozen rabbits. Call ahead to have your butcher defrost and cut rabbit into parts. Otherwise, defrost by by placing into a large bowl of cool water. Once thawed, cut into parts (see these instructions). Try to remove any stray little bones at the edges of some of the cuts of rabbit.\nThe dish works best with a Belgian ale. If not available, try Newcastle brown ale or Anchor Steam ale, or O-Doule amber ale if you need to avoid alcohol. Do not attempt this recipe with a hoppy beer.\nINGREDIENTS\nOne 2 1/2 to 3 pound rabbit, cut into 6 to 7 serving pieces (2 front legs, 2 back legs, the loin cut into 2 to 3 pieces), plus ribs and flap meat\nSalt\n1/2 cup all purpose flour for dredging\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons butter\n2 medium onions, sliced stem to root (about 2 1/2 cups sliced)\n4-6 whole cloves of garlic, peeled\n6 sprigs of fresh thyme, tied together with kitchen string (or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme)\n1 1/2 cups of Belgian ale, such as Chimay or Ommengang\n1/2 cup of chicken stock\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 celery root, peeled and diced\n2 teaspoons whole grained mustard\n2 teaspoons brown sugar\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Sprinkle rabbit pieces with salt: Place rabbit pieces on a platter, sprinkle both sides with kosher salt. Let sit for 30 minutes to an hour.\n2 Dredge rabbit with flour, brown in butter: Place flour on plate. Dredge rabbit pieces in flour.\nHeat oil and butter in a large  Dutch oven on medium heat (large enough to fit rabbit pieces in a single layer). Once the butter is melted and foamy, add the rabbit pieces in a single layer to the pot.\nBrown on one side without stirring for 5 to 6 minutes. Then turn the pieces over and brown on the other side. Remove to a plate.\n3 Brown the onions, add garlic and thyme: Add the sliced onions to the pot, and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly brown, scraping up and browned rabbit bits from the bottom of the pot. Add garlic cloves and thyme, cook until onions are soft and the garlic quite fragrant.\n4 Add ale, then stock, salt, pepper: Increase the heat to high and add the Belgian ale. Let it simmer for a minute or two, then add the stock. Add a half teaspoon of salt and the freshly ground black pepper.\n5 Add celery root, rabbit, then simmer: Place the diced celery root over the onions in a single layer. Place the browned rabbit pieces over the  celery root. Bring to a simmer. Cover and reduce heat to maintain a very low simmer. Cook for 45 minutes, or until the rabbit is just cooked through and tender.\n6 Reduce sauce: Remove rabbit pieces from the pot and keep warm on a platter. Increase the heat to high and reduce the liquid by one third. Then, reduce the heat to low, stir in the mustard and sugar. Taste and add more salt and pepper in needed.\n7 Return meat to sauce in pot: Slice the flap meat pieces of the rabbit into strips and return to the pot. Strip away any available meat from the back and chest parts and return meat to the pot. Add the serving pieces to the pot. Cover and let rewarm for a minute.\n8 Serve: Sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve. Serve with crusty bread, egg noodles, or rice pilaf, along with some Belgian ale.\nHello!

b"Print\nBeer Braised Chicken and Onions Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 2 hoursYield: Serves 6-8\nWhat beer you use matters. Dark beers tend to be more full bodied and malty and sweet. They will work well in this stew. Hoppy beers like IPA or pale ale are too bitter for this stew and should be avoided.\nFor this recipe we've used Moylan's Kilt Lifter, a Scottish ale, and also Ommegang Abbey Ale. A soft Belgian beer like Flanders Red or one of the Chimay beers would also be ideal.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 Tbsp unsalted butter\n6 chicken thighs, about 2 to 2 1/2 pounds\nSalt\n3 pounds yellow onions, sliced 1/4-inch thick, root to stem, about 6-8 cups sliced\n1 Tbsp brown sugar, packed\n2 bay leaves\n2 teaspoons dried thyme\n2 Tbsp smooth Dijon mustard\n1 1/2 cups dark beer\n1 cup chicken stock\nFreshly ground black pepper\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the chicken thighs on all sides: Melt the butter in a large, heavy pot with a lid, such as a Dutch oven, over medium-high heat. Pat the chicken thighs dry with paper towels and set them skin side down in the butter. Salt the meat side lightly.\nBrown the chicken on both sides well. Remove the browned thighs from the pan and set aside in a bowl.\n2 Drain off some of the fat: The chicken skin has likely rendered quite a bit of fat. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons of fat from the pan, taking care to not discard any of the tasty browned bits. (Note, do not discard the fat down the drain, you may clog your plumbing. Pour off into a jar.)\n3 Cook the onions: Lower the heat to medium and add the sliced onions to the pan. If you want, sprinkle brown sugar over the onions. This is optional. The added sugar will intensify the natural sweetness of the onions.\nCook the onions slowly, stirring occasionally, until they begin to brown, about 15 minutes.\n4 Add herbs mustard, salt, beer, stock, chicken, bring to simmer: Add the bay leaves, thyme, mustard, 2 teaspoons of salt, and beer to the onions. Scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon. Add the chicken thighs and the chicken stock and bring to a simmer.\n5 Cook until chicken is falling off the bone tender: Cook covered for 45 minutes, then uncover the pot and simmer well until the liquid is greatly reduced and the meat wants to fall off the bone, between 45 minutes and 1 hour.\nIf you are using unsalted or low sodium stock, you will likely need to add more salt. Add freshly ground black pepper and more salt to taste.\nServe over egg noodles or with rice or potatoes.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Spread the root vegetables out over the pans in a single layer, with some space in between so that the vegetables don't crowd each other too much and the hot oven air can circulate around the vegetables. (You'll get better browning that way.) Pour the remaining vinaigrette over the root vegetables in the pans.\n3 Roast the vegetables: Place vegetables in the oven and roast at 450\xc2\xb0F for 35 to 40 minutes, turning the pans (and swapping bottom and top rack positions), half-way through the cooking.

b"Save It Print\nYeasted Belgian Waffles Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 5 minutesRise time: 8 to 24 hoursYield: 6 waffles (6 servings)\nMaking the batter overnight means you can have incredibly crisp and flavorful waffles without a lot of fuss in the morning. Just make sure to use a large container, as the batter more than doubles in size as it rises overnight.\nYou'll need a Belgian waffle maker with deep wells for this recipe. If you don't have a Belgian waffle maker (or aren't sure), just err on the side of caution and add a little less batter so your waffle iron doesn't overflow as the waffles cook.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the waffle batter:\n1 3/4 cups whole milk\n2 1/4 teaspoon (7g) active yeast (or 1 package, not fast acting or instant)\n2 cups (280g) all-purpose flour\n1/4 cup (40g) yellow cornmeal\n1 tablespoon brown sugar\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted\n2 large eggs\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\nFor topping:\nPowdered sugar, optional\nMaple syrup\nWhipped cream\nFresh fruit\nJam or preserves of your choice\nSpecial equipment:\nBelgian Waffle Iron\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the batter: Warm the milk up on the stovetop until it is warm to the touch, but not hot. (This should only take about 5 to 10 seconds on a gas or induction stovetop; an electric will take slightly longer.) Remove from heat and pour into a large mixing bowl. Add the yeast and stir to dissolve. Let the mixture sit for 5 minutes to proof. You should see a few bubbles form at the top.\nAdd the flour, cornmeal, brown sugar, and salt to the yeasted milk. Stir with a large spatula, and as the dry ingredients become incorporated into the batter, drizzle the melted butter over the entire mixture, stirring constantly. Stir until all the dry ingredients are absorbed and then cover the bowl with plastic wrap.\n2 Let the batter sit on the counter overnight, up to 8 hours.\n3 The next day, preheat your waffle iron. Spray your waffle iron lightly with cooking oil.\nAlso, preheat your oven to 250\xc2\xb0F for the finished waffles. Place a wire metal rack on a rimmed baking sheet and put in the oven\xe2\x80\x94or directly onto the oven rack itself.\n4 Make the waffles: The batter will have more than doubled in size after resting. Whisk in the eggs and baking soda. This will deflate the batter.\nPour 3/4 cup (or the manufacturer\xe2\x80\x99s suggested amount) of batter into the waffle maker, making sure it fills all the crevices. Close and cook the waffle to your preferred toasty level.\n5 Keep the waffles warm until serving: Once the waffle is done, move the waffle to the warm oven, on the wire racked baking sheet and repeat the process until all the batter is used and waffles made. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar, maple syrup on the side, or whatever topping you choose!\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Pour 1 tablespoon of the olive oil into an 9x13 baking dish and use your hand, or a brush, to grease the bottom and sides of the dish. This oil will help create a crisp crust on the bottom of the baked potatoes.\n2 Prep and start baking the potatoes: Thinly slice the potatoes to about 1/8-inch thick; use a mandoline if needed. Try to keep the potato slices together as you cut as this makes it easier to assemble them in the dish.\nFan the potatoes slightly in the dish, overlapping them like a fallen set of dominoes in the pan and creating four rows of potatoes. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and an 1/8 teaspoon of the black pepper.\nBake the potatoes for 30 minutes.\n3 Make the vinaigrette: Combine the vinegar, 2 tablespoons olive oil, both mustards, rosemary, garlic, and the remaining salt and pepper in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid (or in a bowl).\nShake the ingredients together vigorously until combined. If you\xe2\x80\x99re making the dressing in a bowl, use a whisk or an immersion blender to combine. Set this aside.\n4 Add the peppers, onions, and sausage to the dish: Carefully remove the dish of potatoes from the oven and evenly arrange the peppers, then the onions, and lastly, the sausage, on top of the potatoes.\nGive the dressing another vigorous shake and pour evenly over the top of the casserole.\n5 Bake the dish: Return the dish to the oven and bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the middle of a potato offers no resistance.\n6 Cool and serve: Remove the dish from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before serving. Leftovers will keep in a covered container for up to two days in the fridge.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

If you skip this step, the sauce will become too acidic. Soak for 10-15 minutes before proceeding.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions: Heat the olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat. Add the chopped onion and saut\xc3\xa9, stirring from time to time, until it is wilted and translucent, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle some salt over the onions as they cook.\n3 Add garlic and sage, then anchovies, then tomato paste: Add the garlic and sage, mix well, and saut\xc3\xa9 another minute. Mix in the anchovies, smashing them up, and cook for 1 more minute.\nStir in the tomato paste and cook for 2-3 minutes, stirring often, until the paste begins to turn a brick red.\n4 Add wine, roasted peppers, then simmer: Add the red wine and stir well.

Stir in the roasted red peppers and turn the heat back down to medium.\nLet this simmer for 10-20 minutes \xe2\x80\x93 it\xe2\x80\x99s pretty forgiving at this point. You just want the peppers to be cooked through and soft.\n5 Pur\xc3\xa9e: Pur\xc3\xa9e the sauce in a blender. You might need to do this in batches, because you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to fill your blender more than 2/3 up at one time.\nPur\xc3\xa9e the sauce, starting with the machine on low for 1-2 minutes to break up the big pieces. Turn off the blender and scrape the sides down. Turn it on again, and starting at the low setting, bring it up to its highest setting. Pur\xc3\xa9e for at least a minute, until smooth.\n6 Add spices: Return the sauce to the pan and heat to medium-low. Taste for salt and add some if needed. Add the cayenne or hot paprika, along with smoked paprika if you have some. If you want, a teaspoon of sugar helps, too, if your peppers are not already sweet enough. Keep the sauce warm while you make the pasta.\n7 Make the pasta according to the package instructions, depending on the type of pasta you are using.\n8 Serve pasta with sauce: To serve, drain the cooked pasta and put it into a large bowl. Ladle some sauce over the pasta and mix with tongs to combine. You want to coat all the noodles evenly. Divide into servings. Garnish with some grated cheese and minced fresh sage.

b'Save It Print\nMarinated Roasted Red Bell Peppers Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 40 minutesWater bath time: 15 minutesYield: Makes 3 pint jars\nRecipe adapted from Eugenia Bone\'s fabulous canning book Well-Preserved and a marinated pepper recipe from University of Minnesota.\nUser water bath method instructions if canning for shelf storage, otherwise just use clean jars and lids and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 pounds firm, fresh, clean red bell peppers\n1 cup bottled lemon juice*\n2 cups white vinegar (5%)\n1 cup extra virgin olive oil + additional for roasting the peppers\n2 cloves garlic, quartered\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n3 pint canning jars\n*Bottle lemon juice has a consistent level of acidity which you need for this canning recipe.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare water bath and mason jars if canning: If you are canning for shelf storage (and not just chilling in the refrigerator), place a steaming rack at the bottom of a large (12-qt) pot, add the empty mason jars that you will be using for canning.\nFill the pot with enough water to cover the jars and bring to a boil. It takes a while to get a large pot of water to boil, so while the water is heating, proceed with the recipe.\n2a Blacken Peppers, Broiler Method Position rack in oven so that the top surface of bell peppers placed in the oven will be 4-5 inches from the broiler heat element. Rub the surface of the peppers with a little olive oil (this will help them blister faster).\nPreheat broiler on high. Place peppers either directly on the top oven rack, with a pan to catch the drippings on a rack beneath, or place on a aluminum-foil or Silpat lined broiler pan (a cookie sheet will warp).\nAs the surface of the peppers blister and blacken, turn them with tongs so that they will blacken on all sides.\n2b Blacken Peppers, Stovetop Method If you have a gas range (or grill) you can place the peppers directly on the range top so that the flames lick the peppers. Work carefully so that as soon as one section of a pepper is blackened, you turn it to work on a fresh side.\nIf you have an electric stove, heat a cast iron pan on high and place the peppers in the pan, allowing the peel to blister and blacken, turning so that all sides get blackened.\n3 Remove blackened peel: When the peppers are all well blistered and blackened, place in a non-reactive bowl and cover. (The steam from the hot peppers will help dislodge the skins.)\nOnce the peppers have cooled enough to handle, work with them one by one over a plate, gently peel off the blackened skins.\nCut the peppers in half and remove and discard the seed pods, stems and all seeds.\n4 Heat lemon juice, white vinegar, olive oil, garlic, and salt, in a saucepan until boiling.\n5 Sterilize the lids: If canning for shelf storage, remove some boiling water from the pot of boiling water in step one and place into a bowl. Put the lids in that bowl.\n6 Distribute peppers and vinegar mixture in jars: Use tongs or a jar lifter to remove mason jars from the boiling water in step 1 (if canning). Distribute the peppers evenly among the jars. Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the peppers to cover (try to make sure some garlic gets in each jar).\nLeave 1/2-inch head space on the jars. Wipe the rims with a clean, dampened paper towel. Place on lids and rings (do not tighten rings too tight).\nAt this point you can store in the refrigerator for several weeks. If you want longer storage, or shelf storage, proceed.\n7 Water bath for canning: Place filled jars in boiling water on a rack (from step 1). (Helps to use tongs and wear thick rubber gloves). Water should cover jars by at least an inch. Boil for 15 minutes.\nLet cool in pot for several minutes, remove. Let cool completely. You should hear the jars "pop" as the lids seal.\nIf a jar does not seal, store it in the refrigerator and use up within a few weeks. Otherwise the jars should last a year.\nHello!

b"Print\nEggplant and Red Pepper Terrine Recipe\nUse high-quality, soft, fresh Mozzarella (the kind packed in water in the refrigerated section of the grocery store).\nINGREDIENTS\nTerrine ingredients:\n3 large red bell peppers (about 1 1/2 pounds)\n2 large, firm eggplants (about 2 1/2 pounds)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 1/2 cups loosely-packed flat-leaf parsley leaves\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n8 oz of fresh Mozzarella, cut into 1/8-in slices, about 14 slices\nRaw tomato sauce:\n3 cloves of garlic, peeled and finely chopped\n2 to 3 ripe tomatoes (1 1/4 pounds), each cut into 6 to 8 pieces\n1/4 cup virgin olive oil\n2 Tbsp red wine vinegar\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/4 teaspoon Tabasco sauce\nMETHOD\n1 Blacken and peel the red peppers: Arrange the red peppers on a broiling pan and place them under a hot broiler so that their upper surfaces are about 1/2 inch from the heat.\nBroil for 15 minutes, turning occasionally, until the peppers are blistered and black on all sides. (You can alternatively blacken the peppers directly over the open flame of a gas cook-top, holding them and turning them with tongs.)\nPlace them in a bowl and cover the bowl with a plate. Let the peppers steam in their own residual heat inside the bowl for 10 minutes. Then peel them (the skin will slide off) and remove the seeds.\nNote that Trader Joe's makes an excellent bottled cooked red pepper that can be used as a shortcut to the above step.\n2 Grill the eggplants: Heat a grill or grill pan until very hot. Cut the eggplants into 1/2-inch slices and lay out flat on a large flat surface such as a baking pan. Brush the slices on both sides with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt.\nCook the eggplant slices on the grill, covered, for 4 minutes on each side, until they are nicely browned and softened. If your grill does not have a lid, make a tent-like lid of aluminum foil and place it over the eggplant as it cooks.\n3 Blanch the parsley: While the eggplant is grilling, soften the parsley by blanching it in boiling water for 5 to 10 seconds. Remove, cool under cold water, drain.\n4 Build the terrine: Line a terrine mold (loaf pan) with plastic wrap. Arrange a layer of eggplant in the bottom of the mold and top it with about a third each of the red pepper pieces, parsley, and cheese.\nRepeat, beginning and ending with a layer of eggplant, until all the ingredients are used.\nCover with plastic wrap and press down on the wrap to compact the mixture. Refrigerate.\nAt this point you can make the terrine in advance and store in the refrigerator until you are ready to serve it.\n5 Prepare the sauce: Place the garlic and tomatoes in a blender and blend until smooth. Push the mixture through a food mill (fitted with a fine screen) over a bowl. Add the remainder of the sauce ingredients. Mix well.\n6 Serve: To serve, pour some of the sauce on a large platter and un-mold the terrine in the center. Cut it into slices and serve with the remainder of the sauce.\nHello!

Then lower the heat to medium low, add the sausages, and cook, turning the sausages occasionally, until the sausages are cooked through.\nTowards the end of cooking, baste with the honey balsamic mixture.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 large red onion, cut into wedges*\n2 large red bell peppers, seeded and cut into thirds\n1 pound sweet Italian sausage links\nExtra virgin olive oil\nSalt\n3 Tbsp honey\n3 Tbsp balsamic vinegar\n2 to 3 handfuls of baby arugula\n*Cut the onion wedges so that the root end is still intact on each wedge. It will make the onion wedges easier to grill and help keep them from falling apart on the grill.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the grill.\n2 Mix together the balsamic vinegar and honey in a small bowl and set aside.\n3 Grill the onions: Coat the onions with a little olive oil, and sprinkle with salt. Coat the grill grates with a little olive oil. Put the onion wedges on the grill and cover the grill.\nLet the onions roast for 5 minutes, or until they are a little charred. Turn the onions and move them to a cooler part of the grill to finish.\n4 Grill the sausages and peppers: Coat the sausages and peppers with olive oil. Sprinkle salt on the peppers. If your grill has two levels, place the sausages on the top part of the grill and the peppers directly below them.\nDone this way, as the sausages drip juice and fat, it will fall on the peppers, flavoring them while simultaneously preventing flare-ups.\nIf your grill does not have two levels, put the peppers on the hottest part of the grill and the sausages on the coolest.\nCover and grill everything for 15 to 20 minutes or so, periodically checking and turning the sausages and peppers as needed.\n5 Baste with honey balsamic mixture: Towards the end of cooking, baste the sausages, peppers and onions with the honey and balsamic mixture.\n6 Remove from grill, cut sausages, cut peppers and onions: When the sausages are cooked through and the peppers and onions cooked, remove them from the grill to a sheet pan or large bowl.\nIf you want, pick off some or all of the charred skin on the peppers. Cut the peppers into long strips, and slice the root end off the onions to separate the pieces.\nCut the sausages into thirds. Mix everything well in the pan or bowl.\n7 Serve: To serve, place a bed of baby arugula on the serving plates and top with the sausage, peppers and onion.\nHello!

It is typically a mix of paprika, cayenne, garlic, cumin, oregano, and a few other dried spices.\nBe sure to buy bell peppers that are shaped like big cups and can stand upright on their own.\nYou can also cook these peppers in the oven: Put them in a baking dish, cover with foil, and bake at 400F for 50 to 60 minutes. Slice one pepper open to make sure the beef has cooked through.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound (450g) lean ground beef\n1 1/2 (225g) cups cooked brown rice\n1 1/4 cups (150g) diced yellow onions\n1 1/4 (115g) cups shredded mozzarella cheese\n3/4 cup (80g) corn kernels (fresh or frozen)\n1 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n1 teaspoon sea salt\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n5 to 6 large bell peppers\nSpecial Equipment:\n4- to 6-quart slow cooker, though any size will work as long as the peppers will stand upright\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Mix the filling: In a large bowl, mix the ground beef, cooked rice, onions, 3/4 cup of the mozzarella cheese, corn, Cajun seasoning, oregano, sea salt and paprika together. The beef can be a bit difficult to break apart in the beginning. Using a fork can help. Set filling aside (or cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours).\n2 Prepare the peppers: Slice off the tops of the bell peppers. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to cut off a lot; just enough to get the stem off. Remove the seeds and membrane from the insides of the peppers. The peppers should look like little cups that are ready for stuffing.\n3 Stuff each pepper with beef and rice filling. Carefully place each stuffed pepper into the slow cooker. Cover the pot.\n(The stuffed peppers can also be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before cooking.)\n4 Set the slow cooker on low and cook for 4 to 5 hours. The peppers are done when the meat is cooked through. About 10 minutes before the peppers are done, sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of the peppers and close the lid.\n5 Drain excess liquid and serve: Carefully remove peppers from the slow cooker. Some of your peppers may have filled with some liquid. That\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly normal. I like to gently tip the peppers over to drain the excess liquid before serving. Be careful when doing this, as the peppers may still be quite hot.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Mash together with a fork.\nAdd in ripe avocados and mash until the guacamole comes together. Some chunks are good, but it should be creamy and dippable.\nGuacamole can be made a day in advance. To store it, place plastic wrap directly on the surface of the guacamole to slow oxidation and refrigerate.\n2 Make the taco filling: In a large skillet over medium-high heat, add the olive oil and SPAM strips. Cook until strips start to get crispy and browned, about 10 minutes, stirring occasionally.\nRemove strips from the skillet and add the pineapple and red peppers. Continue to cook until red peppers soften slightly and pineapple starts to turn tan in spots, another 6 to 8 minutes.\nAdd strips back to skillet and toss to combine. Keep warm until serving.\n3 Assemble the tacos: Warm tortillas by wrapping them in damp paper towels and microwaving them for 10 seconds. Then add a smear of sour cream (and/or guacamole) to each tortilla. Top with a handful of shredded cabbage, 2 to 3 strips of crispy SPAM, and seared pineapple and red pepper.

b"Save It Print\nStrawberry Shortcake Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 9\nI updated the biscuit recipe to use less cream. If you liked the original, use 1 1/2 cups of heavy whipping cream in place of the 1 cup of milk and 1/4 cup of cream.\nINGREDIENTS\nStrawberries:\n3 baskets of fresh strawberries (about 6 cups)\n1/2 cup (100 g) white granulated sugar for the strawberries\nWhipped Cream:\n1 cup (236 ml) of heavy whipping cream\n2 teaspoons powdered sugar\n2 drops of vanilla extract\nBiscuits:\n3 1/4 cups (455g) all purpose flour, divided ( 3 cups and 1/4 cup)\n3 tablespoons sugar\n1 1/2 tablespoons baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n12 tablespoons (168g) unsalted butter, cut into small cubes\n1 cup (236 ml) milk\n1/4 (60 ml) cup heavy cream\n1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nSTRAWBERRIES\n1 Prep the strawberries: Cut the stems away from the strawberries and discard. Cut the strawberries in half, and then either quarters or thick slices.\n2 Macerate the strawberries with sugar: Put the cut strawberries into a large bowl and sprinkle with sugar. Start with 1/4 cup of sugar and then add up to another 1/4 cup depending on how sweet your strawberries are. Gently stir the strawberries until they are all coated with some sugar.\nLet sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes, until the berries soften and begin to release their juices.\n3 Mash some of the strawberries: After 20 minutes or so, mash about a quarter of the berries in the bowl with a potato masher and stir to mix.\nYou don't want to mash all the berries, just enough of them for their juices. Let sit while you bake the biscuits.\n4 Bake the biscuits using one of the recipes below.\n5 Make whipped cream: While the biscuits are baking, whip the cream using an electric mixer, adding a drop or two of vanilla and 2 teaspoons of powdered sugar. Cover with plastic and place in the refrigerator to chill until ready to serve.\nTo serve, break up one biscuit per person into big pieces into a bowl. Ladle strawberries over the biscuit. Add a dollop of whipped cream.\nHOMEMADE BISCUITS\n1 Stir flour with dry ingredients: In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together 3 cups of the flour, the sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n2 Work in the butter: Cut the butter into the flour mixture, either using your fingers, a pastry cutter, a fork, or a food processor, until the largest pieces of butter are the size of peas.\n3 Add the wet ingredients: Stir together the milk and cream, add the vanilla extract. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour the milk mixture into it.\nMix with a fork or wooden spoon until the mixture is just combined. It should look rather shaggy. If it is too wet to work with, sprinkle some of the remaining 1/4 cup of flour over it. Gently knead by hand a few times to form a loose ball of dough, adding more flour if needed. It should be slightly tacky but not wet.\n4 Chill: Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and form it into an 8-inch square, about 3/4-inch to an inch thick. Place it on a parchment or silicone-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and chill for 20 minutes.\n5 Bake: Heat the oven to 425\xc2\xbaF. Remove the dough from refrigerator. Cut the dough into 9 even squares and space them about 2 inches apart from each other on the baking sheet.\nBake until the biscuits are medium golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.\nMakes 9 biscuits.\nBisquick biscuits:\nFor quick and easy shortcake biscuits using Bisquick baking mix, see our Bisquick shortcake biscuit recipe.\nGluten-free biscuits:\nFor flaky, fluffy, tender gluten-free biscuits, see our Gluten-free Biscuits Recipe.\nDairy-free vegan biscuits:\nFor easy, tender vegan shortcake biscuits, see our Dairy-free Vegan Biscuits recipe.\nHello!

Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F (200\xc2\xb0C). Grease a standard 12 muffin pan or line with paper muffin cups. (Actually, with the berries you'll have more batter than just for 12 muffins. This batch made 18 muffins.)\n2 Combine dry ingredients: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl.\n3 Combine wet ingredients and sugar: In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, sour cream, milk, sugar, butter and vanilla.\n4 Add wet ingredients to dry, then add berries: Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture, and mix together with a few light strokes, just until the dry ingredients are moistened.\nAdd the berries. (If you are using frozen berries, defrost them first, then drain the excess liquid, then coat them lightly in flour.)\nDo not over-mix! Over-mixing will cause the muffins to be dense, not fluffy. The batter should not be smooth, but rather lumpy.\n5 Put into muffin cups and bake: Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups. Bake at 400\xc2\xb0F (200\xc2\xb0C) until a toothpick inserted into the middle of 1 or 2 of the muffins comes out clean, 17-20 minutes (or longer).\n6: Let cool: Let cool for 2 to 3 minutes before removing from the pan. If not serving hot, let cool on a rack.\nServe as soon as possible, preferably within a few hours of baking.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Your cooking time may need to increase by a few minutes.\nSome brands of sour cream are much thicker than others. Feel free to dilute the sour cream with a little water if you think it's too thick. You can also substitute the sour cream with plain yogurt; if you do, you likely will not need both tablespoons of added milk.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, plus 1 tablespoon for dusting the blueberries\n1 tablespoon baking powder (make sure your baking powder is still good! click to see how)\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n8 tablespoons butter (1 stick), melted\n1 cup sugar\n2 large eggs\n1 1/2 cup plain sour cream\n2 tablespoons milk\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n1 1/2 cups blueberries, fresh or frozen (see Recipe Note)\nSpecial equipment:\nStandard 12-cup muffin tin\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven and prep the muffin tin: Preheat your oven to 400\xc2\xb0F with a rack in the lower middle. Using a standard 12-well muffin pan, place a muffin liner in each well, or if you don't have muffin liners, grease the inside of the muffin pan wells with vegetable oil or butter.\n2 Toss the berries with flour: Place the blueberries in a bowl. Sprinkle 1 tablespoon of flour over them and gently toss to coat. (The flour will help keep the blueberries from sinking in the muffin as it cooks.)\n3 Mix the dry ingredients: In a mixing bowl, whisk together the dry ingredients\xe2\x80\x94the flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt.\n4 Mix the wet ingredients separately: In a large mixing bowl, place the sour cream, sugar, eggs, milk, melted butter, lemon zest, and vanilla (the wet ingredients). Whisk together until smooth.\n5 Make the batter: Add the dry ingredients to the butter/sugar/egg mixture a third at a time and mix until just incorporated.  Do not over mix!\nGently fold the blueberries into the mixture.\n6  Portion out the muffins: Distribute the dough equally among the cups. You'll need to fill them very high to use all of the batter in 12 muffins, which is fine. They won't spill. If you still have too much dough, start filling another tin.\n7 Bake the muffins: Place the muffins in the oven and bake at 400\xc2\xb0F until the muffins are golden brown, about 20 minutes. (If the muffins are getting too brown, tent with foil.) Test with a bamboo skewer to make sure the centers of the muffins are done.\n8 Cool and serve: Let the muffins cool in the muffin pan for 2 to 3 minutes, then remove them from the pan.

Baking powder older than 6 months tends to go flat.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 3/4 cups (250 g) all purpose flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature\n1 cup (8 ounces, 230 g) ricotta cheese, left to stand at room temperature for a few minutes to take the chill off\n1 1/2 cups sugar (300 g)\n3 large eggs, room temperature\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon lemon zest\n1 1/2 cups (140 g) blueberries\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 325\xc2\xb0F (160\xc2\xb0C). Prepare a 9x5-inch loaf pan, smearing the inside with butter.\n2 Whisk the dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.\n2 Toss blueberries with flour: Rinse the blueberries and toss them with a little flour to lightly coat them (this will help keep them from sinking to the bottom of the cake).\n3 Mix wet ingredients and sugar for batter: Use an electric mixer (you can mix by hand but will get better results if you use an electric mixer) to beat together the butter, ricotta, and sugar, on high speed, for 3 minutes, until pale and fluffy.\nAdd the eggs one at a time, mixing on medium speed for one minute after each addition.\nMix in the lemon zest and vanilla extract. Don't worry if the batter looks a little curdled at this point. It isn't curdled; it just looks that way.\n4 Add dry ingredients, then blueberries: Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the dry ingredients in 3 or 4 additions, until just incorporated. Do not over mix. Stir in the blueberries.\n5 Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, smoothing out the top with a rubber spatula. Place on a baking sheet on the middle oven rack of the oven.

b'Save It Print\nLemon Blueberry Scones Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 18 minutesChilling time: 2 hoursYield: 16 scones\nTo make the scones without a food processor: Whisk the dry ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Use a pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture looks sandy with only small gravel-sized bits of butter remaining. Pour the whisked yogurt and egg mixture over top, and use a wooden spoon or dough whisk to mix the wet and dry ingredients. Fold in the blueberries.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the scones:\n2 1/3 cup (300g) unbleached all-purpose flour\n1/4 cup (56g) granulated sugar\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n8 tablespoons (1 stick, 4 ounces) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n3/4 cup (170g) whole milk Greek yogurt\n1 large egg\n1 (6 ounce) container fresh blueberries, picked over for stems, rinsed, and dried\nFor the glaze:\n1 tablespoon lemon zest, from 1 medium lemon\n2 tablespoons lemon juice, from 1 medium lemon\n1 cup (120g) powdered sugar\nSpecial equipment:\nFood processor\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the dough in a food processor: Measure the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a food processor. Process the ingredients to combine them evenly.\nSprinkle the cubed butter over the flour mixture, and process the mixture in 1-second pulses until the butter is no longer visible and the mixture looks somewhat sandy.\nIn another mixing bowl, whisk together the yogurt and egg until no streaks of egg yolk remain. Pour this mixture into the food processor with the flour and the butter.\nRun the food processor for about three seconds, just until all of the flour is absorbed and the dough begins to come away from the sides of the bowl.\n2 Fold in the blueberries: Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Scatter the blueberries over top and fold the dough a few times with a spatula to incorporate. (You can also do this in a separate mixing bowl instead of on the counter, if you prefer.)\n3 Shape the dough into disks and chill: With a bench scraper or knife, divide the dough in half and pat into two disks, about 1/2-inch thick and six inches across (you can use the length of your hand as a guide).\nWrap the disks of dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least two hours, or up to 24 hours.\n4 Preheat the oven to 350F: Line a baking sheet with a silicon baking mat or parchment paper.\n5 Cut and bake the scones: Unwrap the disks of chilled dough and cut each one into eight wedges (16 wedges total).\nPlace the wedges an inch apart on the lined baking sheet. Try not to touch the sides or handle the scones too much as you transfer them since this can inhibit how much they rise in the oven.\nBake the scones for 15 to 18 minutes, until they are lightly browned.\n6 Make the glaze: While the scones are baking, whisk together the lemon zest, lemon juice, and powdered sugar in a small bowl. The glaze should be a pourable consistency; add additional lemon juice (or milk, or water) 1 teaspoon at a time if needed.\n7 Glaze and cool the scones: Transfer the scones to a cooling rack with something underneath to catch any dripping glaze (I use wax paper). While the scones are still warm, drizzle each one with a teaspoon of the glaze. Let the scones cool until the glaze has fully set, about 30 minutes.\nHello!

Stir to coat blueberries with the sugar. Mash with a potato masher.\n2 Put the mashed blueberries into a blender and blend for a couple of minutes until smooth.\n3 Place a sieve over a large bowl and working in batches, press the mixture through the sieve, using a rubber spatula. This will catch the tougher and larger pieces of lemon and blueberry peel.\n4 Chill the mixture for at least an hour in the fridge. Then process following the directions of your ice cream maker.\nEat immediately (the sorbet will still be a little soft) or freeze at least a few hours to help firm up before eating. Eat soon after making though, as the sorbet will get progressively harder the longer it stays in the freezer.\nServe with a few fresh blueberries and a sprig of mint.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nAmerican Flag Pie Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hourCook time: 1 hour, 10 minutesDough chilling time: 1 hourYield: Serves 12\nIf you haven't worked with a sour cream pie dough before, it's wetter and more pliable than a standard butter crust dough. Don't worry, it will firm up when it chills.\nWhile this recipe calls for blueberries and strawberries, you can easily change it up a bit. Add raspberries, cherries, or rhubarb to the strawberries or use blackberries instead of or in addition to blueberries.\nAs you are rolling out the dough for the crust and stars and stripes, if it becomes too too soft to handle, just put it in the refrigerator for a few minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\nCrust:\n3 1/2 cups flour\n3 1/2 teaspoons sugar\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n14 ounces butter (3 1/2 sticks), cut into cubes\n7/8 cup sour cream (that's 3/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp)\nStrawberry filling:\n3 1/2 pounds strawberries, hulled, quartered\n1/2 cup sugar\n2 teaspoons orange zest\n4 Tbsp cornstarch, flour, or minute tapioca\nBlueberry filling:\n1 pint blueberries (about 0.6 lbs, 280 g)\n3 Tbsp sugar\n1/4 teaspoon cinnamon\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n2 teaspoons lemon juice\n2 Tbsp cornstarch, flour, or minute tapioca\nEgg wash:\n1 egg white\n1 teaspoon of milk or cream\nSpecial equipment:\nOne 13 x 18-inch rimmed sheet pan\nStar-shaped cookie cutter\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the pie dough: Cut the butter into cubes and let sit out for a 10 minutes to take the chill off. Whisk together the flour, sugar, and salt in a large mixing bowl.\nAdd the butter and toss to coat with the flour. Using your (clean) hands, work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.\nAdd the sour cream and mix with a fork until well incorporated.\nKnead with your hands until the mixture comes together as a ball. Divide into 3 equal sized balls of dough (it helps to use a kitchen scale).\nForm the balls into rectangular discs. Sprinkle with a little flour and wrap individually with plastic wrap.\nChill for 1 to 2 hours or overnight (can freeze this point if making several days ahead).\n2 Make berry fillings: Put the quartered strawberries in a large bowl and toss with sugar, cornstarch (or flour, or minute tapioca), and orange zest.\nIn a separate smaller bowl, put the blueberries, sugar, cinnamon, lemon zest, lemon juice, and cornstarch (or flour or minute tapioca), and toss to combine.\n3 Roll out the dough for the bottom crust: Line the bottom of a 13 x 18-inch rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper.\nRemove two dough discs from the refrigerator and let sit for 10 minutes to soften a bit. On a clean, lightly floured surface, roll out one disk to 11 x 17-inches and arrange on half of the sheet pan, with an inch of edge over the sides of the sheet pan.\nRoll out the second disc and cover the other half of the sheet pan.\nFold the dough over along the edges and crimp.\nRemove any excess dough from center. Form into a ball, then use your hands to roll into a long rope. Crimp that rope of dough and form a rectangle in one corner of the sheet pan. This is where your berries and stars will go. The dough will help keep the blueberries from running into the strawberries. (If you don't have excess dough at this point, no worries, you will later when you cut away the stars and stripes.)\nPut in the refrigerator to chill.\n4 Make egg wash: In a small bowl, whisk together the egg white and milk or cream.\n5 Roll out dough for stars and stripes: Remove third rectangular disc of dough from the fridge and let sit for 10 minutes to soften a bit. Roll out so that the longest point is 18-inches.\nUse a dinner knife (blunt) or a pizza wheel to cut out stripes. You'll need 2 stripes that are about 18 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide, and 2 stripes that are about 10 inches long and 1 1/2 inches wide.\nUse a star shaped cookie cutter to cut out stars.\nPlace stars and stripes on a cookie sheet, sheet pan, or large plate. Brush with egg wash. Chill.\n6 Preheat oven to 450\xc2\xb0F.\n7 Fill the pie and top with stars and stripes: Spread the strawberries over the part of the sheet pan where the red and white stripes should be. Scoop the blueberries into the corner where the stars should be.\nArrange the stars and strips of dough on top of the berries to form the flag. Chill for 10-15 minutes before baking.\n8 Bake: Bake at 450\xc2\xb0F for 15 minutes. Then tent with foil and lower the heat to 375\xc2\xb0F and bake for another 45 to 55 minutes or longer, until the filling is bubbling.\nRemove from oven and let cool at least an hour before serving.\nHello!

b"Print\nPanna Cotta with Summer Berries Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesChilling time: 4 hours or overnightYield: 6 servings\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the panna cotta:\nVegetable oil, or vegetable oil spray (for the molds)\n1/2 cup cold milk\n3 teaspoons unflavored gelatin powder\n3 cups heavy cream\n1/3 cup (67g) sugar\nPinch of salt\n1/2 cup sour cream\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\nFor the sauce and berries:\n1 12-ounce package (about 3 cups) frozen raspberries, defrosted\n3 tablespoons sugar\n3 tablespoons orange juice\n2 cups fresh blueberries, raspberries, blackberries, sliced strawberries, or a mix\nSpecial equipment:\n6 (6-ounce) ramekins, or other similarly sized molds or serving dishes\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the molds: Lightly brush or spray six 6-ounce ramekins with oil. (Skip this step if you are planning to serve straight from the dishes.)\nPlace the ramekins on a baking sheet for easy transfer of the panna cotta from the counter to the fridge.\n2 Soften the gelatin: Pour the milk into a medium mixing bowl and sprinkle the gelatin over top. Stir with a fork to combine. Set aside for 5 minutes without stirring to allow the gelatin to soften. (It will look like curdled milk or milky applesauce.)\n3 Warm the cream and sugar: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream, sugar, and salt to a simmer. Stir frequently until the sugar is dissolved and the milk is just starting to steam. Do not let it come to a boil (if it does, let it cool slightly before continuing to the next step).\n4 Whisk the cream into the gelatin: Slowly pour the hot cream over the gelatin, whisking as you go in order to dissolve the gelatin. Rub a little of the cream mixture between your fingers to make sure the gelatin has dissolved; it should feel smooth, not grainy.\n5 Whisk in the sour cream and vanilla until smooth.\n6 Fill and chill the molds: Divide the panna cotta mixture between the ramekins. Transfer to the ramekins to the fridge and chill for at least 4 hours until set, or overnight.\n7 Make the raspberry sauce: Close to when you're ready to serve, puree the raspberries, sugar and orange juice in a blender until smooth. Pass through a fine meshed strainer to remove the seeds. Set aside or refrigerate until needed. (This sauce can also be made several days in advance and kept refrigerated.)\n8 Unmold the panna cotta: Slide a paring knife around the edge of each ramekin. Place a dessert plate upside-down over the top of the ramekin. Holding the plate in position, flip it over so the ramekin is now upside down on top of the plate. Slowly lift the ramekin at a slight angle to release the panna cotta.\nSpoon some of the sauce around the panna cotta and sprinkle with berries. (If you're serving straight from the dish, spoon some of the sauce over top and sprinkle with berries.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Work the butter with your fingers to smear it and crumble it into the flour, until the mixture resembles a coarse cornmeal.\nTip: at this point, if you briefly heat the apricot berry mixture in the microwave or oven, until it is warm, it will help the biscuit topping to rise.\n3 Add almond extract and buttermilk: Add almond extract to the buttermilk, then form a well in the middle of the flour mixture and pour in the buttermilk.\nGently mix (with wooden spoon or your hands) until the dough just comes together. Do not over-mix.\n4 Form "cobblestone" shapes of the dough and arrange on the top of the apricot berry mixture. (You can also just crumble the dough over the top.) Sprinkle brown sugar over the top of the dough. Drizzle melted butter over the top (aim for the fruit more than the biscuits).\n5 Preheat oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. Let the cobbler sit and rise for 10-20 minutes before baking.\n6 Bake: Bake at 425\xc2\xb0F for 10-15 minutes or until the top is just beginning to brown, then reduce the heat to 350\xc2\xb0F.

b'Print\nShrimp with Orange Beurre Blanc Recipe\nINGREDIENTS\nShrimp Ingredients\nFresh Gulf of Mexico shrimp - 6 per person, or about 1/4 pound per person\nExtra virgin olive oil\nSalt and pepper\nSauce ingredients (Sauce also posted here. Makes 1 cup, enough for 4-6 servings. Divide or multiply to needs.)\n2 oranges\n1/2 cup (120 ml) white wine\n2 teaspoons minced shallots\n1/2 pound (2 sticks, 225 g) cold, unsalted butter\nSalt and white pepper\nMETHOD\n1 Peel and de-vein the shrimp. Work with the shrimp one at a time, leaving the rest in a bowl of ice water. Holding on to the body of the shrimp, use your fingers to pull off head if it is still attached, and then the legs.\nStarting with the head end, gently peel back the shell. Use your fingernails or a knife to cut into the base shell segment.\nRemove the shrimp from its shell entirely. Place shrimp down flat on a cutting board and use a small sharp knife to make a shallow cut down the back of the shrimp.\nYou may see a dark, vein-like intestinal tract running through the meat. Use your fingers, or the sharp tip of a knife to remove. As you complete each shrimp, put into a bowl of ice water to keep cool. Set aside while you prepare the sauce.\n2 Make orange syrup: Zest half of one orange (about 2 teaspoons) and juice the two oranges (about 3/4 cup). Put the juice, zest, wine and shallots in a sauce pan on medium high heat. Cook until it is syrupy and almost gone.\n3 Whisk in the butter: On low heat, whisk in the butter continuously and vigorously, 1 tablespoon at a time. Butter is the only emulsifier for this sauce, and if you slowly add it, continuously stirring, the sauce will achieve a silky smooth texture. Do not let the sauce boil. Salt and pepper to taste. Keep warm while you continue with the shrimp.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 the shrimp: Heat a skillet on medium high heat. Drain the shrimp and coat with olive oil. When the pan is hot, add the shrimp and sprinkle on some salt and pepper.\nCook the shrimp about 45 seconds on each side. Add some more olive oil if necessary to keep the shrimp from sticking to the pan. Do not overcook or the shrimp will be tough and rubbery.\n5 Drizzle with sauce: Drizzle Beurre Blanc sauce over shrimp, or serve in a separate small container for dipping.\nHello!

b'Print\nBiscuits and Gravy Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesCook time: 35 minutesYield: 12 servings\nThe cornstarch in the biscuit dough reduces the gluten content to help keep the biscuits light and fluffy.\nIf you have White Lily Flour, use 2 1/2 cups of White Lily flour instead of all-purpose, and omit the cornstarch.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the biscuits:\n2 1/4 cups (315 g) all-purpose flour (see Recipe Note)\n3 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold\n1 cup buttermilk, cold\nFor the gravy:\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1/2 pound sliced mushrooms\n1/4 cup chopped yellow onions\n1 pound breakfast pork sausage\n6 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon ground sage\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n2 1/2 cups milk, preferably whole\nFor topping:\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted\nSpecial equipment:\n2-quart glass or ceramic baking dish, rectangular or square\n2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Make the biscuit dough: Combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch chunks and sprinkle it over the dry ingredients. Using a pastry blender, a butter knife, or a fork, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until most of it is the size of peas. Don\xe2\x80\x99t overwork it; you want to leave some of the butter in chunks.\nAdd the buttermilk and toss the mixture with a spatula until it starts to look shaggy, and most of the buttermilk has been absorbed. It won\xe2\x80\x99t form a dough yet; that\xe2\x80\x99s OK.\n3 Bring the dough together: Turn out the contents of the bowl onto a clean surface dusted with a little flour. Gather the dough together with your hands into a mound, then roll it out until it is about 10-inches wide. Again, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry if the dough is crumbly!\n4 Fold the dough to create flaky layers: Use a spatula (like the kind you use to make fried eggs) or bench scraper and flip 1/3 of the dough over from the left to the center. Then flip the other side over that side. You\xe2\x80\x99re basically folding the dough over like a letter.\nRotate the dough 90-degrees and roll it out again to about a 10-inch square. It will start to feel more like a dough and less crumbly at this point, but there will still be some loose chunks. Just press them back into the dough if they fall out, and resist the urge to add more liquid.\nRepeat the process of rolling out and folding two more times. By the fourth time, the biscuit dough will hold together and feel like actual dough.\n5 Cut the biscuits: Roll out the dough to a 10-inch square that\xe2\x80\x99s roughly 1/2 inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, cut out 16 circles. When you press down to cut out the dough, don\xe2\x80\x99t twist the biscuit cutter, which will \xe2\x80\x9cseal\xe2\x80\x9d the edges of the dough. Instead, just cut straight down, so the biscuit will rise and be as flaky as possible.\n5 Bake the bottom layer of biscuits: Set aside 12 of the biscuit rounds. Place the remaining 4 biscuit rounds on the bottom of a 2-quart glass or ceramic casserole dish. Cut up the remaining scraps of dough and jigsaw-puzzle the remaining dough into the bottom of the casserole dish, making sure to cover the bottom in a single layer.\nPlace on a rimmed baking sheet (for ease of removal from the oven and to catch any drips). Bake in the oven for 15 minutes or until the top of the biscuits start to look dry but not brown at all. (There might be a slight darkening around the edges, but don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed if the biscuits still look pale white.)\n6 Meanwhile, make the gravy: While the bottom biscuits are baking, make the gravy by placing the oil, mushrooms, and onions in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan. Cook on high heat, stirring constantly, until the mushrooms start to soften, and the onions start to look translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or spatula, and cook until the sausage starts to brown, about 5 minutes.\nKeep the heat on high, and add the flour, sage, black pepper, nutmeg, and salt to the pan. Stir until the ingredients are absorbed. Pour in the milk, reduce heat to medium, and cook, continuing to stir until the liquid has started to bubble and thicken, about 3 to 7 minutes. You\xe2\x80\x99re now ready to assemble the casserole!\nIf the first layer of biscuits isn\xe2\x80\x99t done baking, lower the heat on the gravy to a simmer until the biscuits are done. If you still need time to finish the gravy, but the biscuits are done\xe2\x80\x94remove the casserole dish from the oven, and let it sit on the counter or stovetop while you finish the gravy.\n7 Assemble and bake the casserole: Once the gravy has thickened and the first layer of biscuits is done baking, pour or spoon the gravy over the biscuit layer in the casserole dish. Place the 12 reserved biscuits over the gravy and brush the top of the biscuits with the melted butter.\nReturn the dish to the oven and bake until the biscuits are golden brown and the gravy is bubbling and thick, about 18 to 23 minutes.\n8 Cool and serve: Let cool 10 minutes before serving warm from the casserole dish.\nHello!

Start with 1/4 cup of sugar and then add up to another 1/4 cup depending on how sweet your strawberries are. Gently stir the strawberries until they are all coated with some sugar.\nLet sit at room temperature for about 20 minutes, until the berries soften and begin to release their juices.\n3 Mash some of the strawberries: After 20 minutes or so, mash about a quarter of the berries in the bowl with a potato masher and stir to mix.\nYou don't want to mash all the berries, just enough of them for their juices. Let sit while you bake the biscuits.\n4 Bake the biscuits using one of the recipes below.\n5 Make whipped cream: While the biscuits are baking, whip the cream using an electric mixer, adding a drop or two of vanilla and 2 teaspoons of powdered sugar. Cover with plastic and place in the refrigerator to chill until ready to serve.\nTo serve, break up one biscuit per person into big pieces into a bowl. Ladle strawberries over the biscuit. Add a dollop of whipped cream.\nHOMEMADE BISCUITS\n1 Stir flour with dry ingredients: In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together 3 cups of the flour, the sugar, baking powder, and salt.\n2 Work in the butter: Cut the butter into the flour mixture, either using your fingers, a pastry cutter, a fork, or a food processor, until the largest pieces of butter are the size of peas.\n3 Add the wet ingredients: Stir together the milk and cream, add the vanilla extract. Make a well in the center of the flour and pour the milk mixture into it.\nMix with a fork or wooden spoon until the mixture is just combined. It should look rather shaggy. If it is too wet to work with, sprinkle some of the remaining 1/4 cup of flour over it. Gently knead by hand a few times to form a loose ball of dough, adding more flour if needed. It should be slightly tacky but not wet.\n4 Chill: Place the dough on a lightly floured surface and form it into an 8-inch square, about 3/4-inch to an inch thick. Place it on a parchment or silicone-lined baking sheet, cover with plastic wrap and chill for 20 minutes.\n5 Bake: Heat the oven to 425\xc2\xbaF. Remove the dough from refrigerator. Cut the dough into 9 even squares and space them about 2 inches apart from each other on the baking sheet.\nBake until the biscuits are medium golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes.\nMakes 9 biscuits.\nBisquick biscuits:\nFor quick and easy shortcake biscuits using Bisquick baking mix, see our Bisquick shortcake biscuit recipe.\nGluten-free biscuits:\nFor flaky, fluffy, tender gluten-free biscuits, see our Gluten-free Biscuits Recipe.\nDairy-free vegan biscuits:\nFor easy, tender vegan shortcake biscuits, see our Dairy-free Vegan Biscuits recipe.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHow to Make Gluten-Free Biscuits Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 20 minutesChilling time: 30 minutesYield: 10 (2 1/2-inch) biscuits\nYou can also bring this dough together in the food processor (with gentle pulses) and by hand (soak your hands in cold water; the butter should be even colder), but we have found that using the stand mixer works quickly and requires the least amount of manual interference with cold butter. And this is what you want for flaky biscuits!\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups (about 300 g) gluten-free flour mix, preferably Bob\xe2\x80\x99s Red Mill 1-to-1 Gluten-Free Baking Blend or another flour blend with xanthan gum\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon baking soda\n2 tablespoons sugar\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) very cold butter, cut into tablespoons and then cut in half, plus more to grease the pan\n3/4 to 1 cup cup cold buttermilk\n1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter\nSpecial equipment:\n9-inch cast iron skillet, or 8x8 baking dish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Combine dry ingredients: Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. \n2 Add the butter: On the low speed, let the mixer break up the butter into smaller pieces; this should take about a minute. Stop the mixer and check; you still want visible pieces of butter about the size of marbles or even a little bigger. They will look like they are starting to flatten.\nThis dough is not a situation where we say the flour and butter should look like \xe2\x80\x9cthe consistency of small peas.\xe2\x80\x9d If some of the pieces haven't flattened, just press them between your fingertips to break them up a little bit\xe2\x80\x94dime-sized pieces are fine.\n3 Add the buttermilk: Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and add 2 tablespoons of buttermilk. Using a fork, quickly mix the buttermilk into the flour to hydrate it.\nThen, slowly mix in a scant 3/4 cup of buttermilk and combine with a fork until no streaks of flour remain. If the dough seems dry, add additional buttermilk a tablespoon at a time and incorporate before adding more. You don't want a wet dough.\n4 Gather the dough into a ball: On a floured surface, turn out the dough, which will look like a crumbly mess. It will come together when you begin to shape it into a ball. If for some reason (ambient humidity, variations in buttermilk thickness) the dough feels dry, add a couple of tablespoons of buttermilk to hydrate those dry bits.\n5 Fold the dough like a letter: Lightly press the dough (or roll it with a floured rolling pin) into a thick rectangular shape, about 4 inches by 6 inches. Fold one of the short ends of the dough toward the middle, and then the other, like a letter.\nRotate the dough 1/4 turn and roll it out, and fold it again into thirds. Repeat this process one more time, then wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1/2 hour to an hour. (This process creates flaky layers; if you skip it, your biscuits will bake flat, like hockey pucks.) \n6 Prep the oven and pan: Preheat the oven to 425\xc2\xb0F and prep a 9- or 10-inch cast iron pan or an 8x8 glass baking dish with either spray oil or grease with butter.\n7 Roll and cut out the biscuits: Remove the dough from the fridge and, using a rolling pin, gently roll it out to a rectangle about 6 inches by 9 inches and one inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter that\xe2\x80\x99s been lightly floured (this dough can be sticky), cut out about 6 biscuits by pressing the cutter straight down into the dough; if you twist them when you remove them, you\xe2\x80\x99ll stunt their rise!\nReroll the scraps, reflouring the biscuit cutter if needed, and make more biscuits until all the dough is used up.\nTransfer to the pan. You will have to nestle them close to each other, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. You want them touching in order for them to rise better. Brush the tops with the melted butter.\n8 Bake: Bake the biscuits for 20 to 25 minutes until the tops look lightly brown around the edges. Check frequently to avoid burning.\n9 Cool and serve: Remove from the oven and brush the tops with melted butter. Let the biscuits cool in the pan for about 5 to 10 minutes before removing from the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Try to wait the seemingly impossible 10 minutes before you eat one. They will continue to cook a little, firm up a little while cooling, and not burn your mouth. It\xe2\x80\x99s all worth the wait.\nThese biscuits are best eaten warm out of the oven, but they do okay reheated in a toaster or low oven (300\xc2\xb0F) for up to 2 days. They get dried out pretty fast.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"
b"Save It Print\nBiscuits and Gravy Recipe\nCook time: 35 minutesYield: Makes 10 to 12 servings\nI recommend preparing the biscuits first (not baking them), getting the gravy started, and then baking the biscuits while the gravy is thickening up. That way you can stir the gravy frequently which is hard to do when your hands are covered with flour and dough.\nIf you don't have self-rising flour, you can substitute using a ratio of 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, plus 1/8 teaspoon of salt, for every cup of self-rising flour.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the Buttermilk Biscuits:\n2 1/2 cups self-rising flour (plus extra for flouring your surface)\n2 tsp sugar (optional)\n1/2 tsp kosher salt\n4 Tbsp vegetable shortening (see Baking Tips below)\n4 Tbsp butter, cut into cubes, chilled\n1 cup chilled buttermilk, plus 1-2 Tbsp more, if needed\n1 Tbsp melted butter (optional, to brush on top of biscuits after baking)\nFor the Sausage Gravy:\n1 lb sage-flavored pork sausage\n1/4 cup finely chopped white or yellow onion\n6 tbsp all purpose flour\n4 cups whole milk\n1/2 tsp poultry seasoning\n1/4 tsp ground nutmeg\n1/4 tsp salt\n1-2 dashes of Worcestershire sauce\n1-2 dashes of Tabasco sauce, cayenne pepper, or other hot sauce\n1-2 Tbsp butter or bacon grease (if needed)\nMETHOD\nTO MAKE THE BUTTERMILK BISCUITS:\nBaking Tips: 1) Spoon the flour into your measuring cup, and level it off with the back side of a knife. If you scoop the flour, it will pack into the measuring cup, yielding too much flour, 2) Instead of 4 Tbsp each of butter and shortening, feel free to use 8 Tbsp of shortening or butter, or any combination up to 8 Tbsp.\n1 Preheat oven to 450\xc2\xb0F. Prepare a floured surface for shaping the dough and have an un-greased baking sheet ready (lined with Silpat sheets if you have them).\n2 Whisk together flour, sugar and salt in a medium-sized bowl.\n3 Using a fork or a pastry blender cut in the shortening and butter. Work quickly, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the fats to melt \xe2\x80\x93 the key to fluffy biscuits is minimal handling. The mixture should be crumbly.\n4 Make a well in the flour mixture, and pour in the buttermilk. Stir with a spoon and blend just until the liquid is absorbed and the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl \xe2\x80\x93 add 1-2 tbsp more buttermilk if the dough is dry. Do not over mix; the dough will be tacky, neither wet nor dry.\n5 Fold and shape dough: With lightly floured hands, turn out the dough onto a lightly-floured surface and gently fold it over on itself 2 or 3 times. Shape into a 3/4\xe2\x80\x9d thick round. If you use a rolling pin, be sure to flour it first to keep the dough from sticking to the pin.\n6 Cut out biscuits: Using a 2-inch biscuit cutter, cut out the biscuits pressing straight down (avoid the temptation to twist the cutter as twisting keeps the biscuits from rising). Dip the cutter in flour between cuttings to keep the dough from sticking to the cutter.\nPlace biscuits on the baking sheet so that they just touch (for crunchy sides, leave space in between). Reshape scrap dough and continue cutting. Remember to handle the dough as little as possible.\n(At this point you can start on making the sausage gravy below, and put the biscuits in the oven right before adding the milk in the last gravy step.)\n7 Bake: Bake at 450\xc2\xb0F for 15-18 minutes or until lightly golden brown on top. Turn the baking sheet around halfway through baking.\n8 Brush with butter: (Optional) Brush the tops of the biscuits with melted butter.\nTO MAKE THE SAUSAGE GRAVY:\n1 Brown the sausage, stir in onions: Preheat a 4-quart saucepan over medium high heat (put a few drops of water in the pan \xe2\x80\x93 when they evaporate, you know the pan is ready). Crumble the sausage into the pan and let it brown for a minute or two, then turn down to medium heat.\nContinue cooking, breaking up the sausage into smaller pieces, until no pink remains. Stir in the onions and cook until they are transparent.\n2 Adjust fat, add flour, brown the flour: Remove sausage with a slotted spatula or spoon, leaving the drippings in the pan. If less than 3 tbsp of drippings remain, add enough butter (or bacon grease) to equal about 3 tbsp of drippings.\nAdd the cooked sausage back to the pan on medium heat, and sprinkle the flour over the sausage.\nStir in the flour and cook for about 6-8 minutes, until the mixture starts bubbling and turns slightly golden brown.\n3 Add seasonings: Stir in poultry seasoning, nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and salt \xe2\x80\x93 cook for 1 minute to deepen the flavors.\n4 Add the milk, and cook until thickened: Slowly add the milk and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened (about 15 minutes). Be patient, it will thicken!\nTO SERVE THE BISCUITS AND GRAVY:\nTo serve, break a biscuit in half and put it in a bowl or on a plate. Spoon a generous portion of sausage gravy over the biscuit half and top with the other biscuit half.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

If too mild, include the seeds, if hot, use just the flesh, not the seeds. Adjust the amount to taste. Pepper Jack or Monterey Jack cheese can also be substituted for the cheddar.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 1/3 cups (175g) all-purpose flour\n1/4 cup (45g) polenta or fine milled corn meal\n3 tablespoons (45g) sugar\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nPinch cayenne pepper\n6 ounces (1 1/2 cups packed, 170g) shredded sharp cheddar cheese, divided (1 1/4 cup and 1/4 cup)\n2 tablespoons diced fresh jalape\xc3\xb1os (more or less to taste)\n3/4 cup + 2 tablespoons heavy cream (200ml), plus extra for brushing\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 425\xc2\xb0F (220\xc2\xb0C).\n2 Whisk dry ingredients, add cheese and jalape\xc3\xb1os: In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, polenta, salt, sugar, cayenne, and baking powder.\nStir in 1 1/4 cups of the grated cheddar cheese and the diced jalape\xc3\xb1os.\n3 Add the cream: Make a well in the center of the flour mixture. Pour the cream into the center of the well and your (clean) hands to gently bring together the ingredients.\nIf you need to add a bit more cream then do so a tiny trickle at a time. You just want everything to get wet enough so that the dough will be sticky and clumpy.\n4 Knead the dough, just enough: Turn the dough out onto a surface lightly dusted with flour. Knead the dough just a few times - maybe only three or four pushes. You just want it to just come together. (Over-kneading will result in firmer, denser biscuits.)\n5 Cut out biscuit shapes: Form the dough into a disc about 3/4-inch to an inch thick. Use a biscuit cutter (or a small juice glass) to cut round biscuit shapes out of the disk. Combine the leftover dough and keep forming small round biscuit shapes until the dough is used up.\n6 Brush with cream, sprinkle with cheese: Place on a silicone-lined or parchment lined baking sheet, with at least an inch or two between the biscuits. Brush the tops of the biscuits with a little more cream. Top the biscuits with a sprinkle of the remaining cheese.\n7 Bake: Bake at 425\xc2\xb0F (220\xc2\xb0C) for 11-12 minutes or until golden and the cheese is nicely melted.\nHello!

You could just do plain biscuits, or add in a teaspoon of orange zest, lemon zest, or a couple tablespoons of chopped candied ginger, or a teaspoon of minced rosemary. Have fun with it!\n**You can substitute the 1 1/4 cups buttermilk with 1 cup 3 Tbsp of regular whole milk mixed with 1 Tbsp of white vinegar.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven, prepare muffin pan: Preheat oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. Butter a standard muffin pan.\n2 Combine dry ingredients: In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt.\n3 Cut butter into flour, add mix-ins: Cut the butter into tablespoon sized pieces into the bowl of flour. Using your (clean) fingers, work the butter into the flour, schmooshing (technical term) the butter between your fingers and mixing with the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.\nIf you are using raisins, caraway seeds, or any other add-ins, mix them into the mixture now.\n4 Add buttermilk and form dough: Make a well in the center of the flour. Pour the buttermilk into the center of the well. Use a wooden spoon to gently mix the flour into the buttermilk until the flour is moistened with the buttermilk.\nThen use your hands to form the mixture into a loose, shaggy, slightly sticky ball of dough.\nThe dough should be a little sticky, if it's too dry, add a tablespoon more of buttermilk. If it's just too wet to handle, add a sprinkling more of flour. Do not over-mix!\nAnd at this point work quickly. As soon as the acidic buttermilk interacts with the alkaline baking soda, bubbles will form and leavening will start.\n5 Divide dough among wells of muffin tin: Break off 12-equal portions of the dough and place them in the wells of the muffin tin.\n6 Bake: Put in the oven and bake for 12-13 minutes at 425\xc2\xb0F, until the tops are nicely browned. Remove from the oven and let cool for a couple minutes in the pan. Remove the biscuits from the muffin tin to a rack to cool for a few minutes more.\nServe with butter and jam.\nHello!

Turn off the heat and let it cool.\n2 Mix onions, sage, salt, pepper into ground bison meat: When the onions are cool enough to touch, use your (clean) hands to gently mix them in with the bison burger meat, and add everything else.\nDo not overwork the meat, it will result in a tough burger. Just gently fold it until the onions, sage, salt and pepper are well mixed in.\n3 Form patties: Form patties with the meat, using about 1/4 to 1/3 of a pound of meat per patty.\nHere's a tip on making the patty: if you press a slight indentation in the center of each patty it will help keep the burgers in a nice disk shape when cooking. Otherwise the burger will start to get a little egg-shaped as the edges contract from cooking.\n4 Grill or fry the burgers: Grill or fry the burgers on medium heat, about 6-7 minutes per side, less or more depending on the thickness of the burger and the heat of the pan/grill, or until the internal temperature is 140\xc2\xb0F for medium rare, or 160\xc2\xb0F for well done.\nA note on internal temperature. If you are getting the ground meat from a source you trust (we got ours from Whole Foods) that does their own grinding on site, or you grind your own meat, you can safely cook the burgers rare or medium rare. Otherwise you'll want to cook the burgers until well done.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t press on your burgers while cooking, and keep the flipping to a minimum.\nLet the burgers rest about 5 minutes before serving.\nServe the burger with lettuce and tomato, topped with a smoky barbecue sauce.\nHello!

Don't crush or cut too small. You can even skip this step if you want, if you are already dealing with broken up shell pieces (like cracked crab).\n2 Roast shells (optional): Place in a large roasting pan and roast at 400\xc2\xb0F for 10 minutes (this step you can skip, but it greatly enhances the flavor).\n3 Cover shells with water and heat to not quite a simmer: Put the shells in a large stock pot and add enough water to cover the shells with an inch of water. Heat the water on high. As soon as you see that little bubbles are starting to come up to the surface, reduce the heat to medium.\nDo not let the water boil! You want to maintain the temperature at just at the edge of a simmer (around 180\xc2\xb0F), where the bubbles just occasionally come up to the surface.\nDo not stir the shells! Stirring will muddy up the stock.\nSkim the foam. As the bubbles come up to the surface a film of foam will develop on the surface. Use a large metal spoon to skim away this foam. Let the shells cook like this for about an hour; skim the foam every few minutes. The foam comes from shells releasing impurities as their temperature increases.\n4 Add the wine, onions, carrots, celery, tomato paste, herbs, peppercorns: Once the stock has stopped releasing foam, add the wine, onions, carrots, celery, tomato paste, thyme, parsley, bay leaf, and peppercorns.\nBring to a low simmer and reduce heat so that the stock continues to barely simmer, but not boil, for 30 minutes. If more foam comes to the surface, skim it off. Add salt and remove from heat.\n5 Strain through a lined sieve: Use tongs, a large slotted spoon, or a spider strainer to lift out and remove most of the solids from the stock. (Later put in a plastic bag and put outside in the trash! Shellfish shells have a way of stinking up a kitchen.)\nDampen a few layers of cheesecloth and place over a large, fine mesh strainer, over a large pot or bowl.\nPour the stock into the strainer. Either use the stock right away, or cool for future use.\nIf you aren't going to use in a couple of days, freeze (remember to leave some headroom at the top of your freezer container for the liquid to expand as it freezes.)\nHello!

Remove the bacon from the pot with a slotted spoon. Set aside on a paper towel to use for garnish later.\n2 Cook the onions, celery, carrot: Increase the heat to medium high and add the onions, celery and carrot. Cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring often, until the onions are translucent. Do not brown. Sprinkle some salt over everything as it cooks.\n3 Add the fish, tomatoes and the garlic and cook for another 2-3 minutes, stirring often.\n4 Add the orange zest, cayenne and saffron, then add the shellfish stock or whatever stock you are using. In a pinch you could even use chicken or vegetable stock, but the flavor of the soup will be different. Simmer this gently \xe2\x80\x93 do not let it get to a rolling boil \xe2\x80\x93 for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n5 Pur\xc3\xa9e the soup: Get another pot ready. Fill a blender a third of the way with the soup and blend it on high (starting on low then increasing to high) for 1 minute, or until it is well pur\xc3\xa9ed. Work in batches to pur\xc3\xa9e the rest of the soup. Pour the pur\xc3\xa9ed soup into the clean pot.\n6 Add cream: Put the soup on medium-low heat and add the cream. Stir well and taste for salt, adding if needed. Do not let this boil! Or it might break.\nServe garnished with bacon bits or dill fronds, and alongside some crusty bread. A dry rose or light red wine would go well with this; I\xe2\x80\x99d suggest a Beaujolais or a Pinot Noir.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nHow To Make Fast, No-Soak Beans in the Instant Pot\nCook time: 30 minutesYield: about 5 cups cooked beans\nDon\'t skip the olive oil. This helps reduce foam during cooking, which could clog the pressure valve on the pressure cooker.\nIf cooking red kidney beans, I recommend boiling the beans for about 10 minutes first to break down the lectins.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound dried beans (see below for cooking times for specific beans)\n8 cups water\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 to 2 teaspoons salt\n2 o 3 cloves peeled garlic, optional\n1 bay leaf, optional\nSpecial equipment:\n6- to 8-quart pressure cooker (I use a 6-quart Instant Pot)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Combine all ingredients in the pressure cooker. Do not fill the pressure cooker more than half full.\n2 Secure the lid. Make sure the pressure regulator valve is closed. (On an Instant Pot, this means it will be set to the the "sealing" position.)\n3 Cook the beans: Here are the cooking times for unsoaked beans in the Instant Pot. Cooking times will be similar for other electric pressure cookers; cooking time will be slightly less for stovetop pressure cookers. Double-check the manual that came with your pressure cooker for more exact cooking times:\nBlack beans: 20 to 25 minutes\nBlack-eyed peas : 20 to 25 minutes\nGreat Northern beans: 25 to 30 minutes\nNavy beans: 25 to 30 minutes\nPinto beans: 25 to 30 minutes\nCannellini beans: 35 to 40 minutes\nChickpeas (garbanzo beans): 35 to 40 minutes\nRed kidney beans: 25-30 minutes (boil for 10 minutes before pressure cooking)\nCook beans at high pressure for the time recommended above. The pressure cooker will take 15 to 20 minutes to come to full pressure before cooking begins.\n4 Let the pressure release: Once cooking is complete, you can let the pressure release naturally on its own, which takes about 20 to 30 minutes, or you can do a "quick release" by opening the pressure valve on the top of the pressure cooker. If doing a rapid release, be careful because the bean liquid sometimes foams into the valve.\nI recommend letting the pressure release naturally for as long as you\'re able before the beans are needed. This helps the beans retain their shape and avoids the bean liquid foaming.\nWhat to do if your beans aren\'t quite done: Put the lid back on the pressure cooker and make sure the release valve is set back to "sealing." Cook at high pressure for another 5 to 10 minutes (depending on if you think your beans need just a little more time or a little more time to finish). The pot will quickly come back up to pressure because the contents are already hot. Check your beans after the extra cooking time and continue cooking for longer if needed.\n5 Using and storing your beans: The beans can be strained and used right away, or cooled and stored in their cooking liquid. They will keep for up to a week refrigerated or up to 3 months in the freezer.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Cover and place in the refrigerator.\n2 Cook the quinoa: Put the quinoa in a fine mesh strainer and rinse it under cold water for about a minute. In a medium-sized pot, combine water, quinoa, 1 teaspoon oil, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.\nCover and cook over medium heat until the water is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, fluff with fork, and keep it covered.\n3 Toast the pepitas: Set a large skillet over medium heat. Add 1/2 teaspoon of olive oil. When the oil shimmers, add the pepitas and the salt. Stir frequently and toast for about 5 minutes until the seeds start popping and some parts turn a toasty brown.\nTransfer to a large plate. Scoot pepitas to one side. You\xe2\x80\x99ll put the sweet potatoes on the other side.\n4 Cook the sweet potatoes in sugar and spices: Using the same skillet you used to toast the pepitas, keep the heat at medium and add 2 teaspoons oil. Once the oil starts to shimmer, add the cubed potatoes. Stir to coat. Cook for about 1 minute. Stir again. Add the water. Cover and leave untouched for 5 minutes.\nCombine sugar, paprika, cayenne, and salt in a small bowl. Add the spice mixture to the potatoes. Stir to coat.\nCook uncovered for 7 additional minutes. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stir. The sugar should be caramelized, one side of the potatoes should be brown, and the potatoes should be tender but still hold together.\nRemove the potatoes from the skillet and place them on the plate alongside the pepitas. Tent with foil to keep them warm.\n5 Make the beans: Return the skillet to the burner over medium heat and add 1 teaspoon of olive oil. Once the oil shimmers, after about a minute, add the diced onion, garlic, oregano, cumin and bay leaf. Cook until the onions are softened, about 2 minutes.\nAdd the beans, 1/4 cup of water, and 1 teaspoon apple cider vinegar. Turn to medium-high, stirring occasionally until the liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes.\nDivide the beans evenly among four bowls. Wipe out the pan with a paper towel and set it over medium heat.\n6 Wilt the spinach: Add 3 tablespoons of water to the pan followed by all of the spinach. Drizzle with 2 teaspoons of olive oil and 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt. Toss gently until the spinach is wilted\xe2\x80\x94this should take about 2 minutes.\n7 Serve the bowls: To the bowls with the black beans, add a 1/2 cup of sweet potatoes, 1/2 cup quinoa, and the spinach. Top with toasted pepitas, crumbled cotija, a squeeze of lime, and a drizzle of creamy lime hot sauce.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

You can also start with three 15-ounce cans of whole black beans, in which case, skip to step 5, rinse and drain the beans and add to the pan with a little water in step 6.\nINGREDIENTS\nIngredients for cooking the dry beans:\n1 pound dry black beans\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/2 large white onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)\n1 garlic clove, minced\n2 teaspoons salt\n1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro (leaves and tender stems)\nAdditional ingredients for frying the beans after they've been cooked:\n1 teaspoon chipotle chili powder\n1 teaspoon chili powder\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/2 large white onion, chopped (about 1 1/2 cups)\n1 garlic clove, minced\nGreen onion\nCilantro\nCrumbled cotija or queso fresco cheese (omit for vegan version)\nTortilla chips or corn tortillas\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Soak dry beans: Place dry black beans in a bowl and add enough water to cover the beans by two inches. Let sit overnight.\nAlternatively, if you don't have time to soak the beans overnight, place the dry beans in a large bowl and pour boiling water over the beans, covering the beans with at least an inch of water, and let sit for one hour.\nNote, if your dry beans are a little old, or if you have reason to believe that they will be tough to cook (beans stored in hot or humid climates can get tough), you can add some salt to the water (1 1/2 teaspoons of salt 2 quarts of water) which at this stage will help the beans soften when they cook later.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 cumin, onion, garlic:  Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large thick-bottomed pot (the pot you will use to cook the beans) on medium high heat.\nAdd the cumin. Once the cumin is sizzling, add the chopped onion. Cook for 5 minutes or so, until translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for a minute more.\n3 Add drained beans and water, simmer 2 hours: Once the beans have soaked, they should have expanded noticeably. Drain the soaking liquid.\nAdd the drained beans and 2 quarts of water to the onions. Bring to a simmer. Partially cover the pot and lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Simmer for 2 hours.\n4 Add Salt and Cilantro, cook 30 min more: After the beans have simmered for 2 hours, add 2 teaspoons of salt (if you salted the soaking water in step 1, then taste first, and only add a teaspoon or so more of salt if you think it needs it).\nAdd 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro. Let cook uncovered for another half hour, or until the beans are tender.\n5 Saut\xc3\xa9 the spices, then add onions and cook: Heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil in a large frying pan on medium high heat. Add the chipotle powder, chili powder, and cumin.\nOnce the spices are sizzling, add the chopped white onion and cook until translucent.\nAdd the garlic and cook a minute more.\n6 Add beans, then mash: Add the cooked black beans (and liquid from the pot) to the frying pan. Use a potato masher to mash the beans in the pan.  Let them cook 3 to 4 minutes longer.\nIf the beans are a little soupy for your taste, just let them cook longer. If too thick or dry, add more water. Adjust seasonings to taste.\n7 Serve: Garnish with chopped green onions, fresh cilantro, and crumbled cotija or queso fresco cheese.\nServe with tortilla chips or corn or flour tortillas (corn if you are gluten-free). Great in tacos or burritos, or for a dip, or a side with steak.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Lower the heat to medium and cook until the onions are translucent, about 7-10 minutes more.\n4 Make garlic jalape\xc3\xb1o spice mixture: As the onions are cooking, work on the garlic spice mixture. Place the garlic and the jalape\xc3\xb1os in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until minced. Then add the oregano, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, and cornmeal and pulse everything until ground.\n5 Add spice mixture to pork and onions: Once the onions are cooked, add the spice mixture to the pork and onions.\n6 Add molasses, bell pepper, zest, cover and cook: Add the molasses, bell pepper, orange zest (if using), and water to the pot.

When the sauce starts bubbling, reduce the heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. (This sauce splatters everywhere once it heats up. Be prepared to wipe down your stovetop and countertops after making this!) Remove from heat.\nYou should have about 1 2/3 cups of sauce.  The sauce will keep for 1 to 2 weeks refrigerated.\n2 Cook the chicken (or substitute 2 cups shredded cooked chicken): Place the chicken breasts in a 4-quart or larger pot with a lid and pour the chicken broth over top. The chicken should be covered by about an inch; add additional broth or water if needed. Place over high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook for 10 minutes. Check that the chicken is cooked through and registers 165F in the thickest part. Cook another few minutes if needed.

If you are using the microwave, pour the rice into a large bowl and cover it with a damp paper towel. Microwave the rice on high for about 1 minute. Check to see if the rice has warmed through. If it is still cold in some spots, give everything a stir and continue microwaving at 15-second intervals, until the rice is heated to your liking.\n4 Assemble the burrito bowls: Divide the rice, chicken, corn, beans, romaine lettuce, and pico de gallo into 4 bowls. Top with cheese, if using, and then crush a few tortilla chips on top of each bowl for extra crunch.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

If the chicken breasts are not already thin cutlets, make them so by cutting them in half horizontally.\nThey should be no more than 3/4-inch thick at their thickest point. Trim the chicken breasts of excess fat, then add them to the marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.\n2 Soak chopped red onion for garnish in rice wine vinegar and water: Place 1/2 cup chopped red onion in a small bowl and add a couple tablespoons of rice wine vinegar, and enough water to just cover the onions. Chill until dish is ready for garnish.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions for black bean sauce: First, taste the liquid in the canned beans. If it tastes good, use it, if not, drain the can, and rinse the beans.

Place the chicken breasts on the grill, and grill until they are just cooked through (approximately 1 1/2 to 2 minutes on each side). Remove to platter when grilled.\nServe the grilled chicken with the black bean sauce. Sprinkle with the strained red onions, and garnish with sour cream, guacamole, tomatoes or fresh cilantro.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Cook for about 2 minutes, just to warm the black beans through.\n3 Warm the tortillas: Heat the second tablespoon of olive oil in a separate skillet or grill pan over medium high heat. Add 1 flour tortilla and let it heat up for a minute or so. Using tongs, flip the tortilla over, and repeat the process for the other side, until you see a couple of bubbles welling up in the center of the tortilla.\n4 Assemble the quesadilla: Layer the filling, then the avocado, and then the cheese\xe2\x80\x94about 1/4 cup of each, but if you want more cheese than that I\xe2\x80\x99m not the cheese police, so go for it!\n5 Cook the quesadilla: Fold the tortilla over to seal the quesadilla.

(The pot will take about 15 minutes to come up to pressure before the cooking program begins.)\n4 While the soup cooks, make the tortilla strips: Preheat a toaster oven, air fryer, or oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Pour the oil into a bowl large enough to toss the tortilla strips. Cut the tortillas into 1/4-inch strips, then toss them in the bowl with the oil.\nBake or air fry the tortillas until they are golden and slightly browned around the edges, about 7-9 minutes. Right when you take the strips out of the toaster oven or air fryer, sprinkle them with the salt. Set aside to cool.\n5 Release and serve or keep warm: When the cooking program ends on the Instant Pot, let the pressure release naturally for at least 15 minutes.

Rinse with cold water and drain.\nI used a combination of freshly roasted poblano chiles and pickled jalape\xc3\xb1os. This is because the poblanos I had were exceptionally mild and I wanted more heat, which I was able to get from the pickled jalape\xc3\xb1os. Use some combination of cooked green chiles, either canned or fresh. Taste for heat and adjust to your preference.\nINGREDIENTS\nBlack-eyed Pea Salsa\nAbout 3 1/4 to 4 cups cooked black-eyed peas (2 15.5-ounce cans, rinsed, drained)\n1/2 to 2/3 cups of chopped, cooked, mild green chiles (2 large poblanos or 3 Anaheims, roasted, seeded, and chopped) AND/OR 1/4 cup chopped pickled jalape\xc3\xb1os (to taste)\n1/2 to 2/3 cups of chopped roasted red bell pepper (can use jarred marinated or roast fresh red bell peppers by charring over a gas flame or under a broiler, placing in a covered bowl for a few minutes, wiping off the char, seeding, and chopping)\n6 to 8 green onions, thinly sliced including at least half of the greens, about 1/2 to 2/3 cup total\n1 bunch of cilantro, chopped, tender stems included (about a cup)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons red wine vinegar\n1 teaspoon dried oregano, crumbled\nLarge pinch of ground cumin\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\nQuesadillas\n1 dozen flour tortillas\n8 ounces Monterey jack cheese, sliced or grated\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nIf you haven't already done so, prep your ingredients. Char and peel your chiles and/or red bell peppers if using fresh not jarred or canned. Cook your black-eyed peas if not using canned.\n1 Assemble the salsa: Place the drained cooked black eyed peas in a large bowl. Add the chiles, red bell peppers, and most of the chopped onions and cilantro (reserving some for garnish).\nDrizzle with olive oil and red wine vinegar. Sprinkle with crumbled, dried oregano, cumin, salt, and pepper.\nToss and let marinate while you prepare the quesadillas.\n2 Make the quesadillas: Heat a large cast iron pan on medium high heat. If you are using something other than a well-seasoned cast iron pan, add a small amount of oil or butter to lightly coat the bottom of the pan. Add a flour tortilla to the pan. Let it heat up on one side for half a minute.\nFlip it over and place a light layer of cheese over the tortilla. If you are using grated cheese, you can just sprinkle it all over. If using sliced cheese, lay the slices down on only one side of the tortilla.\nWhen tortilla begins to form air pockets or the cheese begins to melt, use a spatula to lift up one edge of the tortilla and turn it over to the other edge, as if you were making an omelette.\nLet cook until lightly browned, and then flip the whole quesadilla over to the other side and let cook until lightly browned on that side. Remove from the pan and prepare the other quesadillas in the same manner.\n3 Cut the quesadillas into pie-shaped wedges and serve with the black-eyed pea salsa.\nHello!

This batch made 18 muffins.)\n2 Combine dry ingredients: Whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon and salt in a large bowl.\n3 Combine wet ingredients and sugar: In a separate bowl, whisk together eggs, sour cream, milk, sugar, butter and vanilla.\n4 Add wet ingredients to dry, then add berries: Add the wet mixture to the dry mixture, and mix together with a few light strokes, just until the dry ingredients are moistened.\nAdd the berries. (If you are using frozen berries, defrost them first, then drain the excess liquid, then coat them lightly in flour.)\nDo not over-mix! Over-mixing will cause the muffins to be dense, not fluffy. The batter should not be smooth, but rather lumpy.\n5 Put into muffin cups and bake: Divide the batter evenly among the muffin cups. Bake at 400\xc2\xb0F (200\xc2\xb0C) until a toothpick inserted into the middle of 1 or 2 of the muffins comes out clean, 17-20 minutes (or longer).\n6: Let cool: Let cool for 2 to 3 minutes before removing from the pan. If not serving hot, let cool on a rack.\nServe as soon as possible, preferably within a few hours of baking.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

You can boil or roast the beets to cook them.\nIf boiling, boil the beets separately by color (otherwise the red beets will run into the the orange, turning the orange beets red). Place each batch of beets in a pot and cover with water by about an inch. Add a couple teaspoons of salt. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Simmer until you can just pierce easily with a fork, 30 to 60 minutes, depending on the size of the beets. Drain. Let cool. Rub the skins off.\nTo roast the beets, wrap them in foil and roast them in a 400\xc2\xb0F oven for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, until fork tender. Then cool and peel. See our roasted beets recipe.\n2  While the beets are cooking, prepare the dressing and prep the rest of the ingredients. Place all of the dressing ingredients into a jar, cover and shake until well blended.\n3 Marinate beets in dressing: Cut the beets into 1/2-inch to 1-inch pieces. Separate by color and place in separate bowls and toss with a little of the dressing (use about a third of the dressing).

Celery bunches come in different sizes, so the amounts here are a little inexact. Just make sure you have enough blue cheese so that you get a little with every bite of the celery.\nINGREDIENTS\n6 ounces good quality blue cheese\n3/4 cup hazelnuts\n1 tablespoon butter\n3 tablespoons maple Syrup\nPinch of cayenne\nSalt\n2-3 bunches of celery, tops removed\n12-15 pitted dates (can sub with a handful of dried cranberries or cherries)\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil (or hazelnut oil if you happen to have it)\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n4 teaspoons lemon juice (if using Meyer lemons, use 2 Tbsp)\nFreshly ground black pepper\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Remove cheese from refrigerator to come to room temperature.\n2 Roast hazelnuts: Place hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet in a 300\xc2\xb0F oven for 30 minutes.\n3 Prep celery and dates: While the nuts are roasting, prepare the other ingredients. Use a vegetable peeler to peel away the tough outer strings of the stalks of celery. Slice the celery stalks on the diagonal into 1/4-inch thick slices.\nSlice the dates lengthwise first in half, then slice the halves lengthwise into 3 or four pieces. If the dates are on the large size, you may want to slice them in half widthwise first. You want to end up with pieces that are about an inch long and a 1/4 inch wide.\n4 Rub outer skin off hazelnuts: Once the hazelnuts have roasted for half an hour, remove them from the oven, let cool for a few minutes. Then rub the hazelnuts together inside of a clean dish towel to remove as much of the outer dark skin as you can.\n5 Glaze hazelnuts: Melt butter in a small skillet. Add a pinch of cayenne and salt. Add the roasted hazelnuts to the pan and toast them on medium low heat for a few minutes, continuously stirring.\nWhen the hazelnuts are hot, turn off the heat and add maple syrup to the pan. Stir to coat the hazelnuts in the maple syrup.\nLet glazed nuts sit in the pan to cool. Later you will scrape them loose with a wooden spoon and serve atop the salad.\n6 Prepare the salad dressing: In a small jar, mix together the olive oil, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Add salt and black pepper to taste. Shake to combine.\n7 Assemble salad: Layer a shallow platter or dish first with the sliced celery, then dates, then crumble the blue cheese over it and sprinkle with glazed hazelnuts. Right before serving, pour dressing over top.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'

You can substitute the 1/2 cup of buttermilk called for in the recipe with a 1/2 cup of milk to which has been added 1 1/2 teaspoons of vinegar or lemon juice (let sit for several minutes). Or you can mix in 1/4 cup of plain yogurt with 1/4 cup of milk.\nINGREDIENTS\nDry ingredients:\n2 cups all purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n2 Tbsp sugar\nOther ingredients:\n2 large eggs\n1/2 cup buttermilk\n1 cup milk\n3 Tbsp warm melted butter\n1 cup blueberries\nButter or vegetable oil\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make pancake batter: Whisk together the dry ingredients in a large bowl.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, then whisk in the milk, and buttermilk.\nPour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and combine, using a wooden spoon. Mix only until the batter just comes together.\nStir in the melted butter. Do not over-mix! The mixture should be a little lumpy. Lumpy is good. A lumpy batter makes fluffy pancakes.\nAt this point you can either gently fold in the blueberries, or wait until you pour the batter onto the griddle, and then place the blueberries into the surface of the pancake batter. Placing the blueberries into the pancakes while they are cooking will help keep them from bleeding.\n2 Ladle batter in hot pan: Heat a griddle or large pan on medium to medium high heat. (A large cast iron pan works great for cooking pancakes.)\nOil the pan with either a little butter or vegetable oil.\nLadle the pancake batter onto the griddle to the desired size (a quarter-cup measure works well for this), anywhere from 4 to 6 inches wide.\nIf you haven't already added the blueberries to the batter, you can place several in each pancake while it cooks.\n3 When you see air bubbles in the center, flip the pancakes over: When air bubbles start to bubble up to the surface at the center of the pancakes (about 2-3 minutes), use a flat metal spatula to flip them over.\nAfter a minute, peek under one for doneness. When golden or darker golden brown, they are done.\nNote that cooking the second side takes only about half as long as the first side. And the second side doesn't brown as evenly as the first side.\nContinue to make the batches of pancakes, putting a little oil or butter on the pan before each batch so the pancakes don't stick.\nServe immediately. Serve with butter, maple syrup, and extra blueberries.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"
b'Save It Print\nLemon Blueberry Scones Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 18 minutesChilling time: 2 hoursYield: 16 scones\nTo make the scones without a food processor: Whisk the dry ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Use a pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture looks sandy with only small gravel-sized bits of butter remaining. Pour the whisked yogurt and egg mixture over top, and use a wooden spoon or dough whisk to mix the wet and dry ingredients. Fold in the blueberries.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the scones:\n2 1/3 cup (300g) unbleached all-purpose flour\n1/4 cup (56g) granulated sugar\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n8 tablespoons (1 stick, 4 ounces) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n3/4 cup (170g) whole milk Greek yogurt\n1 large egg\n1 (6 ounce) container fresh blueberries, picked over for stems, rinsed, and dried\nFor the glaze:\n1 tablespoon lemon zest, from 1 medium lemon\n2 tablespoons lemon juice, from 1 medium lemon\n1 cup (120g) powdered sugar\nSpecial equipment:\nFood processor\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the dough in a food processor: Measure the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a food processor. Process the ingredients to combine them evenly.\nSprinkle the cubed butter over the flour mixture, and process the mixture in 1-second pulses until the butter is no longer visible and the mixture looks somewhat sandy.\nIn another mixing bowl, whisk together the yogurt and egg until no streaks of egg yolk remain. Pour this mixture into the food processor with the flour and the butter.\nRun the food processor for about three seconds, just until all of the flour is absorbed and the dough begins to come away from the sides of the bowl.\n2 Fold in the blueberries: Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Scatter the blueberries over top and fold the dough a few times with a spatula to incorporate. (You can also do this in a separate mixing bowl instead of on the counter, if you prefer.)\n3 Shape the dough into disks and chill: With a bench scraper or knife, divide the dough in half and pat into two disks, about 1/2-inch thick and six inches across (you can use the length of your hand as a guide).\nWrap the disks of dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least two hours, or up to 24 hours.\n4 Preheat the oven to 350F: Line a baking sheet with a silicon baking mat or parchment paper.\n5 Cut and bake the scones: Unwrap the disks of chilled dough and cut each one into eight wedges (16 wedges total).\nPlace the wedges an inch apart on the lined baking sheet. Try not to touch the sides or handle the scones too much as you transfer them since this can inhibit how much they rise in the oven.\nBake the scones for 15 to 18 minutes, until they are lightly browned.\n6 Make the glaze: While the scones are baking, whisk together the lemon zest, lemon juice, and powdered sugar in a small bowl. The glaze should be a pourable consistency; add additional lemon juice (or milk, or water) 1 teaspoon at a time if needed.\n7 Glaze and cool the scones: Transfer the scones to a cooling rack with something underneath to catch any dripping glaze (I use wax paper). While the scones are still warm, drizzle each one with a teaspoon of the glaze. Let the scones cool until the glaze has fully set, about 30 minutes.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nBlueberry Sorbet Recipe\nYield: Makes a little less than a quart\nIf you want your sorbet to last a while in the freezer, and not get too rock hard, you might want to add a tablespoon or two of corn syrup to the mix. Or you can add 2 tablespoons of kirsch or a berry or orange liqueur.\nINGREDIENTS\n5 cups fresh or frozen blueberries, rinsed, stems removed and discarded\n1/4 cup sugar\n1/4 cup honey\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n1 Tbsp lemon juice\nPinch salt\nFresh blueberries and sprigs of mint for garnish\nMETHOD\n1 Place the blueberries, sugar, honey, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt in a large bowl. Stir to coat blueberries with the sugar. Mash with a potato masher.\n2 Put the mashed blueberries into a blender and blend for a couple of minutes until smooth.\n3 Place a sieve over a large bowl and working in batches, press the mixture through the sieve, using a rubber spatula. This will catch the tougher and larger pieces of lemon and blueberry peel.\n4 Chill the mixture for at least an hour in the fridge. Then process following the directions of your ice cream maker.\nEat immediately (the sorbet will still be a little soft) or freeze at least a few hours to help firm up before eating. Eat soon after making though, as the sorbet will get progressively harder the longer it stays in the freezer.\nServe with a few fresh blueberries and a sprig of mint.\nHello!

Butter and line an 9x9 inch pan with parchment paper leaving an overhang on two sides.\n2 Make the dough: In a food processor, pulse the flour, sugar, lemon zest, and salt together a few times to combine. Add the butter and pulse until you get a fine, sandy texture\xe2\x80\x94all of the butter should be incorporated.\nAdd the egg yolk and pulse until it\xe2\x80\x99s combined, 10 to 15 times. The crumbs should hold together when squeezed in the palm of your hand. If they do not, sprinkle a tablespoon of water over top and pulse a few more times.\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a food processor, you can cut the butter into the flour with a pastry blender or a fork. It will take longer, but work just fine.\n  3 Refrigerate the crumb topping: Scoop out about 1/3 of the crumb mixture and press it into a bowl, which helps to make larger clumps of crumbs for the topping. Cover and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes or until needed for the topping.\n4 Press the bottom crust into the pan: Firmly press the remaining 2/3 of the crumbs into the bottom of the prepared pan to create the base for the bars. I like to use a measuring cup to press the crumbs into the pan and really compact the crust.\n5 Make the blueberry filling and top with crumbs: In a mixing bowl, toss the blueberries with the sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and zest together to coat. Spread the berries over the crust.\nRemove the remaining crumb mixture from the fridge and crumble. Crumble it with your fingers and sprinkled over the blueberry filling.\n6 Bake the crumb bars: Bake for 1 hour and 5 minutes, or until the blueberries are bubbling and the crumb topping is golden. Remove the bars from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Cool completely in the pan, at least 2 hours, before lifting from the pan using the parchment and cutting into squares.\nOnce cooled and sliced, the bars can be transferred to an airtight container and kept at room temperature for about a week.\nHello!

Mix together with a fork or wooden spoon just until the dough comes together. Form it into a ball. It should be rather shaggy. Do not knead or over work it or the dumplings will be tough.\n2 Heat the blueberries: Place the blueberries, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, lemon zest, and water into a medium (2 quart) saucepan. Stir so that the berries are well coated with everything. Heat on high heat until the berries start to boil.\n3 Add the dumplings: When the blueberry mixture is boiling, pull off clumps of dumpling dough from the ball of dough and place on top of the berries. You should have enough dough for 6 dumplings, so portion accordingly.\n4 Cover and cook: Cover the pan, and lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 25 minutes.\nDo not uncover to peek at the dumplings while cooking! The dumplings need the steady steam and pressure from being covered to cook properly so they are light and fluffy.\n5 Serve: Portion into individual serving bowls and top with vanilla ice cream or whipping cream.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nBlueberry Muffins Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Makes one dozen muffins\nIf you are using frozen berries, you can use them frozen, just separate them so they're not sticking together and toss them in flour to coat. Your cooking time may need to increase by a few minutes.\nSome brands of sour cream are much thicker than others. Feel free to dilute the sour cream with a little water if you think it's too thick. You can also substitute the sour cream with plain yogurt; if you do, you likely will not need both tablespoons of added milk.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, plus 1 tablespoon for dusting the blueberries\n1 tablespoon baking powder (make sure your baking powder is still good! click to see how)\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n8 tablespoons butter (1 stick), melted\n1 cup sugar\n2 large eggs\n1 1/2 cup plain sour cream\n2 tablespoons milk\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n1 1/2 cups blueberries, fresh or frozen (see Recipe Note)\nSpecial equipment:\nStandard 12-cup muffin tin\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven and prep the muffin tin: Preheat your oven to 400\xc2\xb0F with a rack in the lower middle.

b"Save It Print\nBlueberry Buttermilk Pancakes Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Serves 3-4\nDon't have buttermilk? You can substitute the 1/2 cup of buttermilk called for in the recipe with a 1/2 cup of milk to which has been added 1 1/2 teaspoons of vinegar or lemon juice (let sit for several minutes). Or you can mix in 1/4 cup of plain yogurt with 1/4 cup of milk.\nINGREDIENTS\nDry ingredients:\n2 cups all purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n2 Tbsp sugar\nOther ingredients:\n2 large eggs\n1/2 cup buttermilk\n1 cup milk\n3 Tbsp warm melted butter\n1 cup blueberries\nButter or vegetable oil\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make pancake batter: Whisk together the dry ingredients in a large bowl.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk the eggs, then whisk in the milk, and buttermilk.\nPour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and combine, using a wooden spoon. Mix only until the batter just comes together.\nStir in the melted butter. Do not over-mix! The mixture should be a little lumpy. Lumpy is good. A lumpy batter makes fluffy pancakes.\nAt this point you can either gently fold in the blueberries, or wait until you pour the batter onto the griddle, and then place the blueberries into the surface of the pancake batter. Placing the blueberries into the pancakes while they are cooking will help keep them from bleeding.\n2 Ladle batter in hot pan: Heat a griddle or large pan on medium to medium high heat. (A large cast iron pan works great for cooking pancakes.)\nOil the pan with either a little butter or vegetable oil.\nLadle the pancake batter onto the griddle to the desired size (a quarter-cup measure works well for this), anywhere from 4 to 6 inches wide.\nIf you haven't already added the blueberries to the batter, you can place several in each pancake while it cooks.\n3 When you see air bubbles in the center, flip the pancakes over: When air bubbles start to bubble up to the surface at the center of the pancakes (about 2-3 minutes), use a flat metal spatula to flip them over.\nAfter a minute, peek under one for doneness. When golden or darker golden brown, they are done.\nNote that cooking the second side takes only about half as long as the first side. And the second side doesn't brown as evenly as the first side.\nContinue to make the batches of pancakes, putting a little oil or butter on the pan before each batch so the pancakes don't stick.\nServe immediately. Serve with butter, maple syrup, and extra blueberries.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nLemon Blueberry Scones Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 18 minutesChilling time: 2 hoursYield: 16 scones\nTo make the scones without a food processor: Whisk the dry ingredients in a medium mixing bowl. Use a pastry cutter to work the butter into the flour mixture until the mixture looks sandy with only small gravel-sized bits of butter remaining. Pour the whisked yogurt and egg mixture over top, and use a wooden spoon or dough whisk to mix the wet and dry ingredients. Fold in the blueberries.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the scones:\n2 1/3 cup (300g) unbleached all-purpose flour\n1/4 cup (56g) granulated sugar\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n8 tablespoons (1 stick, 4 ounces) unsalted butter, cut into 1/2-inch cubes\n3/4 cup (170g) whole milk Greek yogurt\n1 large egg\n1 (6 ounce) container fresh blueberries, picked over for stems, rinsed, and dried\nFor the glaze:\n1 tablespoon lemon zest, from 1 medium lemon\n2 tablespoons lemon juice, from 1 medium lemon\n1 cup (120g) powdered sugar\nSpecial equipment:\nFood processor\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the dough in a food processor: Measure the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt into a food processor. Process the ingredients to combine them evenly.\nSprinkle the cubed butter over the flour mixture, and process the mixture in 1-second pulses until the butter is no longer visible and the mixture looks somewhat sandy.\nIn another mixing bowl, whisk together the yogurt and egg until no streaks of egg yolk remain. Pour this mixture into the food processor with the flour and the butter.\nRun the food processor for about three seconds, just until all of the flour is absorbed and the dough begins to come away from the sides of the bowl.\n2 Fold in the blueberries: Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface. Scatter the blueberries over top and fold the dough a few times with a spatula to incorporate. (You can also do this in a separate mixing bowl instead of on the counter, if you prefer.)\n3 Shape the dough into disks and chill: With a bench scraper or knife, divide the dough in half and pat into two disks, about 1/2-inch thick and six inches across (you can use the length of your hand as a guide).\nWrap the disks of dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least two hours, or up to 24 hours.\n4 Preheat the oven to 350F: Line a baking sheet with a silicon baking mat or parchment paper.\n5 Cut and bake the scones: Unwrap the disks of chilled dough and cut each one into eight wedges (16 wedges total).\nPlace the wedges an inch apart on the lined baking sheet. Try not to touch the sides or handle the scones too much as you transfer them since this can inhibit how much they rise in the oven.\nBake the scones for 15 to 18 minutes, until they are lightly browned.\n6 Make the glaze: While the scones are baking, whisk together the lemon zest, lemon juice, and powdered sugar in a small bowl. The glaze should be a pourable consistency; add additional lemon juice (or milk, or water) 1 teaspoon at a time if needed.\n7 Glaze and cool the scones: Transfer the scones to a cooling rack with something underneath to catch any dripping glaze (I use wax paper). While the scones are still warm, drizzle each one with a teaspoon of the glaze. Let the scones cool until the glaze has fully set, about 30 minutes.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nBlueberry Sorbet Recipe\nYield: Makes a little less than a quart\nIf you want your sorbet to last a while in the freezer, and not get too rock hard, you might want to add a tablespoon or two of corn syrup to the mix. Or you can add 2 tablespoons of kirsch or a berry or orange liqueur.\nINGREDIENTS\n5 cups fresh or frozen blueberries, rinsed, stems removed and discarded\n1/4 cup sugar\n1/4 cup honey\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n1 Tbsp lemon juice\nPinch salt\nFresh blueberries and sprigs of mint for garnish\nMETHOD\n1 Place the blueberries, sugar, honey, lemon zest, lemon juice, and salt in a large bowl. Stir to coat blueberries with the sugar. Mash with a potato masher.\n2 Put the mashed blueberries into a blender and blend for a couple of minutes until smooth.\n3 Place a sieve over a large bowl and working in batches, press the mixture through the sieve, using a rubber spatula. This will catch the tougher and larger pieces of lemon and blueberry peel.\n4 Chill the mixture for at least an hour in the fridge. Then process following the directions of your ice cream maker.\nEat immediately (the sorbet will still be a little soft) or freeze at least a few hours to help firm up before eating. Eat soon after making though, as the sorbet will get progressively harder the longer it stays in the freezer.\nServe with a few fresh blueberries and a sprig of mint.\nHello!

Butter and line an 9x9 inch pan with parchment paper leaving an overhang on two sides.\n2 Make the dough: In a food processor, pulse the flour, sugar, lemon zest, and salt together a few times to combine. Add the butter and pulse until you get a fine, sandy texture\xe2\x80\x94all of the butter should be incorporated.\nAdd the egg yolk and pulse until it\xe2\x80\x99s combined, 10 to 15 times. The crumbs should hold together when squeezed in the palm of your hand. If they do not, sprinkle a tablespoon of water over top and pulse a few more times.\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a food processor, you can cut the butter into the flour with a pastry blender or a fork. It will take longer, but work just fine.\n  3 Refrigerate the crumb topping: Scoop out about 1/3 of the crumb mixture and press it into a bowl, which helps to make larger clumps of crumbs for the topping. Cover and refrigerate for at least 15 minutes or until needed for the topping.\n4 Press the bottom crust into the pan: Firmly press the remaining 2/3 of the crumbs into the bottom of the prepared pan to create the base for the bars. I like to use a measuring cup to press the crumbs into the pan and really compact the crust.\n5 Make the blueberry filling and top with crumbs: In a mixing bowl, toss the blueberries with the sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice, and zest together to coat. Spread the berries over the crust.\nRemove the remaining crumb mixture from the fridge and crumble. Crumble it with your fingers and sprinkled over the blueberry filling.\n6 Bake the crumb bars: Bake for 1 hour and 5 minutes, or until the blueberries are bubbling and the crumb topping is golden. Remove the bars from the oven and transfer to a cooling rack. Cool completely in the pan, at least 2 hours, before lifting from the pan using the parchment and cutting into squares.\nOnce cooled and sliced, the bars can be transferred to an airtight container and kept at room temperature for about a week.\nHello!

Mix together with a fork or wooden spoon just until the dough comes together. Form it into a ball. It should be rather shaggy. Do not knead or over work it or the dumplings will be tough.\n2 Heat the blueberries: Place the blueberries, sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, lemon juice, lemon zest, and water into a medium (2 quart) saucepan. Stir so that the berries are well coated with everything. Heat on high heat until the berries start to boil.\n3 Add the dumplings: When the blueberry mixture is boiling, pull off clumps of dumpling dough from the ball of dough and place on top of the berries. You should have enough dough for 6 dumplings, so portion accordingly.\n4 Cover and cook: Cover the pan, and lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 25 minutes.\nDo not uncover to peek at the dumplings while cooking! The dumplings need the steady steam and pressure from being covered to cook properly so they are light and fluffy.\n5 Serve: Portion into individual serving bowls and top with vanilla ice cream or whipping cream.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nSkillet Chicken with Baby Bok Choy Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: 4 servings\nThis recipe goes well with a side of steamed rice. Put a pot of rice on the stove before you begin cooking the chicken and bok choy, and the rice should be ready around the same time as the chicken.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup chicken broth\n1 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce (or tamari, if gluten-free)\n1 tablespoon corn starch\n1 pound chicken breast cutlets or fillets\n2 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n1 pound (6 to 8 small heads) baby bok choy, halved lengthwise\n2 cloves garlic, chopped\n1 teaspoon sesame seeds (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the sauce and the chicken fillets: In a small bowl, whisk together the chicken broth, soy sauce, and corn starch. Season the chicken fillets lightly on both sides with salt and pepper.\n2 Sear the bok choy: Heat one tablespoon of the olive oil in a large skillet over high heat. When the oil begins to shimmer and you see a wisp of smoke rise from the skillet, use a pair of kitchen tongs to add the bok choy to the skillet in a single layer, sliced side down. It's fine to crowd the pan for this recipe. Be careful as you add the bok choy since the oil will sputter a bit; wear oven mitts if needed.\nSear the bok choy until it has some color on the bottom, about 2 minutes, then turn over and sear on the other side for another 2 minutes. Transfer the cooked bok choy to a serving plate.\n3 Sear the chicken: Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Add the chicken fillets to the pan. Sear the fillets for 4 minutes a side, until just cooked through and well browned. Transfer the cooked fillets to the serving plate on top of the bok choy.\n4 Make the sauce: Add the garlic to the skillet and stir just until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Give the broth/soy sauce mixture a final stir to mix in any cornstarch that has settled to the bottom of the bowl, then pour the mixture into the skillet. Use a wooden spoon to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the skillet. Simmer the sauce until thickened.\n5 To serve: Pour the sauce over chicken and bok choy.

b"Print\nBourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Wings Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: Makes 15 to 20 pieces\nIf you buy whole chicken wings, cut away and discard the wing tips (or save for stock), and separate the drumettes from the rest of the wing with a cleaver or a sharp knife. Single segment wing pieces are much easier to eat as finger food.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds chicken wings\n1 Tbsp butter\n2 Tbsp grated onion (use small hole grater)\n1/2 cup bourbon whisky\n3/4 cup maple syrup (grade A)\n2 Tbsp tomato paste\n2-inch sprig fresh rosemary (or 1 teaspoon dry)\n1 1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n1/4 teaspoon Tabasco (more or less to taste)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the bourbon maple glaze: Melt butter in a medium saucepan on medium heat. Add the grated onion and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.\nAdd the bourbon whisky, the maple syrup, tomato paste, rosemary, salt, pepper, and Tabasco. Whisk to combine. Bring to a low simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes.\n  2 (Optional) Marinate the wings in the glaze: If you want you can marinate the wings for an hour, or overnight in the glaze. Just let the glaze cool for a few minutes, then toss half of the glaze mixture in a bowl with the wings, cover with plastic wrap and chill. Reserve the remaining half of the glaze mixture to glaze the wings at the end.\n3 Coat wings with glaze and arrange on roasting pan: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. If you haven't marinated the wings, place them in a bowl and pour half of the bourbon maple sauce over the wings, returning the remaining sauce to the stovetop.\nToss the wings with the sauce to coat.\nArrange the wings on an oiled, foil-lined baking pan, with space between each wing.\n4 Roast the wings: Roast the wings at 350\xc2\xb0F for 20 minutes, then turn the wings over and roast them an additional 15 to 25 minutes, or until nicely browned. Lower the heat or remove from oven if the wings start getting too dark.\n5 Boil remaining glaze until thickened: While the wings are roasting, boil the remaining sauce until it thickens slightly and can coat the back of a spoon, then remove from heat.\nIf it is taking too long for the sauce to reduce, pour it into a wide shallow pan and bring to a boil. The wider pan will make sauce evaporate more easily.\n6 Coat cooked wings in glaze: When wings are done, remove them to a bowl and toss with the remaining sauce.\nHello!

b"Print\nBourbon Barbecue Sauce Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: Makes enough for 4-6 racks of ribs\nNote that most (not all) of the alcohol from the bourbon will boil away while the sauce reduces, leaving bourbon's distinctive caramel-flavored tang.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/4 cup vegetable oil, such as canola or peanut\n1/4 cup butter\n1 chopped chile pepper, such as a serrano\n1 medium yellow or white onion, grated\n1 cup bourbon or Tennessee whiskey\n1/2 cup ketchup or tomato sauce\n1/2 cup lemon juice\n1/2 cup apple cider vinegar\n1/3 cup dark molasses\n1/3 cup Worcestershire sauce\n2-3 tablespoons brown sugar\nSalt to taste\nMETHOD\n1 Heat the butter and oil in a sauce pan over medium-high heat.\n2 Grate the onion through the coarse grate of a box grater, or finely mince the onion if you don't have a grater.\n3 Add grated onion and chile to the oil/butter combination and cook over medium heat for 3-4 minutes, or until onions turn translucent. You do not want the onions to turn color.\n4 Add the bourbon: Take the pan off the heat and add the bourbon. Return to the stove, turn up the heat to medium-high again and boil down the bourbon for 5 minutes.\n5 Add the ketchup, lemon juice, vinegar, Worcestershire sauce, molasses, and the sugar. Mix well and return to a simmer.\n6 Cook the sauce for a few minutes to combine the flavors and then taste test it. Is it salty enough? (It should be from the Worcestershire sauce). If not, add salt. Is it spicy hot enough? If not, add a little cayenne powder. Is it sweet enough? If not, add some molasses.\n7 Let the sauce cook down slowly until it thickens, about 20 minutes. Keep it on low heat while your ribs cook. Alternatively, you can make this sauce ahead of time and reheat it when you cook the meat. It will stay good in the fridge at least a week; I've held mine for two weeks with no problem.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nCoffee Bourbon Chocolate Chip Ice Cream Recipe\nYield: Makes one quart\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups heavy whipping cream, separated 1 cup and 1 cup\n1 1/4 cups milk\n7/8 cup of sugar\nPinch of salt\n1 cup dark roasted coffee beans (use decaf beans if avoiding caffeine)\n6 egg yolks\n2 to 3 Tbsp bourbon\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n5 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped into chip-sized chunks\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Steep the coffee beans in milk, cream, with sugar and salt, then strain: Place the milk, 1 cup of the cream, sugar, salt, and coffee beans in a medium saucepan and heat on medium heat until little bubbles form at the edge of the pan and the milk cream mixture is steamy. Remove from heat, cover, and let sit for 1 hour.\nAfter the beans have steeped in the hot milk cream mixture for an hour, strain the mixture and discard the beans.\n2 Chill remaining cream in an ice bath: While the beans are infusing the milk cream mixture, place the remaining 1 cup of cream in a medium metal bowl, set over ice water in a larger bowl. Place a mesh strainer over the the bowl.\n3 Temper the eggs with the hot milk cream mixture: Return the milk cream mixture to the saucepan and heat on medium heat until once again steamy. Do not let boil. Whisk the egg yolks in a separate, medium bowl. While whisking the egg yolks, slowly add to the egg yolks some of the hot milk cream mixture. It helps to use a ladle for this. You'll want to add about half of your milk cream mixture. (This step is to temper the eggs to help prevent curdling.) Pour the egg mixture into the saucepan with the rest of the milk cream mixture.\n4 Heat the ice cream base until it starts to thicken: Slowly heat the custard base on medium heat, stirring with a wooden spoon, until the mixture thickens and coats the back of the spoon. When you can easily run your finger across the back of the spoon and have the mixture not run, take the saucepan off the heat.\n5 Strain mixture into chilled cream: Immediately pour the hot custard mixture through the strainer over the rest of the cream in the ice bath. This will help cool down the mixture quickly. Some curdles may have formed, if so the strainer will catch them.\n6 Chill several hours: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for several hours (preferably overnight) until well chilled.\n7 Stir in bourbon and vanilla: When ready to process in your ice cream maker, stir in the bourbon and the vanilla extract. Do not use more than 2 1/2 tablespoons of bourbon or your ice cream will not get firm. (Use no more than 3 Tbsp of bourbon, or the ice cream will have a hard time freezing.)\n8 Process in ice cream maker: Process in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n9 Add chocolate chips: Once processed, stir in the chocolate chips and place in a container into the freezer.

Sprinkle both sides of pork chops with salt and pepper. Dip chops into the flour, then egg mixture, then breadcrumbs, coating completely.\n3 Cook the chops on both sides: Heat olive or canola oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the pork chops and cook until brown, about 4 minutes per side. If your pork chops are thin cuts, this may be all the cooking they need. If thicker, lower the heat to low and cover the pot. Cook for a few minutes more until the chops are just cooked through, about 145\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Finish the sauce: When about to serve the pork, bring the sauce to a simmer and add the chopped basil to it.

b"Print\nGrilled Spicy Citrus Ribs with Bourbon Glaze Recipe\nYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\nRibs\n2 racks of ribs (about 4 pounds), St. Louis-cut spareribs or baby back ribs*\n2 1/2 cups spicy citrus brine\nOil for the grill grate\n1 cup spicy bourbon syrup\n* St. Louis Style ribs are spareribs that have been trimmed of skirt meat and excess cartilage. More meaty than baby back ribs. Baby back ribs are smaller and leaner than St. Louis Style ribs and may cook more quickly (and dry out more easily).\nSpicy Citrus Brine\n1 1/4 cup freshly squeezed orange juice (about 3 oranges)\n1/2 cup freshly squeezed lemon juice (about 2 lemons)\n1/4 cup freshly squeezed lime juice (1-2 limes)\n1/4 cup water\n2 Tbsp Kosher salt\n1 teaspoon dried thyme\n1 Tbsp crushed red pepper flakes\nSpicy Bourbon Glaze\n1 cup bourbon whiskey\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n1/2 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes\n2 teaspoons salt\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n2 Tbsp butter\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the brine: Combine the juices and water and measure in a measuring cup. You should have exactly 2 1/2 cups liquid. If you have less, add enough water so that you have 2 1/2 cups of liquid, if you have more, discard the excess. The correct ratio of liquid to salt is important for the brine to work properly.\nPlace liquids in a medium sized bowl, add other brine ingredients\xe2\x80\x94salt, thyme, and red pepper flakes. Stir for half a minute until the salt has completely dissolved.\n2 Prepare the ribs: If you want, remove the thin membrane that lines the concave side of each rib rack. This will make it easier for the brine and spices to penetrate as well as easier to cut and eat when the ribs are done. Insert a dull knife edge between the membrane and ribs to loosen. Grip the loosened membrane and pull away to remove.\nCut the racks in half. Put in a plastic ziplock freezer bag. Add the brine to the bag. Squeeze the excess air out of the bag and seal the bag. Massage the brine into the ribs. Place the bag of brine and ribs into a bowl (in case there is leakage) and place into the refrigerator.\nRefrigerate in the brine for 3-6 hours. Note that brining too long can over-saturate the meat with the brine. So stick within the 3-6 hour time frame.\n3 Prepare bourbon glaze: Heat bourbon with sugar, peppers, and salt. Whisk in butter until melted. Set aside or refrigerate for up to 2 weeks. Warm before using. You can also prepare while the meat is cooking in the next step.\n4 Prepare the grill for indirect heat: On a gas grill, heat the grill to medium heat 300-325\xc2\xb0F with the middle burners turned off (if a 3 or 4 burner grill) or one burner turned off (if a 2 burner grill).\nFor a kettle grill with charcoal, use 3-4 pounds of briquets pushed to one side of the grill. An aluminum disposable drip pan set next to the briquets, underneath where the meat will be, will help keep your grill easier to clean. (I forgot this time, notice no drip pan in the photo, and now the grill's a mess.)\n5 Place ribs on grill, adjust vents, maintain low heat: Remove the ribs from the brining bag. Pat dry the ribs with paper towels. Brush grill grates with olive oil or canola oil. Place the ribs on the side of the grill away from the source of heat, either gas or briquets. Cover the grill.\nIf you are using a gas grill, lower the burners so that you are maintaining a temperature of about 300\xc2\xb0F-325\xc2\xb0F in the grill.\nIf you are charcoal grilling, cover the grill so that the air vent on the kettle top is directly over the ribs. This way smoke from the charcoal will waft its way over the ribs on the way out of the grill.\nAdjust the vents so that the air flow is much reduced. Reducing the size of the air vents is a way to help control the temperature in the grill and keep it low. Fire lives off of oxygen, so if you reduce the oxygen, you reduce the amount of burning and heat. If you close the vents too much, the charcoals will put out too little heat, so the trick is to maintain a balance - enough air flow to keep the coals alive, but not too much or the grill will run too hot and your ribs will overcook.\nTry to maintain a temperature of about 300\xc2\xb0F-325\xc2\xb0F in the grill. If you are using a charcoal grill that doesn't have a built-in thermometer, you can put a meat thermometer through the grill air vent to take a reading of the temp.\n6 Flip ribs over, check for doneness: After 20-25 minutes of cooking, use tongs to flip the rib racks over. If you are charcoal grilling, shift the ends of the ribs as well so that the end that was facing the coals now faces the edge of the grill.\nCheck for doneness using a meat thermometer after 15-20 more minutes. They are done and ready to pull off at 155\xc2\xb0F, but you want to get to them 10 minutes or so before they are done to apply the glaze.\n7 Apply bourbon glaze: At about 145\xc2\xb0F start applying the spicy bourbon glaze. Brush the ribs with the glaze syrup, turning and basting the ribs until the syrup has been used up. When an instant read thermometer, inserted into the thickest part of the ribs reads 155\xc2\xb0F, the ribs are ready to take off the grill.\nNote that depending on the amount of heat in the grill and the size of your ribs, the ribs could be done in as little as 45 minutes or as long as 1 1/2 hours. If the grill temperature stays more at about 350\xc2\xb0F, then the ribs will be done faster. It's hard to maintain a charcoal grill lower than 350\xc2\xb0F, though ideally for these ribs you do want the temp lower, closer to 300\xc2\xb0F. Also note again that baby backs are smaller than St. Louis style and will cook faster.\n8 Remove the ribs to a large serving platter and cut into 1 or 2-rib sections.\nHello!

b"Print\nMint Julep Ice Cream Recipe\nYield: Makes about 1 quart\nINGREDIENTS\n2 ounces of mint leaves (spearmint)\n1 1/2 cups of milk\n1 1/2 cups of cream\n6 egg yolks, whisked together\n3/4 cup of sugar\n1/4 teaspoon of kosher salt\n1/4 cup of bourbon\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Steep mint in hot cream: Bruise the leaves with a wooden spoon so they'll release their essential oils and flavors. Place them in a saucepan with the milk and 3/4 cup of the cream. Bring just to a simmer, then remove from heat and cover to steep for 30 minutes.\n  2 Prepare sieve over bowl with cream, over ice bath: Fill a large bowl with ice water and set another bowl with the remaining cream in it with a fine mesh sieve over the cream. In a separate bowl whisk together the egg yolks.\n3 Strain mint cream, add sugar, salt, then heat until steamy: Pour the steeped cream mixture through a strainer and toss the mint leaves. Return the milk/cream mixture to the saucepan and add the sugar and salt. Set over medium heat and heat until steaming (not boiling).\n  4 Temper eggs, return to milk mixture: Slowly pour some of the heated milk mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly so that the egg yolks are tempered by the heated milk, but not cooked by it. Pour the egg yolk mixture back into the saucepan.\n5 Heat until thickened: Stir the mixture over medium heat with a wooden spoon, constantly scraping the bottom of the pan as you stir. When the mixture thickens up and coats the back of the spoon so that you can run your finger across the coating and have the coating not run. This can take between 3 and 10 minutes depending on the heat of your burner.\n  6 Strain through sieve, add bourbon and vanilla, chill: Pour the mixture through the sieve into the chilled bowl of cream. Mix in the bourbon and vanilla. Cover and place in the refrigerator until the mixture is chilled, 6 hours to overnight.\n7 Process in ice cream maker: Process in an ice cream machine per the manufacturer's instructions.\n8 Store in freezer: Store ice cream in an airtight contained in the freezer for several hours before serving to harden the mixture up a bit. The ice cream will be quite soft straight out of the ice cream machine and will need to harden up a bit for proper ice cream consistency. If you leave it in the freezer too long, just let it sit a few minutes before serving.\n*Note: You cannot substitute anything for the bourbon in this recipe. Otherwise, it's not a mint julep. That said, you can make a simple mint ice cream, if you don't want to use alcohol. Check out the mint chocolate chip recipe on the site.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

It will continue to thicken as it cools.\n6 Glaze the meatloaf: When the meatloaf has about five minutes left of baking, add 1/4 cup of glaze to the top of the meatloaf and let it finish cooking.\n7 Serve: Let the loaf cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then unmold and serve (or serve from the pan). Serve the rest of the glaze on the side for people to drizzle onto their slices.\nLeftovers can be kept in the fridge for a few days. If you want to freeze this meatloaf, I recommend slicing it and freezing individually wrapped slices, rather than freezing the entire loaf, which will be difficult to defrost later. Reheat slices in a medium-heat skillet with a drizzle of oil until warmed through, 4 to 5 minutes.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nBourbon Maple Glazed Chicken Wings Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: Makes 15 to 20 pieces\nIf you buy whole chicken wings, cut away and discard the wing tips (or save for stock), and separate the drumettes from the rest of the wing with a cleaver or a sharp knife. Single segment wing pieces are much easier to eat as finger food.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds chicken wings\n1 Tbsp butter\n2 Tbsp grated onion (use small hole grater)\n1/2 cup bourbon whisky\n3/4 cup maple syrup (grade A)\n2 Tbsp tomato paste\n2-inch sprig fresh rosemary (or 1 teaspoon dry)\n1 1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n1/4 teaspoon Tabasco (more or less to taste)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the bourbon maple glaze: Melt butter in a medium saucepan on medium heat. Add the grated onion and cook for 2 to 3 minutes.\nAdd the bourbon whisky, the maple syrup, tomato paste, rosemary, salt, pepper, and Tabasco. Whisk to combine. Bring to a low simmer. Simmer for 5 minutes.\n  2 (Optional) Marinate the wings in the glaze: If you want you can marinate the wings for an hour, or overnight in the glaze. Just let the glaze cool for a few minutes, then toss half of the glaze mixture in a bowl with the wings, cover with plastic wrap and chill. Reserve the remaining half of the glaze mixture to glaze the wings at the end.\n3 Coat wings with glaze and arrange on roasting pan: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. If you haven't marinated the wings, place them in a bowl and pour half of the bourbon maple sauce over the wings, returning the remaining sauce to the stovetop.\nToss the wings with the sauce to coat.\nArrange the wings on an oiled, foil-lined baking pan, with space between each wing.\n4 Roast the wings: Roast the wings at 350\xc2\xb0F for 20 minutes, then turn the wings over and roast them an additional 15 to 25 minutes, or until nicely browned. Lower the heat or remove from oven if the wings start getting too dark.\n5 Boil remaining glaze until thickened: While the wings are roasting, boil the remaining sauce until it thickens slightly and can coat the back of a spoon, then remove from heat.\nIf it is taking too long for the sauce to reduce, pour it into a wide shallow pan and bring to a boil. The wider pan will make sauce evaporate more easily.\n6 Coat cooked wings in glaze: When wings are done, remove them to a bowl and toss with the remaining sauce.\nHello!

b'Print\nStuffed Herbed Chicken with Boursin Cheese Recipe\nYield: Serves 2-4\nWe are using chicken breasts instead of already cut chicken cutlets for this recipe because when we pound the breasts thin, they will spread out sufficiently for us to roll them up.\nINGREDIENTS\nIngredients\n2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, 1/2-pound each\nFresh basil leaves (or other green - beet green, swiss chard, spinach), enough to cover each chicken breast\n2 Tbsp finely chopped toasted walnuts\n2.5 oz Boursin garlic and herb cheese (or 2.5 oz of herbed cream cheese recipe, see below), room temperature\n1/3 cup breadcrumbs\n3 Tbsp grated Parmesan cheese\n1 egg, beaten well\nSalt\nPepper\nHerbed Cheese\n2.5 oz cream cheese, softened\n1 garlic clove, minced\n3 teaspoons fresh parsley, minced\n3 teaspoons fresh chives, minced\nA pinch of cayenne\n1/4 teaspoon freshly cracked black peppercorns\nA pinch salt\nMETHOD\n1 Pound the chicken breasts to 1/4 inch thickness: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Put each chicken breast between two layers of plastic wrap, on a chopping board, and use a meat mallet to pound until 1/4-inch thick.\n2 Blanch the basil: Dip each basil (or other bitter green) leaf in boiling water, drain and set aside.\n3 Mix walnuts into Boursin or cheese mixture: If you are not starting with Boursin herbed cheese, make your own by mixing together the Herbed Cheese ingredients mentioned above. Mix the walnuts into the cheese mixture, set aside.\n4 Layer chicken with cheese and basil, roll up: Lay the chicken breasts flat, season each side with salt and pepper. Spread the cheese-walnut mixture over each breast, covering the surface of the breasts. Layer on the basil leaves. Starting at the shortest end of the chicken breast, roll up as tightly as possible and tuck in the ends to form a neat roll. Secure each breast with 2 toothpicks.\n5 Dredge in flour, egg, and breadcrumbs: Put flour, beaten egg, and breadcrumbs combined with the Parmesan cheese on to 3 separate flat dishes. Dredge each chicken breast roll first in the flour, then the egg, and finally the Parmesan bread crumbs. (Skip this step if you are going low carb and/or gluten-free.)\n6 Bake: Transfer chicken breasts to a greased baking dish, seam side down. Bake at 350\xc2\xb0F for 40-50 minutes, depending on the size of the breast, until the internal temperature is 165\xc2\xb0F, the juices run clear, and the chicken is slightly browned.\nLet rest for 5 minutes before serving.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nBlackberry Frozen Yogurt Recipe\nYield: Makes a little more than a quart\nThe berries release a lot of water when cooked, which is why I add cream to the mix. The additional fat helps keep the frozen yogurt from getting too icy. The brandy will help the frozen yogurt from getting too icy too, but you can leave it out if you want.\nINGREDIENTS\n3-4 cups blackberries or boysenberries (fresh or frozen)\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n1 cup sugar\n2 cardamom pods, crushed\n1/4 teaspoon cinnamon\n2 cups whole milk yogurt\n2 Tbsp heavy whipping cream\n2 Tbsp brandy (optional)\nMETHOD\n1 Simmer blackberries, sugar, zest, spices: Place blackberries, lemon zest, cardamom, cinnamon, and sugar in a saucepan. Bring to a simmer, stirring to help break up the berries and release their juice. Simmer for 10 minutes, then remove from heat to cool for 15 minutes.\n2 Push berry mixture through sieve: Place a sieve over a bowl. Push the berries through the sieve to capture the concentrated syrup below. Use the back of a spoon or a rubber spatula to help press the berries against the side of the sieve. Discard the berries in the sieve, save the syrup.\n3 Stir in yogurt and cream, then chill: Stir the yogurt and cream into the berry syrup. Cover with plastic wrap and chill for several hours.\n4 Add brandy, process in ice cream maker: Right before processing in your ice cream maker, add the brandy if using.

Add the brisket and spread the BBQ sauce mixture generously over meat. Wrap the brisket in the aluminum foil so it's well sealed, like a package.\nBake for 3 hours for a 3 pound roast and 1 more hour for every additional pound of meat.\nOR, instead of foil, you can use an oven roasting bag:\nOven roasting bag method: Place the barbecue sauce and the brisket in an oven roasting bag. Sprinkle a teaspoon of flour into the bag. Poke a couple small holes in the bag. Place the bag in a roasting pan. You may find that the cooking time is faster with this method, or you can reduce the oven temperature to 275\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Let the brisket rest: Remove from oven and let rest in the foil for 30 minutes before serving.\n5 Slice across the grain of the meat: The easiest way to serve the roast is to first cut it in half along the grain of the meat (poke the meat with the tip of a knife or tines of a fork to see which way the grain or lines of the muscles are going if you can't see it from the surface).\nThen make 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick cuts across the grain to serve.

Season ribs to taste with the salt and pepper. Heat oil in a large, heavy bottomed ovenproof pan over high heat. Add ribs and brown on all sides. Work in batches if you need to so that the ribs don't get crowded (this will help with browning).\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 vegetables: Transfer ribs to a plate. Pour off the excess fat (do not put down the drain or you will clog your sink!). Add the onions, celery, and carrots to the pan and saut\xc3\xa9, stirring often, until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the vegetables from the pan, set aside.\n3 Deglaze pan with wine, then reduce sauce: Add the wine to the pan, deglazing the pan, scraping off any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Reduce the wine by three-quarters until thick and slightly syrupy, about 15 minutes on high heat.\n4 Braise ribs in oven: Return the ribs to the pan, add the veal stock and enough water to cover the ribs.

Pat dry with paper towels. Season generously with the salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat.\nWhen the oil is hot, shimmering but not smoking, add the roast and cook, turning it a few times, until it is nicely browned on all sides, 10-12 minutes.\nTransfer the meat to a platter.\n2 Add vegetables: Reduce the heat to medium. Add the carrot, celery, and onion. Cook, stirring occasionally until the vegetables are golden brown and begin to stick to the bottom of the pan, 10-12 minutes.\nAdd the garlic, parsley, and sage, and stir until the herbs are lightly colored and fragrant, about 1 minute.\n3 Deglaze the pan with wine, return meat to the pan: Add 1 cup of the wine and stir quickly, lifting up the richly browned caramelized vegetables that stick to the bottom of the pan.\nWhen the wine is almost all evaporated and thickly coats the vegetables, return the meat to the pan and turn it over a few times to coat it with the savory base.\n4 Add remaining ingredients, simmer until tender: Raise the heat to high, adding the remaining wine, the bay leaf, and the tomatoes, and bring to a boil. Cover the pot, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, turning and basting the meat every half hour or so, until the meat is very tender and flakes away when pierced with a fork, 3-4 hours.\n5 Turn off the heat and let the roast sit in its juices for an hour. (You can also put the pot into a 300\xc2\xb0F oven and turn the roast every hour.)\n6 Remove meat, reduce sauce: Remove the meat from the pot and place it on a cutting board, covered loosely with aluminum foil. If the sauce is too thin, bring it to a fast boil and reduce it until it has a medium-thick consistency. Taste and adjust seasoning.\n7 Cut the meat into thick slices (it will probably fall apart), and place on warm serving dishes. Spoon the sauce over the meat and serve hot.

b"Print\nBeef Roast Braised in Red Wine Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 3 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6\nINGREDIENTS\n1 (3 1/2 pound) chuck roast, boneless\nSalt and ground black pepper\n4 oz pancetta, cut into 1/4-inch cubes\n2 medium onions, chopped medium (about 2 cups)\n2 medium carrots, chopped medium (about 1 cup)\n2 ribs celery, chopped medium (1 cup)\n1 Tbsp tomato paste\n3 medium cloves garlic, minced or pressed through garlic press (about 1 tablespoon)\n1 (750 ml) bottle Zinfandel wine (can substitute Cabernet Sauvignon, or other full bodied red wine)\n1 can (14 1/2 ounces) diced tomatoes, drained\n1 Tbsp chopped fresh oregano\n1 teaspoon minced fresh rosemary\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Salt the roast and let sit at room temp while you prep the vegetables: If your roast is very fatty, trim some of the fat. But it is important to keep some fat, as this will keep the roast moist while braising. In many supermarkets chuck roasts will already be properly trimmed.\nSalt the roast well and set aside at room temperature while you prepare all the other vegetables.\n2 Render fat and crisp the pancetta: Pour a little water into a Dutch oven or other heavy, lidded pot. Set the pot over medium heat and add the diced pancetta. As soon as the water begins to simmer, lower the heat to medium-low and slowly crisp up the pancetta; the water allows some of the fat in the pork to render out without charring the pancetta.\nWhen the pancetta is crispy and brown, remove it with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n3 Brown the roast on all sides: Preheat the oven to 300\xc2\xb0F. Pat the beef roast dry with a paper towel, increase the heat to medium and brown all sides in the pot.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 the chopped vegetables: Once the meat has browned remove it to a bowl and add the onions, carrot and celery. Sprinkle salt over the vegetables while they cook. Increase the heat to medium-high and saut\xc3\xa9 for 2-3 minutes.\nAdd the tomato paste and stir well, saut\xc3\xa9 for another 1-2 minutes. Add the garlic and cook a minute more.\n5 Add tomatoes, pancetta, herbs, wine, and the roast. Cover and cook: Increase the heat to high and add the tomatoes, the pancetta, herbs and red wine. Nestle the beef roast into the pot, cover, place in the 300\xc2\xb0F oven and cook for 3 hours. At the halfway point, use tongs to turn the beef roast over.\n6 Strain and reduce the sauce: Remove the pot from oven and transfer beef to a large bowl; tent with foil to keep warm. Allow the liquid to settle in the pot for a few minutes, if you'd like, skim off some of the fat with a wide shallow spoon. If you have an immersion blender, use it to blend the contents of the pot. If you don't, use a whisk to help break down the vegetables.\nBoil the sauce until it is reduced to about 3 1/2 cups. Strain liquid through large fine-mesh strainer, pressing on solids with spatula to extract as much liquid as possible; you should have a couple cups strained sauce.\nAdd any accumulated juices from the bowl you have the beef in. Boil the sauce again until it has reduced to 1 1/2 cups. Season sauce to taste with salt and pepper.\n7 Slice the meat and serve with the sauce: Cut the meat into roughly 1/2-inch-thick slices and pour the sauce over them. Serve with a bold red wine and crusty bread or mashed potatoes.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

The reason to do it in the oven is to produce a crispy skin.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 tablespoons butter\n2 cooking apples (Fuji or Jonagold are perfect for this dish, do NOT use a red delicious), cored and sliced into wedges (you can peel or not)\nFlour for dredging\n4 whole chicken legs (with thighs)\nSalt\n1 large onion, peeled, sliced lengthwise (root to top) into wedges\n1/2 cup (120 ml) brandy (apple brandy or Calvados if you have it)\n2 cups (475 ml) apple cider (the cloudy type)\n1 teaspoon dried thyme\n1/2 cup cream\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Sprinkle chicken with salt: Sprinkle salt over the chicken pieces and let sit for 20 minutes at room temperature while you prep the other ingredients and saut\xc3\xa9 the apples in the next step.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 apple slices: Preheat the oven to 375\xc2\xb0F (190\xc2\xb0C). Heat 2 Tbsp of the butter in a large, oven-proof saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium heat. Add the apple slices and saut\xc3\xa9 until they turn a little brown around the edges, turning occasionally.\nSprinkle the apple slices with a little salt. Remove from pan and aside on paper towels to drain.\n3 Dredge chicken in flour, brown in pan: Dredge the chicken in flour and place the pieces in the saut\xc3\xa9 pan, skin side down. Add the remaining 2 Tbsp of butter.\nFry until golden, about 3-5 minutes on medium to medium-high heat on each side. Remove from pan and set aside.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 onion slices: Add the onions and increase the heat to medium-high. Spread the onion slices out in an even layer to cover the pan. As the onions cook they will release moisture that will help deglaze the pan of the browned bits from the chicken.\nSaut\xc3\xa9 the onions, stirring occasionally, until they just being to brown, about 5-8 minutes.\n5 Deglaze pan with brandy: Add the brandy to the pan. Using a wooden spoon, scrape any remaining browned bits off the bottom of the pan.\n6 Add apple cider: Let the brandy boil until it has reduced by about half. Add the apple cider and bring it to a boil. Sprinkle in the thyme. Add just a pinch of salt to the cider.\n7 Place chicken on onions, and roast in oven: Arrange the chicken legs in the pan so the skin faces up and is not submerged by the cider-brandy mixture. Place in the oven and cook at 375\xc2\xb0F (190\xc2\xb0C), uncovered, for 30 minutes.\n\n8 Remove chicken, add apples, reduce sauce: Remove the pan from the oven. (Watch out for the hot handle! I like to run an ice cube over the handle as soon as I remove the pan, to help bring the handle temp down quickly and prevent a bad burn if I forget the handle is hot.) Remove the chicken pieces from the pan and set aside.\nPlace the pan back on a stovetop burner on high heat. Add the apples and boil down the sauce by half.\n9 Add cream, salt, pepper: When the sauce reduces to the point where it's a little syrupy, add the cream and turn down the heat. Taste for salt and add some if needed.\nTo serve, spoon some apples and onions on the plate, top with sauce and a piece of chicken.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nSpiced Mulled Wine Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: 6 servings\nThe key to mulled wine is to warm the wine without boiling it, which would cook off the alcohol. When your kitchen smells so achingly good that you're dying to try a cup of this masterpiece, you'll know it's done.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 orange\n15 whole cloves\n1 bottle red wine (inexpensive Cabernet or Malbec)\n1/4 cup sugar (turbinado is nice)\n3 cinnamon sticks\n2 teaspoons ground ginger\n1/4 cup brandy\nSpecial equipment:\nLarge pot or slow cooker\nMETHOD\n1 Stud the cloves into the orange, then cut the orange: Push the cloves into the orange (see this picture for reference), then cut the orange into half circles. (Studding the cloves into the orange means you won't have to worry about floating cloves in your drink.)\nAlternatively, cut the orange into half circles and add it and the cloves to the wine separately.\n2 Add ingredients to the pot: Add all the ingredients to a pot or a slow cooker.\n3 Heat the wine: On the stovetop, simmer the wine for 20\xe2\x80\x9325 minutes over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally to mix ingredients and dissolve sugar. If you're using a slow cooker, heat the wine on low heat for 1 1/2 hours or on high for 45 minutes, until warm.\nWhen the mulled wine smells amazing, tastes spicy, and is hot (but not boiling), it's done.

b"Print\nBoozy Chai-Spiced Apple Cider Punch Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesYield: 7 cups or approximately 10 servings, enough to fill an average-sized pitcher\nThis punch is on the tart side. To make it sweeter, start with two tablespoons honey or simple syrup and add more until you reach your desired sweetness.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to fill a large punch bowl or countertop drink dispenser, I recommend doubling or even tripling the recipe.\nThe punch can be made a day or so ahead of time and kept it in the fridge until needed. Hold off on garnishing until you're ready to serve since the apples can get a bit dodgy.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 bags chai tea or 3 teaspoons loose chai (I like Republic of Tea)\n1 1/2 cups water\n2 cups brandy\n1 1/2 cups apple cider\n3/4 cups fresh squeezed lemon juice\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\nHoney or simple syrup, as needed\nLemon wheels or clove-studded apple slices, for garnish\nMETHOD\n1 Make the tea: Add 2 tea bags or 3 teaspoons loose chai tea to 1 1/2 cups of water. Steep for 5 minutes. Let cool to room temperature.\n2 Combine all ingredients: Add the cooled brewed tea, brandy, apple cider, lemon juice, and vanilla extract to a pitcher. Add several handfuls of ice cubes or one large ice mold. Stir, and then garnish with lemon wheels and apple slices studded with cloves.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nGrilled Branzino with Rosemary Vinaigrette Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 12 minutesYield: Serves 2\nIf branzino is not available, try this with walleye, Pacific rock cod, or a large Atlantic black seabass.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons minced onion\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard\n1 teaspoon salt\n3 tablespoons white wine vinegar\n1 large garlic clove, chopped\n1 heaping tablespoon of minced fresh rosemary\n1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil\n1 whole branzino\nOlive oil\nSalt, preferably sea salt\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the rosemary vinaigrette: Put the minced onion, mustard, salt, vinegar, garlic and rosemary into a blender and pulse it for about 30 seconds. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the blender and pur\xc3\xa9e it again for 10-20 seconds. Scrape the sides down again.\nTurn the blender on low and take the removable cap off the lid. Hold your hand over the hole, as it might spit a little. Pour the olive oil in slowly and put the cap back on.\nTurn the blender off and scrape the sides down one more time. Turn the blender back on low, then high for 60 seconds.\n2 Prepare the fish: Rinse the fish under cold water. Now make sure its gills and scales are all removed; your fishmonger is not always so diligent about this task, and no one wants a scale on his plate. Gills can impart a bitter taste to the fish, so they need to go, too.\n3 Make cuts on the sides of the fish: Use a very sharp knife and make several slashes on the sides of the fish, maybe every inch or so. Make the cuts at an angle to the side of the fish, and slice down until you feel the spine. Do not sever the spine, however. These cuts will help the fish cook faster. Rub olive oil all over the fish and set it aside.\n4 Prepare the grill for high, direct heat. Scrape down the grates well and close the lid. Salt the fish well. Now grab a paper towel, a set of tongs, and some cheap vegetable oil. Bring all of this out to the grill.\nFold the paper towel over several times, moisten it with the vegetable oil, and hold it with tongs to wipe down the grill grates.\n5 Grill the fish: Lay the fish down on the grill and close the lid. Let this cook for 5 minutes without touching it.\nOpen the lid and, using tongs, gently see if you can lift the fish off the grates cleanly. Don\xe2\x80\x99t actually do this, but check for sticky spots. If you have some, get a metal spatula. Use the spatula to dislodge the fish from the sticky spots.\nUsing tongs in one hand, and the spatula in another, gently flip the fish over. If it sticks, no biggie. It happens sometimes.\n    7  Finish grilling the fish: Once the fish has been flipped, let it cook another 3-5 minutes. Again, test for sticky spots with the tongs and spatula. Dislodge them gently and gently lift the fish onto a plate.\nIf the fish is too long or seems like it might break in half, use two metal spatulas instead of the tongs-and-spatula set-up.\n8 Drizzle the vinaigrette over the fish and serve at once. Goes well with crusty bread and a glass of pilsner beer or white wine.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Print\nSt. Lucia Saffron Buns Recipe\nPrep time: 2 hours, 30 minutesCook time: 12 minutesYield: Makes 12 to 14 buns\nThis recipe makes 12 to 14 good sized buns. You can easily double the recipe. Note the cardamom is optional. I\'ve made these buns with and without a little cardamom and I  prefer them with. I\'m guessing it\'s more traditional without.\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4 cup milk (175 ml)\n1/2 teaspoon saffron threads\n1 teaspoon plus 1/4 cup (50 g) white, granulated sugar\nOne 1/4-ounce packet active dry yeast (check the expiration date on the package to make sure it\'s still good!)\n3 1/2 to 4 cups (490 g to 570 g) all purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\nThe seeds from 3 cardamom pods, ground (optional)\n1/4 cup (1/2 stick, 4 Tbsp, 56 g) unsalted butter, softened\n1/4 cup of sour cream (or quark if available)\n2 large eggs\nRaisins\nGlaze\n1 egg, beaten\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat milk, saffron, sugar: In a small pot, heat the milk, saffron, and 1 teaspoon of sugar together until the milk is steamy. Remove from heat and stir to dissolve the sugar. Let cool until about 115\xc2\xb0F, or warm to the touch, but not hot.\n2 Sprinkle the yeast over the warm saffron-infused milk and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes until foamy.\n3 Whisk flour, sugar, salt, cardamom: In the bowl of a stand-up mixer* whisk together 3 1/2cups (490 g) of the flour, remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, salt and ground cardamom (if using).\n*You can make this recipe without a mixer, for me it\'s just a bit easier with one.\n4 Make a well in the center of the flour and add the yeast milk saffron mixture, the eggs, the butter, and the sour cream. Mix the ingredients until well incorporated.\n5 Knead the dough: Switch to the dough hook of your mixer (if using, otherwise knead by hand). On low speed start to knead the dough. Slowly add additional flour, a tablespoon at a time, kneading to incorporate after each addition. Do this until the dough is still a little sticky to the touch, but does not completely stick to your hands when you handle it.\n6 Let dough rise: Shape the dough into a ball and place in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. (Note at this point you can make ahead and refrigerate overnight if you wish.)\nLet sit in a warm place for 1 to 2 hours, until the dough has doubled in size. (One way to tell that the dough is ready is that you poke your finger in it and it takes quite a bit of time for the indentation left by your finger to go away.)\n7 Form dough into S shapes: When the dough has doubled in size, gently press it down and knead it a couple of times. Break off a piece and form it into a ball about 2 inches wide (60 to 70 grams if you are weighing). Roll the ball out into a snake, about 14 inches long.\nThen Curl the ends in opposite directions, forming an "S" with spirals at each end. Place on a lined baking sheet and repeat with the rest of the dough.\n8 Let sit for second rise:  Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot until the dough shapes double in size, 30 minutes to an hour.\n9 Brush with egg wash, place raisins on buns: Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C). Using a pastry brush, brush some beaten egg over the tops and sides of the uncooked buns. Place raisins in the centers of the "S" spirals.\n10 Bake: Place in the oven and bake at400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C) for about 10 to 11 minutes (turning halfway through cooking to ensure even browning), until the buns are golden brown.\nRemove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before eating.\nHello!

b"Print\nSouthern Cornbread Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Makes 8 servings\nWhite cornmeal is used in most Southern cornbreads, but we could not find any here in California, so we used yellow cornmeal. If you can find white cornmeal, by all means use it.\nThe egg is optional, though without it the cornbread will be very crumbly.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon bacon drippings\n2 cups cornmeal OR 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1/2 cup flour\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon sugar (optional)\n1 large egg (optional)\n1 1/4 cups buttermilk\n6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat pan with bacon drippings: Put the bacon drippings in a 9 or 10-inch well-seasoned cast iron skillet and put the skillet into the oven. Then preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F with the skillet inside. (If you don't have an iron skillet, you can use an uncovered Dutch oven or a metal cake pan.)\n2 Make the batter: Whisk together all the dry ingredients (cornmeal, baking soda, salt, sugar if using) in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the egg (if using) and buttermilk until combined, then mix that into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir in the melted butter.\n3 Pour batter into hot skillet and bake: When the oven is hot, take out the skillet (carefully, as the handle will be hot!). Add the cornbread batter and make sure it is evenly distributed in the skillet.\nBake at 400\xc2\xb0F for about 20 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.\n4 Rest bread in skillet, then serve: Let the bread rest for 10 to 30 minutes in the skillet before cutting it into wedges and serving.\nTo store, let the cornbread cool, then remove from pan and wrap in plastic wrap or transfer to an airtight container. Store at room temp for 2 to 3 days\nTo avoid burning your hand because you've forgotten the pan is hot, I recommend placing a pot holder on the pan's handle while the cornbread is resting, or cooling the handle down a bit with an ice cube.\nHello!

b"Print\nCaraway Soda Bread Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Makes one loaf\nINGREDIENTS\n3 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour (1 pound)\n1 Tbsp sugar\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n2 teaspoons caraway seeds\n4 Tbsp butter (1/2 stick) room temp\n1 1/2 cups buttermilk*\n*If necessary, you can substitute buttermilk with a half cup of plain yogurt mixed in with a cup of plain milk and a tablespoon of white vinegar.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 450\xc2\xb0F. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and caraway seeds.\n2 Using your fingers (or a fork) work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.\n3 Make a well in the center of the flour. Pour the buttermilk into the center and using either your hands or a wooden spoon, fold the flour over the buttermilk and gently mix until just combined.\nThe dough should be neither too wet or too dry, so if it is a little too dry to work with, add a little more buttermilk. If too wet, add a little more flour. Roughly shape into a ball and place on a floured surface. Knead just a few times to shape it into a round loaf. Do not over-knead or the bread will be tough.\n4 Place dough loaf onto a lightly greased baking sheet (or cast iron pan). Make 1 1/2-inch deep cuts, forming a cross, from side to side on the loaf. The scoring helps the heat get to the center of the loaf while cooking.\n5 Place in oven, cook for 15 minutes at 450\xc2\xb0F, then lower the heat to 400\xc2\xb0F and cook for 25 more minutes. One way to test for doneness is to take it out of the oven, turn it over and knock on the bottom. If it sounds hollow, it's done. You can also use a skewer inserted into the center.\nLet bread sit on the baking sheet for 5-10 minutes to cool. Then remove it to a rack to cool a little bit longer. I think the bread is best when it is still warm and just baked. Quick breads like this, which rely on baking soda for leavening, are generally best eaten soon after they're baked.\nHello!

You will put your dough in this bowl to let it rise. Set the bowl aside.\n2 Prepare the dough: In a Pyrex liquid measuring cup or a small mixing bowl, combine the lukewarm milk, sugar, and active dry yeast. The milk should be just warm to the touch. If it\xe2\x80\x99s too hot you can kill the yeast. Let it sit for 5 minutes.\nIn another large mixing bowl, whisk the flour and salt together. Add yogurt, oil and milk-yeast mixture. Use a wooden spoon or your hands to combine the dough. The dough should be soft and sticky at this point.\n3 Knead the dough: Dust your countertop with flour. Transfer the dough to the counter. Knead together until a soft dough forms, about 5 minutes. If the dough feels dry and is too tough to knead, add about 1-2 tablespoons of water, a little bit at a time, until the dough is easier to work with.\n4 Let the dough rise: Transfer the dough to the greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Place in a dark, warm, dry place. I place it in my oven (it\xe2\x80\x99s not on) to let it rise, but your countertop is fine. Let the dough rise for 3-4 hours or until it more than doubles in size.\n5 Punch down the dough and let it rise again: Punch the risen dough down. Knead for another minute. Return the dough to the bowl, cover it again and let it rise for another 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n6 Divide the dough: Dust your countertop with flour. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead it for another minute or two until its smooth. Divide the dough into 16 smaller balls of equal size (about 2 ounces each).\nUsing a rolling pin, roll the balls into a teardrop shape. About 2-3 inches wide, 6-7 inches long, and about 1/8 inch thick. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be perfectly uniform.\n7 Cook the naan: If using herbs or spices, sprinkle one side of the bread with those now. Brush the other side with water. Set a medium-sized heavy pan or cast iron skillet with a lid over medium-high heat.\nCheck the heat of the pan by flicking water on it. If it evaporates on contact, it\xe2\x80\x99s ready. Once the pan is hot, place the naan wet side down into the skillet.\nCover it with a lid. Let it cook for about 30 seconds or until you see bubbles on it. Flip the naan, brush it with butter or ghee, and cook it uncovered for another 10 seconds. Serve it hot.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Feel free to dress it up a bit with herbs or spices of your choice.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 large egg*\n1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil\n2/3 cup milk\n1 1/2 cups (170 grams) tapioca flour\n1/2 cup (packed, about 66 grams) grated cheese, your preference, we get good results with feta cheese (no need to grate), or fresh farmer's cheese (if using fresh farmer's cheese, you may want to add another 1/2 teaspoon of salt)\n1 teaspoon of salt (or more to taste)\n*It helps when baking with eggs to start with eggs at room temperature. If you don't plan ahead (that would be me, usually) you can put the egg in a bowl of warm water for a few minutes to gently take off the chill of the fridge.\nSpecial equipment:\nOne 24-well or or two 12-well mini muffin tins. Mini muffin tins are about half the size of a regular muffin pan. The muffin openings are about 1-inch deep, and 1 3/4 inch wide at the top.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Pre-heat oven, prepare mini-muffin tin: Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. Spread a small amount olive oil around the insides of each well of a mini-muffin tin.\n2 Blend ingredients: Put all of the ingredients into a blender and pulse until smooth. You may need to use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the blender so that everything gets blended well. At this point you can store the batter in the refrigerator for up to a week.\n3 Pour into mini-muffin tin: Pour batter into prepared mini-muffin tin, not quite to the top; leave about 1/8 inch from the top.\n4 Bake: Bake at 400\xc2\xb0F in the oven for 15-20 minutes, until all puffy and nicely browned. Remove from oven and let cool on a rack for a few minutes.\nEat while warm or save to reheat later.\nNote that Brazilian cheese bread is very chewy, a lot like Japanese mochi.\nHello!

b"Print\nSwedish Coffee Bread (Tea Ring) Recipe\nYield: Makes 2 wreaths\nIt's best to start with whole cardamom pods - peel the pods (helps to crush them first) to release the seeds. Crush the seeds with a mortar and pestle or use a rolling pin to grind them.\nINGREDIENTS\nBread:\n1 cup whole milk\n1/2 cup (100g) white sugar\n1/2 cup (4 oz) butter\n2-pkg active yeast dissolved in 1/4 cup warm water\nAbout 4 cups (560g) all-purpose flour\n1 large egg\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon ground cardamom\nFilling:\n2 tablespoons melted butter\n1/4 cup (54g)  brown sugar, packed\n1 tablespoon white sugar\n2 teaspoons cinnamon\n1 cup golden raisins (optional)\n1/2 cup slivered almonds (optional)\n1/4 cup almond paste (optional)\nEgg glaze:\n2 egg yolks\n2 tablespoon cream\nSugar glaze:\n1 cup (115g) powdered sugar\n1 tablespoon water\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nMake the Dough:\n1 Put milk into a small saucepan and heat on medium heat until steamy (but not boiling). Remove from heat. Stir in the butter and sugar until the butter has melted and the sugar dissolved. Pour into a mixing bowl. Mix in yeast mixture and egg.\n2 Mix in salt and cardamom. Slowly add in 2 cups of the flour. After the first two cups of flour gradually add more flour until a soft dough starts to form a ball and pull away from the sides of the bowl.\n3 Turn out onto a floured surface and knead dough for 7 to 10 minutes until smooth, OR use a dough hook in a stand-up mixer and knead the dough that way for 7 to 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed to keep the dough from being too sticky. Note that the dough should remain soft, so take care not to add too much flour.\nLet the Dough Rise:\n4 Place the dough in an oiled bowl, covered with a clean tea-towel or with plastic wrap. Let rise for an hour or until the dough has doubled in size.\nAt this point you can make a simple braided bread if you want (2 loaves), by punching the dough down, dividing the dough in half, and then dividing each half into three equal parts, rolling the dough pieces into ropes, braiding them, and tucking the ends under.\nOr you can get more fancy, which is what we've done here, with a filling, and forming the dough into a wreath shape. The following directions are for the wreath form.\nMake the Wreath Form:\n5 Press the dough down to deflate it a bit. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Take one part (saving the other for wreath number 2) and use your fingers to spread it into a 8-inch by 16-inch rectangle on a lightly floured, clean, flat surface.\nIf you are having difficulty getting the dough to keep its shape, just do what you can and let it sit for 5 minutes before trying again. Like pizza dough, the dough needs time to relax while you are forming it.\nBrush the dough with melted butter, leaving at least a half inch border on the edges so the dough will stick together when rolled. Mix together the brown and white sugar and the cinnamon and sprinkle the dough with half of the mixture (saving the other half for the second batch of dough).\nSprinkle on more fillings, as you like, such as raisins, slivered almonds, or almond paste. You could even sprinkle on some cream cheese for a creamier filling.\n6 Carefully roll the dough up lengthwise, with the seam on the bottom. Carefully transfer to a greased baking sheet. Form a circle with the dough on the baking sheet, connecting the ends together.\n7 Using scissors, cut most of the way through the dough, cutting on a slant. Work your way around the dough circle. After each cut, pull out the dough segment either to the right or to the left, alternating as you go around the circle. The dough circle will look like a wreath when you are done.\nRepeat steps 5, 7, and 8 with the rest of the dough, to form a second wreath.\nThe Second Rise:\n8 Cover lightly with plastic wrap and set in a warm area for a second rise. Let rise for about 40 minutes to an hour; the dough should again puff up in size.\nBake:\n9 Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Whisk together the egg yolks and cream. Use a pastry brush to brush over the dough. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes. After the first 15 minutes of baking, if the top is getting well browned, tent with some aluminum foil.\n10 Remove from oven and let cool completely. Whisk together powdered sugar and water to create a final glaze (optional). Add more water if the glaze is too thick to drizzle, add more powdered sugar if the glaze is too runny. Drizzle the glaze in a back and forth motion over the pastry.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"
b"Print\nChocolate Zucchini Bread Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 10 minutesYield: Makes 2 loaves\nThis recipe makes 2 loaves; you can easily divide the recipe in half to make just one loaf.\nThe recipe calls for 4 cups of grated zucchini, which will yield particularly moist loaves. I've made it with 3 cups, which was also very good, just not as sublime as with 4 cups.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 cups grated zucchini (from about a pound and a half of zucchini)\n2 1/2 cups all purpose flour\n1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa (use natural unsweetened cocoa, NOT Dutch processed)\n2 teaspoons baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n1 1/2 cups granulated white sugar\n2 eggs\n3/4 cup unsalted butter (12 Tbsp or 1 1/2 sticks), melted\n1/2 teaspoon instant coffee granules\n1/2 teaspoon almond extract\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Drain excess moisture from grated zucchini: Place the freshly grated zucchini in a sieve over a bowl to catch any excess moisture as it drains, while you work on prepping the other ingredients and preparing the recipe.\nIf for some reason your zucchini is on the dry side, hydrate the shredded zucchini by soaking it in water first, and then place in sieve.\n2 Preheat oven, prepare loaf pans: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F, with a rack in the middle. Grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans with baking spray or butter.\n3 Whisk together flour, cocoa, baking soda, salt, cinnamon: Vigorously whisk together the flour, unsweetened cocoa, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon in a large bowl. Whisk until there are no more clumps and the ingredients are well combined.\n4 Beat sugar and eggs, add melted butter, instant coffee granules, almond extract: In a separate large bowl, beat together the sugar and eggs until smooth, about a minute. You can do this with an electric mixer on medium speed, or by hand with a wooden spoon. (I'm lazy and use a mixer but it's easy enough to do by hand.)\nAdd the melted butter, instant coffee granules, and almond extract and beat until smooth.\n5 Stir zucchini into sugar egg mixture, add flour mixture: Mix the shredded zucchini into the sugar egg mixture.\nAdd the flour to the zucchini mixture in 3 additions, stirring to combine after each addition.\n6 Divide batter into pans and bake: Work quickly, and divide the batter between the two prepared loaf pans. (Work quickly because once the dry ingredients have mixed with the wet ingredients, the leavening has begun.)\nPlace into the oven. Bake for 50 minutes at 350\xc2\xb0F, or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean and easily.\n7 Cool: Remove to a rack. Let cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then run a blunt knife around the edges to separate the bread from the pan. Remove from the loaf pans and let cool completely on a rack.\nNote that if you try to slice the chocolate zucchini bread before it has completely cooled, it will be rather crumbly. It's also easiest to slice with a bread knife.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"

It adds a lot to the flavor of the finished bread.\nINGREDIENTS\nButter for greasing loaf pans or coffee cans\n1/2 cup (heaping) all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup (heaping) rye flour\n1/2 cup (heaping) finely ground corn meal (must be finely ground)\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon allspice\n1/2 cup molasses (any kind)\n1 cup buttermilk\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract (optional)\n1/2 cup raisins (optional)\nOne metal 6-inch tall by 4-inch diameter coffee can, or a 4x8 loaf pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare for either stovetop or oven methods: You can either make the bread on the stovetop with a coffee can, or you can make it in the oven with a coffee can or loaf pan.\nStovetop: If you are using the stovetop method, set the steamer rack inside a tall stockpot and fill the pot with enough water to come 1/3 of the way up the sides of your coffee can. Turn the burner on to medium as you work.\nOven: If you are using the oven method, preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xb0F and bring a large pot of water to a boil.\n2 Grease pan: Grease a coffee can or small loaf pan with butter.\n3 Mix dry ingredients:  In a large bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, rye flour, corn meal, baking powder and soda, salt and allspice. Add the raisins if using.\n4 Mix wet ingredients, combine with dry: In another bowl, mix together the buttermilk and vanilla extract if using. Whisk in the molasses.\nPour the wet ingredients into the dry and stir well with a spoon.\n5 Pour batter into can or pan, cover with foil: Pour the batter into the coffee can or loaf pan taking care that the batter not reach higher than 2/3 up the sides of the container.\nCover the loaf pan or coffee can tightly with foil.\n6 Prepare steam environment on stovetop or oven:\nStovetop: If you are using the stovetop method, set the can in the pot on the steamer rack. Make sure there is enough water in the pot to come up 1/3 of the way up the sides of your coffee can or loaf pan. Cover the pot and turn the heat to high.\nOven: If you are using the oven method, find a high-sided roasting pan that can hold the coffee can or loaf pan. Pour the boiling water into the roasting pan until it reaches one third up the side of the coffee can or loaf pan. Put the roasting pan into the 325\xc2\xb0F oven.\n7 Steam the bread: Steam the bread on the stovetop or in the oven for at least 2 hours and 15 minutes.\nCheck to see if the bread is done by inserting a toothpick into it. If the toothpick comes out clean, you're ready. If not, re-cover the pan and cook for up to another 45 minutes.\n8 Allow bread to cool: Remove from the stovetop or oven and let cool for 10 minutes before putting on a rack. Let the bread cool for 1 hour before turning out of the container.\nSlice and eat plain, or toast in a little butter in a frying pan.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nCheesy Skillet Cornbread Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Makes 8 servings\nMake sure your baking powder is fresh. Baking powder over 6 months old tends to lose its leavening power.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup cornmeal\n1/2 cup flour\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n1 tablespoon sugar\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 cup shredded medium or sharp cheddar cheese\n1/4 cup chopped onion\n1 cup milk\n3 tablespoons bacon drippings (warmed to liquid), plus 1 teaspoon to grease the pan\n1 egg, beaten\n3/4 cup of cooked corn, either fresh, defrosted frozen corn, or drained from a can\nMETHOD\n1 Preheat pan in oven: Place a 9 or 10-inch cast iron pan in the oven and preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Make the batter: In a large bowl, whisk together the cornmeal, flour, baking powder, sugar, garlic powder, and salt. Add remaining ingredients, and stir until just combined.\n3 Grease hot pan, add batter: Carefully remove the hot pan from the oven (remember the handle is hot!). Place a teaspoon of bacon fat in the bottom of the hot pan and swirl it around until it is all melted and coating the bottom of the pan. Pour the batter from the mixing bowl into the pan. Remember to put a pot holder over the hot handle of the pan and return it to the oven.\n4 Bake: Bake at 350\xc2\xb0F for 40 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from oven and let the cornbread cool in the pan. Remember that the handle is hot and will stay hot for quite some time. I recommend rubbing an ice cube over the handle to cool it down, just to avoid someone burning their hand if they attempt to move the pan before it has cooled down enough.\nHello!

b"Print\nHomemade Potato Bread Recipe\nYield: Makes 2 loaves\nINGREDIENTS\n1 large russet potato (about a 12 oz potato)\n2 cups (475 ml) milk\n2 teaspoons salt\n1 teaspoon sugar\n2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n1 packet instant yeast (2 1/4 teaspoons)\n5 cups (680g) all purpose flour\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook, peel, mash the potato: You will need 6-8 ounces of mashed potato for this potato bread recipe. That's between 3/4 cup and one cup of mashed potatoes.\nThe easiest way to cook the potato is to poke it all over with the tines of a fork and microwave it 4 minutes on one side, 4 minutes on the other side, on high. Let it cool, then peel it, and mash it with a fork.\nOr, you can boil the potato. Peel the potato, cut it into large chunks, cover it with water in a pot, bring to a simmer, and cook for 10 minutes or so until a fork easily goes through the potatoes, drain, cool, and mash.\n2 Heat the milk, whisk in mashed potato: Put two cups of milk into a medium saucepan with the salt and sugar. Heat on medium heat until the milk starts to bubble at the edges, then remove from heat. Stir to dissolve the salt and sugar. Whisk in the olive oil and the mashed potato.\nPour into the mixing bowl of a standing mixer (or just a large bowl if you don't have a mixer), and let cool until it is still warm, but not hot, to the touch. (If the mixture is too hot, it will kill the yeast in the next step.)\n3 Add yeast and 2 cups of flour: Stir in the yeast. Stir in 2 cups (264 g) of the flour. Use a standing mixer such as a KitchenAid (recommended), attach the mixing paddle, and mix on medium high speed for 4 minutes. This will help break up any potato lumps and help incorporate the mashed potatoes into the dough.\n(If you are using a bread machine, put the milk potato mixture, the yeast, and all of the flour into the bread machine and knead for 8 minutes, skip the next step and proceed to step 5.)\n4 Add the remaining flour and knead: Swap out the mixing paddle for the dough hook on your mixer. Add the remaining 3 cups (416 g) of flour and mix on medium low speed for 8 minutes. The dough should be rather loose and a little tacky.\n5 Put dough into a large bowl, let dough rise: Rub the inside of a large bowl with some olive oil. Transfer the dough from the mixing bowl and put it into this large bowl (can use your mixing bowl if you clean it, and coat the inside with oil). Gently coat the top of the dough with a little olive oil.\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap or a dampened towel (to prevent the dough from drying out). Place in a warm spot for 2 hours or in the refrigerator overnight.\nThe dough should at least double in size. You'll know when it has risen sufficiently when you press into the top with your fingertip and the indentation remains for a while.\n6 Punch down the dough, place in loaf pans: Press down on the dough with your hand to deflate it. Turn it out onto a clean lightly floured surface and knead a couple of times. Cut the dough into two halves (a pastry scraper comes in handy for this).\nRub a little olive oil inside of two 8x4-inch loaf pans. Place a dough half in each and press the dough into the bottom of the pans.\n7 Let dough rise again: Coat the top of the loaves with a little olive oil. Cover the loaf pans with plastic wrap and put in a warm place for 45 minutes to an hour or longer, until the dough has doubled in size.\n8 Bake: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C). Remove the plastic wrap from the loaf pans and gently place the loaf pans in the oven in the middle rack. Bake for 35 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the internal temperature is between 190 and 200\xc2\xb0F.\nWhile the bread is still warm in the pan, use a dull dinner knife and run along the edge of the pan between the pan and the bread to loosen the bread from the pan. Turn out of the loaf pans on to a rack, let cool completely before slicing.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Print\nHomemade Rye Bread Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 40 minutesTotal Rising time: 2 to 2 1/2 hoursYield: Makes 2 loaves\nINGREDIENTS\n2 packages active dry yeast (4 1/2 teaspoons or 16 grams)\n2 1/2 cups warm water (just barely warm to the touch)\n2/3 cup molasses (regular unsulphured; not blackstrap)\n2 tablespoons caraway seeds (optional)\n1 tablespoon salt\n1/4 cup vegetable oil\n1/4 cup cocoa powder (unsweetened)\n2 cups rye flour\n5 cups bread flour\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Dissolve the yeast: Dissolve the yeast in the warm water with the molasses. Put yeast mixture into a large metal bowl.\n2 Make the dough: Add the caraway seeds, salt, vegetable oil, cocoa powder, 2 cups of rye flour and then 2 cups of bread flour, mixing into the yeast mixture after each addition with a wooden spoon.\nAdd more bread flour, a cup at a time, until the dough is not so sticky and it is too hard to mix it with the wooden spoon. At that point, spread a half cupful of flour onto a large, clean, flat surface and put the dough onto the surface.\n3 Knead the dough: Knead the dough by pressing down with the heel of your hand, stretching it, turning the dough a quarter-turn, pulling the dough back toward you and then pressing and stretching again. Knead additional bread flour into the dough until it reaches the right consistency. Knead for 5-7 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and elastic.\n4 Let the dough rise: Spread some vegetable oil around a large bowl and place the dough in it, turning it so it gets coated in the oil.\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp cloth. Let rise at room temperature until it has doubled in size, 1 to 1 1/2 hours.\n5 Divide the dough: Gently press down on the risen dough so some of its air is released. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface, knead the dough a few turns and then divide it by cutting it in half with a sharp knife.\n6 Shape the loaves: Shape each half into loaf. Place dough loafs into either oiled 8x4-inch bread loaf pans, or onto a flat baking sheet or peel that has been sprinkled with corn meal, depending if you want to cook the loaves in pans or directly on a baking stone. Cover with plastic or a damp cloth.\n7 Let the loaves rise: Let the bread rise again, this time not doubling in volume, but rising by about half of its volume, about 30 to 45 minutes, half as long as the first rising. The dough should be peeking over the top of the loaf pan if using a loaf pan.\n8 Heat the oven: If you are using a baking stone, place the stone in the oven. Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F for at least half an hour before baking.\n9 Bake the loaves: If baking on a stone and not in the pan, score the loaves a few times on the top of the dough right before putting it in the oven.\nPut loaves in the oven. If you have a mister, mist the dough with a little water the first 10 minutes of baking. Bake for 40-50 minutes, or until done. The bread should sound hollow when tapped.\nHello!

b"Print\nDinner Potato Rolls {Buttery & Fluffy Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 25 minutesInactive rising time: 2 hoursYield: 16 to 20 rolls\nIf you're not already making mashed potatoes for your meal, roast or boil one large (12 ounce) russet potato to use in this recipe.\nI usually make this recipe with unseasoned mashed potatoes that haven't been mixed with butter or dairy, but have also made them with leftover seasoned mashed potatoes. With seasoned mashed potatoes, you may end up needing to use a little extra flour.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the rolls:\n1/2 cup water, room temperature\n2 1/4 teaspoon (1 packet) active-dry or instant yeast\n1 teaspoon plus 1/3 cup sugar, divided\n1 cup mashed potatoes\n1/4 cup milk\n6 tablespoons regular salted butter, melted and cooled\n2 large eggs\n2 1/2 teaspoons minced fresh rosemary leaves\n1 1/2 teaspoon salt\n4 1/2 to 5 cups all-purpose flour\nFor honey butter topping:\n1/4 cup regular salted butter, room temperature\n2 tablespoon honey\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Proof the yeast: In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the water, the yeast, and 1 teaspoon of the sugar. Set aside for about 5 minutes, or until the mixture looks bubbly. If the mixture doesn't start to bubble, then your yeast has likely expired and it's best to start over with new yeast.\n2 Mix the dough: Add the remaining sugar, mashed potatoes, milk, butter, eggs, rosemary, and salt to the bowl with the yeast mixture and stir with a spatula until smooth. Add 4 1/2 cups of the flour and mix until you form a shaggy dough.\n3 Knead the dough: With a dough hook attachment (or on the counter, if kneading by hand) knead on medium-low for 5 to 7 minutes until the dough is smooth, forms a ball around the dough hook, and pulls away from the sides of the bowl (it's fine if the dough sticks to the bottom of the bowl). If the dough is still sticking to the sides after few minutes of kneading, add in a little more flour 2 tablespoons at a time.\n4 Let the dough rise: Place the dough in a lightly greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and place somewhere warm for about 1 hour, or until the dough doubles in size.\n5 Shape the dough into rolls: Line a 13x9-inch baking pan with parchment paper and lightly grease. Turn the dough the out onto lightly floured surface and cut into 16 to 20 equal pieces. Roll the dough into small balls, and place seam side down in the baking dish.\n6 Cover and let the rolls rise until puffed and nearly doubled in size, about 1 hour. About 15 minutes before the rolls are ready, heat the oven to 350F.\n7 Bake for the rolls for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the rolls are golden brown on top and register 200F on the inside when tested with an instant-read thermometer.\n8 Brush the rolls with honey butter: In a small dish, mix together 1/4 cup room temperature butter and 2 tablespoons honey until smooth. Brush tops of baked rolls with mixture, then sprinkle with salt. Allow to cool slightly before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nWhole Wheat Bread\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 40 minutesRise time: 1 hour, 30 minutesYield: 2 loaves\nIf you are lactose intolerant, it's fine to substitute water for the milk.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 1/2 cups warm 2% milk\n1 packet Active Dry Yeast (about 3 teaspoons)\n3 1/3 cups (395g) bread flour plus more for dusting\n3 1/3 cups (410g) whole wheat flour\n1 tablespoon Kosher salt\n2 1/2 tablespoons butter, plus more for brushing loaves\n2 1/2 tablespoons honey\nSpecial equipment:\nTwo 9x5-inch loaf pans (You can use 8.5x4.5-inch pans, but your loaves will be quite a bit taller.)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the pans: Butter a large bowl and two 9x5-inch loaf pans and set aside. (You can use 8.5x4.5-inch pans, but your loaves will be quite a bit taller.)\n2 Proof the yeast: Warm the 2 1/2 cups of milk in the microwave in 30 second bursts, stirring in between, just to take the chill off. The milk should feel tepid to the touch, NOT hot. (Hot milk will kill the yeast.)\nStir the yeast into to the warm milk and let it hang out for about 5 minutes. The yeast should mostly dissolve and you should see some small bubbles on the surface of the milk.\n3 Meanwhile, whisk together the dry ingredients and melt the butter: In a large bowl, whisk whole wheat flour, bread flour, and salt. Make a well in the center.\nIn a small, microwave-safe bowl, warm the butter in 30 second bursts in the microwave until just melted. Add honey. Let it cool until no longer hot.\n4 Mix the dough: Pour the milk and yeast mixture into well in the flour. Add the butter and honey mixture.\nStir with a wooden spoon until a shaggy dough forms. Most of the flour should be incorporated, but it\xe2\x80\x99s ok if you still have some loose flour in the bowl.\n5 Knead the dough: To knead by hand: Turn the dough and any loose flour onto a countertop and knead for 10 minutes. Start by bringing the dough together with your fingers then smooshing it with the heel of your hand. Pull the dough back over itself with your fingers, rotate the dough a quarter turn. Smoosh with the heel of your hand and repeat.\nAs you knead, the dough should feel soft, pliable, and a little tacky. Dust with additional bread flour as needed, 1 tablespoon at a time, if it sticks to the counter or your hands.\nTo knead in a stand mixer: In a stand mixer fit with a dough hook attachment, knead the dough on the lowest speed for 5 to 7 minutes.\nWhen finished kneading, the dough should be tacky but not sticky. Form the dough into a ball. It should be smooth on top, and feel elastic.\n6 Let the dough rise: Place the ball of dough into the buttered bowl. Use your fingers to gently spread a thin layer of softened butter on top of the dough ball.\nCover with plastic wrap or a clean dish towel and let it sit on the counter until it has just about doubled in size. This should take 45 to 60 minutes.\n7 Shape the loaves: Gently punch the dough down two or three times. Take the dough out of the bowl and form it into a ball. Divide the dough into equal halves.\nShape each half into a loaf: Gently flatten the dough with the tips of your fingers to form a puffy oval roughly the width of your baking pan. Starting from a short end, gently roll it up and pinch the seam closed. Roll it over so the seam-side is down and transfer to the prepared baking pan.\nRepeat with the second loaf.\n8 Let the loaves rise: Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Let rise for 45 to 60 minutes, or until the bread rises just above the lip of the pan.\nThe dough is ready for the oven once it has puffed up, but it maintains its structure. You should be able to press a fingertip gently onto the top of it, and the dimple should slowly fill back in.\n9 Halfway through this second rise, preheat your oven to 375-degrees. Melt additional butter for brushing over the tops of the loaves.\n10 Bake the loaves: Slash a shallow line down the center of the dough with serrated knife. Brush the tops with the melted butter. (The top layer of dough might bubble a little when you baste it with the warm butter. That\xe2\x80\x99s ok. Just pop the bubbles with your knife.)\nPlace the loaves in the oven and bake for approximately 40 minutes until loaves are golden brown, have risen, and make a hollow sound when the bottoms are tapped.\n11 Cool the loaves: When the loaves have finished baking, remove from oven and baste the tops with butter one more time.\nTurn the loaves out onto a wire rack and let cool. Do not let the bread cool in the loaf pans. If you do, the bread will get soggy.\n12 Store and enjoy! Once the bread has cooled, store it on the countertop in a plastic bag or a cloth bread bag.\nThe bread will stay fresh for 4 days, which isn\xe2\x80\x99t to say it goes bad by day 5, just that it will start to dry out a bit.

After the yeast has rested for 10 minutes and has begun to froth, pour it into the water-oil mixture.\n3 Add flour and rosemary: Whisk in 2 cups of flour (either the bread flour or the all purpose, at this stage it doesn't matter which) and the tablespoon of salt. Add the rosemary.\nCup by cup, whisk in the rest of the flour (both the bread flour and all-purpose). As the mixture goes from a batter to a thick dough, you'll want to switch from a whisk to a wooden spoon.\n4 Knead the dough: By the time you get to adding the last cup of flour, you will be able to work the dough with your hands. Begin to knead it in the bowl \xe2\x80\x93 try to incorporate all the flour stuck to the sides and bottom of the bowl as you begin kneading.\nOnce the bowl is pretty clean, turn the dough out onto a board and knead it well for 8 minutes. You might need some extra flour if the dough is sticky.\nNote that a KitchenAid mixer (or some other brand of upright electric mixer) works well for the mixing and kneading of the bread dough. About the time you add the last cup of flour you'll want to switch from the standard mixer attachment to the dough hook attachment.\nJust knead the dough using the dough hook on low speed for 8 minutes. If after a few minutes the dough is still a little sticky, add a little sprinkling of flour to it.\n5 First rise: In a large clean bowl, pour in about a tablespoon of oil and put the dough on top of it. Spread the oil all over the dough.\nCover the bowl with plastic wrap and set aside to rise (in a relatively warm spot or at room temp) for an hour and a half. It should just about double in size.\n6 Spread dough in baking pan: Spread a little olive oil in your baking pan or baking sheet (will make it easier to remove the bread). Place the dough in your baking pans or form it into free-form rounds on a baking sheet.\nThis recipe will make two nice-sized loaves or one big one and a little one. Cover the breads and set aside for another 30 minutes.\n7 Dimple the bread: Dimple the breads with your thumb. Push in to about the end of your thumbnail, roughly 1/2-inch.\n8 Second rise: Cover the dough again and leave it to rise for its final rise, about 2 hours.\n9 Preheat oven: With 30 minutes to go before the rise finishes, preheat your oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. If you have a pizza stone put it in.\n10 Brush with olive oil, sprinkle with salt: Once the dough has done its final rise, gently paint the top with olive oil \xe2\x80\x94 as much as you want.\nThen sprinkle the coarse salt on top from about a foot over the bread; this lets the salt spread out better on its way down and helps reduce clumps of salt.\n11 Bake: Put the bread in the oven. If you are doing free-form breads, put it right on the pizza stone. Bake at 400\xc2\xb0F for a total of 20-25 minutes.\nIf you have a water spritzer bottle, spritz a little water in the oven right before you put the bread in to create steam, and then a couple of times while the bread is baking.\n12 Cool and serve: When the bread comes out of the oven, turn it out onto a rack within 3-5 minutes; this way you'll keep the bottom of the bread crispy. Let cool on a rack for 10 minutes before eating.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"

b"Print\nIrish Brown Bread Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 35 minutesYield: Makes 1 large or 2 small loaves\nLook for bran and stone ground whole wheat flour with the specialty flours in the baking section of your grocery store. Two good brands are Bob's Red Mill and Arrowhead Mills, both of which can also be ordered online.\nINGREDIENTS\nVegetable oil spray (for the loaf pan)\n1 1/2 cups (350g) warm water (about 100\xc2\xb0F)\n2 tablespoons milk\n2 tablespoons molasses\n2 teaspoons active dry yeast (slightly less than one package)\n1/2 cup (25 grams) coarse wheat bran, plus more for sprinkling\n2 teaspoons salt\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n3 1/2 cups (450g) stoneground whole wheat flour\n1 teaspoon vegetable oil\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the pan(s): Generously spray a 9-inch loaf pan (or two 8 by 3 3/4-inch loaf pans\xe2\x80\x94disposable aluminum pans are the perfect size) with non-stick spray.\n2 Mix and knead the dough by hand: In a large bowl, stir the warm water, milk, molasses and yeast together and let stand until the mixture starts to bubble, about 5 minutes. Add the wheat bran, salt, butter and 2 cups of the flour.  Beat vigorously with a wooden spoon in the same direction for 1 minute.\nAdd enough of the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, until the dough is difficult to stir with a wooden spoon and pulls away from the side of the bowl.\nUsing one hand to hold the bowl, use your other hand to knead the dough in the bowl for a minute or two. The dough will stick to your hands but should pull away from the side of the bowl after about a minute. If necessary, add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time. While the dough will be damp, it should not feel muddy.\nAlternatively, mix with a stand mixer on medium speed with the paddle attachment, beating for about 1 minute until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl.\n3 Shape the loaf: On a lightly floured work surface, pat the dough into an oval shape approximately 9 inches long with the long side of the oval parallel to the edge of the work surface. Starting with the long side closest to you, roll the dough into a tight cylinder. Pinch the seam closed.\nFlip the loaf over, so it's seam-side down. Tuck the ends under so the loaf is uniform and even. Place the dough in the pan with the seam side down.\n(To make 2 small loaves, divide the dough in half and shape as above, making the oval 7 inches long.)\n4 Let the dough rise: Drizzle the vegetable oil on top of the dough and smooth it over the dough as you pat it into the corners of the pan. Sprinkle with extra bran, if you like. Cover the pan loosely with plastic wrap and let rise for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, or until the dough rises about 1 inch above the top of the pan,\n5 Heat the oven: About 20 minutes before the loaf is ready to be baked, position a rack in the lower third of the oven and preheat it to 400\xc2\xb0F.\n6 Bake the loaf: Place the loaf in the oven and immediately reduce the heat to 375\xc2\xb0F. Bake for 35 minutes for a large loaf, or 25 to 30 minutes for 2 small loaves, or until the loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom.\n7 Harden the crust: Remove the bread from the oven and immediately turn it out of the pan. Place it directly on the oven rack and continue to bake for 7 to 10 minutes, or until the crust browns.\n8 Cool the loaf: Remove and set on a wire rack to cool. When thoroughly cool, store the loaves in plastic bags.\nThe bread is best eaten on the day it\xe2\x80\x99s made, but after a day or two it is still good toasted for breakfast or tea. Well-wrapped in plastic and then foil, the bread may be stored in the freezer for up to a month.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nPanzanella Bread Salad Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesMarinating time: 30 minutesYield: Serves 6-8\nAs you cut the tomatoes, remove some of the seeds and liquid. Your panzanella will be juicy enough. Leave the crusts on the bread chunks; they will stay chewier and give the panzanella more substance.\nIf you don't have stale bread sitting around, you can take fresh crusty bread, cut it into big cubes, lay the cubes out on a baking sheet, and put in a 300\xc2\xb0F oven for 5-10 minutes, until the outer edges have dried out a bit (not toasted, just dried). If you use fresh bread without doing this, the bread may disintegrate into mush in the salad.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 cups tomatoes, cut into large chunks\n4 cups day old (somewhat dry and hard) crusty bread (Italian or French loaf), cut into chunks the same size as the tomatoes (see Recipe Note)\n1 cucumber, skinned and seeded, cut into large chunks\n1/2 red onion, chopped\n1 bunch fresh basil, torn into little pieces\n1/4 to 1/2 cup high quality extra virgin olive oil\nSalt and pepper to taste\nMETHOD\nMix everything together and let marinate, covered, at room temperature for at least 30 minutes.\nIf refrigerating, let come to room temperature before serving.\nHello!

b"Print\nParker House Rolls Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 18 minutesRising time: 1 hourYield: 3 dozen rolls\nNote that the rolls do not rise a second time once shaped.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 1/4 teaspoons (1 envelope) active dry yeast\n3 tablespoons lukewarm water\n1 1/2 cups (355 ml) whole milk\n3 tablespoons butter, cut into chunks\n3 tablespoons sugar\n2 teaspoons salt\n4 1/2 cups (630 g) flour, plus more if needed\n6 tablespoons melted unsalted butter, for brushing the rolls\nSpecial equipment:\n2 1/2-inch plain round cutter\nPastry brush\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Dissolve the yeast: In a bowl large enough to hold all the dough, sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it dissolve, about 5 minutes.\n2 Warm the milk: In a saucepan over low heat, combine the milk, 3 tablespoons cut-up butter, sugar, and salt. Heat just until the butter melts and the milk feels warm to the touch of a fingertip. If the milk gets too hot, remove from the heat and let it cool to lukewarm.\n3 Mix the dough: Stir the yeast mixture with a wooden spoon to mix the dissolved yeast and water. Tip in the milk mixture, still stirring, until smooth. Add 2 cups of the flour and stir again until the mixture is almost smooth, with just a few lumps.\nContinue stirring in flour, 1 cup at a time, until the mixture forms a dough. It will be very soft.\n4 Knead the dough: Turn the dough out onto a floured counter and knead for a few minutes until the dough is smooth, adding more flour as needed if the dough is very sticky.\n5 Let the dough rise: Clean and dry the bowl, then grease lightly with a little vegetable oil. Set the dough in the bowl and turn it all around so it is oiled all over.\nCover with a clean, damp kitchen towel or plastic wrap, and set in a warm place to rise for 1 hour, or until it is puffy (it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to double in bulk).\n6 Preheat the oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.\n7 Shape the rolls: Punch the dough down in the bowl, then transfer it to a lightly floured counter or pastry board. Knead until all the air is out.\nRoll the dough to a 1/4-inch thickness. If it springs back as you try to roll it, let it rest for 5 minutes and then try again.\nUse a 2 1/2-inch round biscuit or cookie cutter to stamp out rounds. Dip the cutter in flour often to avoid sticking, and stamp the rounds as close to each other as possible.\nPress the back of a butter knife down the center of each round to form a crease; this is where you will fold the rolls in half. Dip the knife in flour if it starts to stick to the dough.\nBrush the rounds with melted butter. Fold each round in half to make half-moon shapes and press the edges together lightly to seal them. Gather and reroll the scraps to make more rolls.\nTransfer the rolls to the baking sheets, leaving 2-inches between rolls. Brush with more melted butter.\n8 Bake the rolls: Transfer the baking sheets to the oven and bake for 15 to 18 minutes, rotating the sheets halfway through baking, until the rolls are puffed and golden. They're best served warm and fresh, but leftovers will keep for a few days in an airtight container at room temperature.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nTomato and Bread Soup (Pappa al Pomodoro) Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 6\nGiven that the primary ingredient in this soup is tomato, the quality of tomatoes you use is vital to the taste of the soup. Use a good quality canned tomato such as a San Marzano or Muir Glen. If using fresh tomatoes, use very ripe, in-season tomatoes.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups diced yellow onion\n4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided 2 Tbsp and 2 Tbsp\n5 cloves garlic, minced\n2 28-ounce cans whole peeled tomatoes (or about 4 pounds of fresh, ripe tomatoes, that are blanched, peeled, and chopped*)\n3 bay leaves\n2 cups of chicken stock\n1 1/2 cups of cubed rustic bread, 1 1/2-inch cubes (about 2 to 3 thick slices of Italian loaf), day old is best\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n1/2 teaspoon salt, less or more to taste\nFreshly grated Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh basil or parsley for garnish\n*To prepare fresh tomatoes for this recipe, cut out the stem end, score the bottoms with a sharp knife. Put into boiling water and boil for 1 minute. Place in ice water to quickly cool. Peel back the tomato peels and discard. Chop the tomatoes, saving as much of the juice as you can. Add the chopped tomatoes and the juice in place of the canned tomatoes in step 2.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions, garlic: Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil on medium heat in a 5 to 6-quart thick-bottomed pot. Add the diced onions and cook slowly until softened and beginning to color, about 10-12 minutes.\nAdd minced garlic and cook a minute more.\n2 Add tomatoes, stock, bay leaves, oregano, then simmer: Add tomatoes to the pot with the onions, crushing them by hand as you put them in the pot. Discard any hard stem ends or stray tomato skins. Add chicken stock, bay leaves, and dried oregano.\nHeat to a simmer and reduce heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for 20 minutes.\nAs you are cooking the tomato soup base, prepare the bread croutons in the next step.\n3 Toast croutons on stovetop: Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. Once the oil is hot, add the cubed bread to the pan. Toss to coat with the oil and spread the cubes out in a single layer.\nLet sit in pan without moving until one side is golden browned, then use tongs to turn over to another side. Once at least two sides have browned, remove from heat.\n4 Add croutons to soup: Once the tomatoes have cooked for 20 minutes, add the lightly browned croutons to the soup. Cook for 5 minutes. Turn off the heat and cover the pan. Let sit for 10-15 minutes.\n5 Pur\xc3\xa9e: Remove the bay leaves. Use an immersion blender or upright blender to roughly pur\xc3\xa9e the soup (about half of the soup, leave some chunky bits).\nGarnish with freshly grated Parmesan and chopped fresh basil or parsley.\nHello!

Do not use stale beer for this recipe, you want the carbonation.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 cups self-rising flour*\n1/2 cup white sugar\n1/3 cup unsulfured molasses\nA pinch of salt (roughly 1/8 teaspoon)\n12 ounces of Guinness extra stout\nButter for greasing the pan and painting the top, about 3 tablespoons\n* If you don't have self-rising flour, you can substitute using a ratio of 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, plus 1/8 teaspoon of salt, for every cup of self-rising flour. Have made both ways though and got better results from the self-rising flour.\nMETHOD\n1 Preheat oven and prepare loaf pan: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan well with butter.\n2 Whisk together the flour, salt and sugar in a large bowl.\n3 Slowly add Guinness to the flour, add molasses: Slowly pour the Guinness into the flour mixture. (The \xe2\x80\x9cpub cans\xe2\x80\x9d are larger than 12 ounces, but they have better carbonation, so I pour most of it out and leave a swig to drink. This has never failed me, but if you are a stickler, use a 12-ounce bottle of Guinness instead.)\nStart stirring the beer into the dry ingredients, and when you are about halfway done, add the molasses. Mix well, just to combine.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t work the heck out of the batter \xe2\x80\x93 because that\xe2\x80\x99s what it\xe2\x80\x99ll look like \xe2\x80\x93 but you don\xe2\x80\x99t want lumps, either.\n4 Bake: Pour into the loaf pan to no more than 2/3 full. Pop into the oven immediately and bake at 350\xc2\xb0F for 50 minutes. Since ovens can vary, check the bread after 40 minutes and see if a tester inserted into the deepest part of the loaf comes out clean. If it does, you\xe2\x80\x99re done.\n5 Cool and paint with butter: Let the loaf cool a bit, maybe 5 minutes, and then turn it out onto a rack.

b'Print\nPeach Melba French Toast Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 50 minutesYield: Serves 12\nYou can use frozen or fresh peaches in this baked French toast. If using fresh peaches, peel them first. If using frozen, thaw them first and check the size. Most frozen peaches are cut thick. If they look to be an inch thick or more, just slice them in half lengthwise.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 large loaf brioche, challah, or crusty bread (about 21 ounces)\n2 tablespoons butter, softened\n8 ounces fresh or frozen peaches, peeled and sliced 1/2 inch thick\n6 ounces fresh or frozen raspberries\n8 large eggs\n2 1/3 cups heavy whipping cream\n3/4 cup sugar\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\nFor the topping:\n2 tablespoons sugar\n1/2 cup sliced almonds (optional)\nFor the raspberry sauce:\n10 ounces fresh or frozen raspberries\n1/4 cup sugar\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1/8 teaspoon salt\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Prepare the baking dish: Generously spread 2 tablespoons of butter on the bottom and sides of a 9x13 baking dish.\n3 Prepare the bread and fruit: Cut or tear the bread into 2x2-inch pieces. Place an even layer of bread on the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Dot the top of the bread with 2/3 of the raspberries, and layer all of the peach slices around the raspberries. Top with another layer of bread pieces. Tuck the remaining berries into cracks and crevices on the top of the dish.\n4 Make the custard: In a large bowl, aggressively whisk together the eggs so they are one homogeneous color (about 30 seconds). Add the heavy cream, sugar, extract, and salt. Whisk aggressively together for about a minute.\nPour the custard over the bread and fruit mixture. Gently smoosh the bread down into the custard so everything is moistened.\n5 Finish the casserole prep: Sprinkle the top evenly with 2 tablespoons sugar and sliced almonds.\nAt this point, the casserole can be baked right away, or covered and refrigerated overnight and baked in the morning. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F when ready to bake.\n6 Bake: Bake the casserole for 50 minutes. The bread will puff up and the top should be golden with toasty bits.\n7 While the casserole is baking, make the raspberry sauce: Set a fine mesh strainer over a bowl and set aside.\nSet a small sauce pan over medium heat. Add frozen raspberries, sugar, vanilla, and salt. Stir occasionally while mashing the berries down with the back of a spatula, allowing the berries to release their juices while gently simmering. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want this to boil or aggressively simmer, because it would reduce the sauce too much. This should only take about 5-7 minutes.\nOnce the berries have released their juices, pour the sauce through the fine mesh sieve, pressing down to release as much of the sauce as you can. Discard the solids.\n8 Serve: Remove the French toast casserole from the oven and let rest for 10 minutes. Cut into pieces, and transfer to a plate. Drizzle each piece with raspberry sauce.\nHello!

Grease the inside of a 6-quart slow cooker with the softened butter.\n2 Toast the bread: Spread the bread cubes in a single layer on a large sheet pan or two smaller pans. Bake for 20 minutes, stirring halfway through toasting. The bread should be lightly golden, dry, and crisp. Remove the bread cubes from the oven and let them cool for 10 minutes.\nOnce cool, transfer toasted bread to the slow cooker and arrange in an even layer.\n3 Make the custard: In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs. Add the half-and-half, granulated sugar, brown sugar, vanilla extract, cinnamon, nutmeg, salt, and mashed bananas to the bowl with the eggs, and whisk to combine.\n4 Add the custard to the bread cubes: Pour the custard mixture over bread. Press the bread into the liquid to submerge. Cover and transfer to the refrigerator for at least 60 minutes, or up to 24 hours.\n5 Bring the casserole to room temperature: Remove the casserole from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n6 Cook casserole: Place the slow cooker insert into the slow cooker base, cover it with a lid, and cook it on the high setting for 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours, or on the low setting for 4 to 5 hours.\nThe casserole is ready when the custard is set in the center and puffy; it should not be runny or jiggle. It will shrink slightly once the heat is turned off. The center of the casserole should be above 175\xc2\xbaF when tested with a thermometer.\n7 Make the caramel sauce: In a medium high-sided saucepan add the sugar and water. Set the pan over medium-low heat and let the sugar dissolve without stirring. This should take about 3 to 5 minutes.\nWhen it\xe2\x80\x99s ready, the granules will be dissolved, and it will look just like gently bubbling clear water. (If you see sugar granules on the sides of the pan. Dip a pastry brush into a cup of tap water, and \xe2\x80\x9cpaint\xe2\x80\x9d the inside of the pan with the wet brush to wash away any undissolved sugar.)\nOnce the sugar has dissolved completely, increase the heat to high and bring sugar to a low boil. Stir with a whisk until a deep amber color is formed and the temperature reads between 320\xc2\xbaF to 340\xc2\xbaF on a candy thermometer. This should take about 5 to 7 minutes. If your sugar boils rapidly, reduce the heat to medium high.\nRemove the caramel from the heat.\nSlowly and carefully whisk in 1/3 of the heavy cream in a thin stream. The caramel will bubble as the cream is added; allow it to subside before adding the rest of the cream. Whisk in the butter, cinnamon, and salt until smooth.\nLet the sauce cool at room temperature for about 10 minutes before using, it will thicken as it cools, but still be pourable. (You can store the sauce in an airtight container for up to one week in the refrigerator.)\n8 To serve: Allow the casserole to rest for at least 15 minutes before serving. Serve warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream, caramel sauce, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nHow to Make Eggs Benedict Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Makes 4 one-egg one-muffin servings\nEggs benedict is also great made with slices of smoked salmon in place of the bacon. If you are in or around New Jersey, try it with Taylor ham.\nINGREDIENTS\n8 pieces of bacon or 4 pieces of Canadian bacon\n2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish\n4 eggs\n2 teaspoons white or rice vinegar\n2 English muffins\nButter\nBlender Hollandaise\n10 tablespoons unsalted butter (if using salted butter, omit the added salt)\n3 egg yolks\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nDash of cayenne or tabasco\nMETHOD\n1 Cook the bacon: Heat a large skillet on medium low heat. Add the strips of bacon or the slices of Canadian bacon. Slowly fry, turning occasionally, until the bacon is browned on both sides, and if using strip bacon, much of the fat is rendered out (about 10 minutes).\nUse tongs or a fork to remove the bacon from the pan, set on a paper towel to absorb the excess fat.\nDon't pour the bacon fat left in the pan down the drain! Either sop it up with paper towels when it has cooled a bit, or pour it into a jar to be used later (see rendering bacon fat).\n2 Bring poaching water to a simmer: While the bacon is cooking, bring a large saucepan two-thirds-filled with water to a boil, then add the vinegar. Bring the water to a boil again, then lower the heat to a bare simmer.\n3 Make Hollandaise sauce in blender: To make blender hollandaise, melt 10 Tbsp unsalted butter.\nPut 3 egg yolks, a tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender, blend on medium to medium high speed for 20-30 seconds, until eggs lighten in color.\nTurn blender down to lowest setting, slowly dribble in the hot melted butter, while continuing to blend. Taste for salt and acidity and add more salt or lemon juice to taste.\nTransfer it to a container you can use for pouring and set it on a warm\xe2\x80\x94but not hot\xe2\x80\x94place on or near the stovetop.\n4 Poach the eggs: Here is an easy method for poaching eggs. Essentially, working one egg at a time you crack an egg into a small bowl and slip it into the barely simmering water. Once it begins to solidify, you can slip in another egg, until you have all four cooking.\nTurn off the heat, cover the pan, and let sit for 4 minutes. (Remember which egg went in first, you'll want to take it out first.) When it comes time to remove the eggs, gently lift out with a slotted spoon.\nNote that the timing is a little variable on the eggs, depending on the size of your pan, how much water, how many eggs, and how runny you like them. You might have to experiment a little with your set-up to figure out what you need to do to get the eggs exactly the way you like them.\n5 Toast English muffins: As soon as all the eggs are in the poaching water, begin toasting your English muffins. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t get all the muffins toasted by the time the eggs are ready, gently remove the eggs from the poaching water and set in a bowl.\n6 Assemble your Eggs Benedict: To assemble, butter one side of an English muffin. Top with two slices of bacon or 1 slice of Canadian bacon. You can trim the bacon to fit the muffin if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\nPut a poached egg on top of the bacon, then pour some hollandaise over. Sprinkle some parsley over it all and serve at once.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"
b'Print\nEasy Poached Eggs\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 4 minutesYield: 1 or more poached eggs\nFresh eggs work best for poaching. Their whites hold together better than older eggs. Some people put a little vinegar in the poaching water\xe2\x80\x94the vinegar helps the proteins in the egg whites coagulate. But the vinegar does affect the taste. I usually skip it.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 or more fresh eggs\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the water: Fill a saucepan with several inches of water. Heat the water on high until it reaches a boil and then lower the heat until the water is at a bare simmer (just a few bubbles coming up now and then).\n2 Crack egg into a small bowl and gently slip it into the water: Working with the eggs one at a time, crack the egg into a small bowl or cup. Place the bowl close to the surface of the hot water and gently slip the egg into the water.\nIf you want, use a spoon to push some of the egg whites closer to their yolks, to help them hold together. Add all of the eggs you are poaching to the pan in the same way, keeping some distance between them.\n3 Turn off heat, cover pan, set timer for 4 minutes: Turn off the heat and cover the pan. Set a timer for 4 minutes (or count out loud to 60, four times). At this point the egg whites should be completely cooked, while the egg yolks are still runny.\nNote that the timing depends on the size of the eggs, the number of eggs in the pot, and if you are cooking at altitude, so adjust accordingly. If you are at altitude, want firmer egg yolks, or are poaching more than 4 eggs at once, you may need to cook them longer. If you try 4 minutes and the eggs are too cooked, reduce the time.\n4 Remove eggs with slotted spoon: Gently lift the poached eggs out of the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a plate to serve.\nUSING A FINE MESH SIEVE\nOne way to help your poached egg whites stay together is to remove some of the thin wispy egg whites before you add your eggs to the hot water. An easy way to do this is with a fine mesh sieve.\n1 Strain thin whites with a fine mesh sieve: Place the raw egg into a fine mesh sieve over a bowl. The very thin egg whites will drain out through the sieve.\n2 Gently add to hot water: Then gently ease the raw egg into your pot of simmering hot water.\n3 Turn off heat, cover pot, cook 4 minutes: Notice how there is much less stray egg whites with this method? Turn off the heat and cover the pot (or just lower the heat to low), and cook for 4 minutes until the whites are cooked through. (You may need to add more time if cooking at altitude or poaching more than 4 eggs at once.)\nRemove from the pot with a slotted spoon.\nUSING AN EGG POACHER\nIf you don\'t want to futz around with trying to keep the eggs from spreading or bumping into each other, the easiest way to make poached eggs is with an egg poacher.\nThe "poacher" is actually coddling the eggs, not truly poaching them, but if what you want is an egg with a cooked white and runny yolk, this is an easy way to do it.\nTo use an egg poaching pan, remove the cups from the pan that you intend to use.\nFill the pan with only 1/2-inch of water and bring it to a low boil. Put a drop or so of olive oil in each of the egg cups you are using and spread around. (The cups are stick-free, but the oil helps.)\nCrack the eggs into the egg cups, one egg per cup. Place the egg filled cup back in the slot for it in the pan.\nCover the pan and cook for 4 minutes.\nRemove from heat and carefully lift the egg cups out of the pan. Slide the cooked eggs out of the cups onto serving plates or bowls.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Print\nSausage Breakfast Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 6 to 8\nBread that is a little bit dry will hold up better in the casserole and provide more structure, which is why breakfast casseroles tend to call for "day old" bread. If your bread is fresh or soft, after you cube it, spread it out on a sheet pan and put it in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 to 12 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Italian pork sausage\n10 large eggs, beaten\n4 cups whole milk\n1 teaspoon dry mustard\n1/4 teaspoon onion powder\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\nFresh ground pepper to taste\n5 cups cubed day old bread (we recommend rustic French or Italian loaf), cut into 3/4-inch to 1 inch-wide cubes\n2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese\n1/2 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)\n1/2 cup peeled, cored, chopped tomatoes (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the sausage: Heat a skillet on medium. Break up the sausage into chunks and cook, working in batches if need be, until cooked on all sides. As you cook the sausage, you can break up the larger chunks into smaller crumbles (which are easier to distribute evenly over the casserole).\nWhen lightly browned, remove from pan to a paper towel lined plate to absorb any excess fat.\n2 In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, dry mustard, onion powder, salt and pepper.\n3 Assemble the casserole: Place the cubed bread in a well-buttered 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle with cheese. Sprinkle with chopped tomatoes and mushrooms, if using. Top with the browned crumbled sausage, distributing it evenly. Pour the egg milk mixture evenly over the bread and cheese.\n4 Cover and chill, if making ahead: At this point, the casserole can be covered and chilled in the fridge until ready to bake and serve, up to overnight.\nIf baking immediately, let the casserole sit for 10 minutes before putting in the oven (to give the bread a chance to absorb the milk-egg mixture.\n5 Bake the casserole: When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xb0F. Bake uncovered for about one hour. Tent with foil if the top begins to brown too quickly.\n6 Serve: Let the casserole cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for about a week.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'
b"Print\nEasy Breakfast Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 50 minutesYield: Serves 8\nThe ingredient proportions are estimates. The more eggs, the firmer and less likely to deflate the casserole will be.\nMushrooms tend to hold a lot of moisture, so if you use a lot of them, you may want to saut\xc3\xa9 them first to release some of their water.\nDon't have day-old bread? Put slices of fresh bread into a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the breakfast casserole base:\n6 to 10 large eggs\n2 to 3 cups grated cheddar cheese\n6 slices day-old bread, cut into 3/4-inch to 1-inch-wide cubes\n2 cups milk\nSalt\nPepper\nFor the possible additions: \n1 cup corn (cooked or frozen)\n1/2 cup chopped broccoli (cooked or raw, raw will turn out crunchier)\n1/2 cup sliced mushrooms\n1/4 cup sliced green onions\n1 cup cubed ham and/or cooked Italian sausage\nA few slices cooked bacon, chopped\n1 teaspoon Herbes de Provence, or other dried herbs, (or 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped herbs such as basil, rosemary, or thyme)\n1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of cumin or curry powder\nSpecial equipment:\n9x13 inch casserole dish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Beat eggs, add milk and cheese: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the milk and cheese.\n2 Add the bread and carefully stir until all pieces of bread are moistened (don't over mix or the bread may disintegrate).\n3 Add the additions: Add salt and pepper to taste (if using Italian sausage, you won't need either.) If you have a lot of additions, you might need a couple more eggs to make sure that everything is at least touching some egg mixture. Just whisk in 2 tablespoons of milk for every beaten egg you add.\n4 Bake: Butter a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Pour the mixture into the casserole dish.\nBake in a 350\xc2\xb0F oven for 50 minutes to an hour, until the top is browned and the center springs back when touched.\nRemove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.\nHello!

b"Print\nHuevos Rancheros Recipe\nCook time: 20 minutesYield: Makes 2-4 servings\nThe recipe is flexible, sometimes we use canned salsa and just add a few more chopped tomatoes and some chopped pickled jalape\xc3\xb1os to make the sauce.\nSometimes if we have some leftover refried beans, we'll spread some on the tortillas before topping them with the eggs and salsa. My mother has been known to add a pinch of sugar to the salsa sauce if she feels it's too acidic for her taste.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n1/2 medium onion, chopped (about a half cup)\n1 15-ounce can whole or crushed tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted, (or 1 -2 large fresh vine-ripened tomatoes, when in season)\n1/2 6-ounce can diced green Anaheim chiles\nChipotle chili powder, adobo sauce, or ground cumin to taste (optional)\n4 corn tortillas\nButter\n4 fresh eggs\n2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the sauce: Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions in a little olive oil in a large skillet on medium heat. Once the onions are translucent, add the tomatoes and their juices. If using whole canned tomatoes, break them up with your fingers or a spatula as you put them in the pan.\nIf you are using fresh tomatoes, chop them first, then add. Note that fresh tomatoes will take longer to cook as canned tomatoes are already cooked to begin with.\nAdd chopped green chilies. Add additional chili to taste, either chipotle chili powder, adobo sauce, regular chili powder, or even ground cumin.\nBring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and let simmer while you do the rest of the cooking, stirring occasionally. Reduce to warm after it has been simmering for 10 minutes. Add salt to taste if needed.\n2 Warm the plates: Heat the oven to a warm 150\xc2\xb0F, place serving plates in the oven to keep warm.\n3 Prepare the tortillas: Heat a teaspoon of olive oil in a large non-stick skillet on medium high, coating the pan with the oil.\nOne by one (or more if your pan is big enough) heat the tortillas in the pan, a minute or two on each side, until they are heated through, softened, and pockets of air bubble up inside of them.\nThen remove them and stack them on one of the warming plates in the oven to keep warm while you continue cooking the rest of the tortillas and the eggs.\n4 Fry the eggs: Using the same skillet as was used for the tortillas, add a little butter to the pan, about two teaspoons for 4 eggs. Heat the pan on medium high heat. Crack 4 eggs into the skillet and cook for 3 to 4 minutes for runny yolks, more for firmer eggs.\n5 Assemble and serve: To serve, spoon a little of the sauce onto a warmed plate. Top with a tortilla, then a fried egg. Top with more sauce, sprinkle with cilantro if desired.\nServe either one or two eggs/tortillas per plate, depending on how much you want to eat.

Whole Foods has a standard recipe and spices for making chorizo sausage and may make some up for you upon request if you don't see it displayed.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the onions: Heat a large skillet on medium high heat. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil or bacon fat in the pan. Add the chopped onions (optional) and cook until softened.\n2 Add the chorizo and raisins: Once softened, move the onions to the side of the pan and add clumps of chorizo into the pan. Use a wooden spatula to break up the pieces of sausage. Add the raisins.\nStir until the sausage is cooked through, though not necessarily browned. If you are not using lean chorizo, drain the excess fat from the pan before proceeding.\nIf you are not using lean chorizo, you may want to cook the chorizo first, draining the excess fat, then remove to a plate while you cook the onions in the remaining fat. We usually cook with lean chorizo, so excess fat isn't an issue.\n3 Add the eggs: Crack the eggs one at a time, into the pan. Break the yolks and stir the eggs into the sausage.

Line a roasting pan, or baking sheet that can take high temperatures without warping, with parchment paper or Silpat.\n2 Separate the eggs: Separate the egg yolks from the whites. Make sure there are no little pieces of egg yolk in the whites or you will have difficulty getting the whites to beat properly. It helps if you are making more than one egg nest to keep each egg yolk in a separate prep bowl.\n3 Beat eggs to stiff peaks: Place the egg whites in a very clean mixer bowl (any residual oil in the mixer bowl will keep the egg whites from whipping up properly).\nAdd a small pinch of salt to the egg whites. Beat the egg whites with a whisk attachment in a mixer (or using a hand mixer), starting on low speed and then slowly increasing to high speed, until stiff peaks form.\n4 Gently fold in the grated cheese, taking care not to deflate the egg whites.\n5 Create two mounds of the egg white mixture on the lined baking sheet. Form the mounds so they look like nests, with indentations in the centers.\n6 Bake: Place in the 450\xc2\xb0F (230\xc2\xb0C) oven for 3 minutes.

b"Print\nHow to Make Eggs Benedict Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Makes 4 one-egg one-muffin servings\nEggs benedict is also great made with slices of smoked salmon in place of the bacon. If you are in or around New Jersey, try it with Taylor ham.\nINGREDIENTS\n8 pieces of bacon or 4 pieces of Canadian bacon\n2 tablespoons chopped parsley, for garnish\n4 eggs\n2 teaspoons white or rice vinegar\n2 English muffins\nButter\nBlender Hollandaise\n10 tablespoons unsalted butter (if using salted butter, omit the added salt)\n3 egg yolks\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nDash of cayenne or tabasco\nMETHOD\n1 Cook the bacon: Heat a large skillet on medium low heat. Add the strips of bacon or the slices of Canadian bacon. Slowly fry, turning occasionally, until the bacon is browned on both sides, and if using strip bacon, much of the fat is rendered out (about 10 minutes).\nUse tongs or a fork to remove the bacon from the pan, set on a paper towel to absorb the excess fat.\nDon't pour the bacon fat left in the pan down the drain! Either sop it up with paper towels when it has cooled a bit, or pour it into a jar to be used later (see rendering bacon fat).\n2 Bring poaching water to a simmer: While the bacon is cooking, bring a large saucepan two-thirds-filled with water to a boil, then add the vinegar. Bring the water to a boil again, then lower the heat to a bare simmer.\n3 Make Hollandaise sauce in blender: To make blender hollandaise, melt 10 Tbsp unsalted butter.\nPut 3 egg yolks, a tablespoon of lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon salt in a blender, blend on medium to medium high speed for 20-30 seconds, until eggs lighten in color.\nTurn blender down to lowest setting, slowly dribble in the hot melted butter, while continuing to blend. Taste for salt and acidity and add more salt or lemon juice to taste.\nTransfer it to a container you can use for pouring and set it on a warm\xe2\x80\x94but not hot\xe2\x80\x94place on or near the stovetop.\n4 Poach the eggs: Here is an easy method for poaching eggs. Essentially, working one egg at a time you crack an egg into a small bowl and slip it into the barely simmering water. Once it begins to solidify, you can slip in another egg, until you have all four cooking.\nTurn off the heat, cover the pan, and let sit for 4 minutes. (Remember which egg went in first, you'll want to take it out first.) When it comes time to remove the eggs, gently lift out with a slotted spoon.\nNote that the timing is a little variable on the eggs, depending on the size of your pan, how much water, how many eggs, and how runny you like them. You might have to experiment a little with your set-up to figure out what you need to do to get the eggs exactly the way you like them.\n5 Toast English muffins: As soon as all the eggs are in the poaching water, begin toasting your English muffins. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t get all the muffins toasted by the time the eggs are ready, gently remove the eggs from the poaching water and set in a bowl.\n6 Assemble your Eggs Benedict: To assemble, butter one side of an English muffin. Top with two slices of bacon or 1 slice of Canadian bacon. You can trim the bacon to fit the muffin if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\nPut a poached egg on top of the bacon, then pour some hollandaise over. Sprinkle some parsley over it all and serve at once.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"
b'Print\nEasy Poached Eggs\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 4 minutesYield: 1 or more poached eggs\nFresh eggs work best for poaching. Their whites hold together better than older eggs. Some people put a little vinegar in the poaching water\xe2\x80\x94the vinegar helps the proteins in the egg whites coagulate. But the vinegar does affect the taste. I usually skip it.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 or more fresh eggs\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the water: Fill a saucepan with several inches of water. Heat the water on high until it reaches a boil and then lower the heat until the water is at a bare simmer (just a few bubbles coming up now and then).\n2 Crack egg into a small bowl and gently slip it into the water: Working with the eggs one at a time, crack the egg into a small bowl or cup. Place the bowl close to the surface of the hot water and gently slip the egg into the water.\nIf you want, use a spoon to push some of the egg whites closer to their yolks, to help them hold together. Add all of the eggs you are poaching to the pan in the same way, keeping some distance between them.\n3 Turn off heat, cover pan, set timer for 4 minutes: Turn off the heat and cover the pan. Set a timer for 4 minutes (or count out loud to 60, four times). At this point the egg whites should be completely cooked, while the egg yolks are still runny.\nNote that the timing depends on the size of the eggs, the number of eggs in the pot, and if you are cooking at altitude, so adjust accordingly. If you are at altitude, want firmer egg yolks, or are poaching more than 4 eggs at once, you may need to cook them longer. If you try 4 minutes and the eggs are too cooked, reduce the time.\n4 Remove eggs with slotted spoon: Gently lift the poached eggs out of the pan with a slotted spoon and place on a plate to serve.\nUSING A FINE MESH SIEVE\nOne way to help your poached egg whites stay together is to remove some of the thin wispy egg whites before you add your eggs to the hot water. An easy way to do this is with a fine mesh sieve.\n1 Strain thin whites with a fine mesh sieve: Place the raw egg into a fine mesh sieve over a bowl. The very thin egg whites will drain out through the sieve.\n2 Gently add to hot water: Then gently ease the raw egg into your pot of simmering hot water.\n3 Turn off heat, cover pot, cook 4 minutes: Notice how there is much less stray egg whites with this method? Turn off the heat and cover the pot (or just lower the heat to low), and cook for 4 minutes until the whites are cooked through. (You may need to add more time if cooking at altitude or poaching more than 4 eggs at once.)\nRemove from the pot with a slotted spoon.\nUSING AN EGG POACHER\nIf you don\'t want to futz around with trying to keep the eggs from spreading or bumping into each other, the easiest way to make poached eggs is with an egg poacher.\nThe "poacher" is actually coddling the eggs, not truly poaching them, but if what you want is an egg with a cooked white and runny yolk, this is an easy way to do it.\nTo use an egg poaching pan, remove the cups from the pan that you intend to use.\nFill the pan with only 1/2-inch of water and bring it to a low boil. Put a drop or so of olive oil in each of the egg cups you are using and spread around. (The cups are stick-free, but the oil helps.)\nCrack the eggs into the egg cups, one egg per cup. Place the egg filled cup back in the slot for it in the pan.\nCover the pan and cook for 4 minutes.\nRemove from heat and carefully lift the egg cups out of the pan. Slide the cooked eggs out of the cups onto serving plates or bowls.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Print\nSausage Breakfast Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 6 to 8\nBread that is a little bit dry will hold up better in the casserole and provide more structure, which is why breakfast casseroles tend to call for "day old" bread. If your bread is fresh or soft, after you cube it, spread it out on a sheet pan and put it in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 to 12 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Italian pork sausage\n10 large eggs, beaten\n4 cups whole milk\n1 teaspoon dry mustard\n1/4 teaspoon onion powder\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\nFresh ground pepper to taste\n5 cups cubed day old bread (we recommend rustic French or Italian loaf), cut into 3/4-inch to 1 inch-wide cubes\n2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese\n1/2 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)\n1/2 cup peeled, cored, chopped tomatoes (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the sausage: Heat a skillet on medium. Break up the sausage into chunks and cook, working in batches if need be, until cooked on all sides. As you cook the sausage, you can break up the larger chunks into smaller crumbles (which are easier to distribute evenly over the casserole).\nWhen lightly browned, remove from pan to a paper towel lined plate to absorb any excess fat.\n2 In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, dry mustard, onion powder, salt and pepper.\n3 Assemble the casserole: Place the cubed bread in a well-buttered 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle with cheese. Sprinkle with chopped tomatoes and mushrooms, if using. Top with the browned crumbled sausage, distributing it evenly. Pour the egg milk mixture evenly over the bread and cheese.\n4 Cover and chill, if making ahead: At this point, the casserole can be covered and chilled in the fridge until ready to bake and serve, up to overnight.\nIf baking immediately, let the casserole sit for 10 minutes before putting in the oven (to give the bread a chance to absorb the milk-egg mixture.\n5 Bake the casserole: When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xb0F. Bake uncovered for about one hour. Tent with foil if the top begins to brown too quickly.\n6 Serve: Let the casserole cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for about a week.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'
b"Print\nEasy Breakfast Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 50 minutesYield: Serves 8\nThe ingredient proportions are estimates. The more eggs, the firmer and less likely to deflate the casserole will be.\nMushrooms tend to hold a lot of moisture, so if you use a lot of them, you may want to saut\xc3\xa9 them first to release some of their water.\nDon't have day-old bread? Put slices of fresh bread into a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the breakfast casserole base:\n6 to 10 large eggs\n2 to 3 cups grated cheddar cheese\n6 slices day-old bread, cut into 3/4-inch to 1-inch-wide cubes\n2 cups milk\nSalt\nPepper\nFor the possible additions: \n1 cup corn (cooked or frozen)\n1/2 cup chopped broccoli (cooked or raw, raw will turn out crunchier)\n1/2 cup sliced mushrooms\n1/4 cup sliced green onions\n1 cup cubed ham and/or cooked Italian sausage\nA few slices cooked bacon, chopped\n1 teaspoon Herbes de Provence, or other dried herbs, (or 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped herbs such as basil, rosemary, or thyme)\n1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of cumin or curry powder\nSpecial equipment:\n9x13 inch casserole dish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Beat eggs, add milk and cheese: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the milk and cheese.\n2 Add the bread and carefully stir until all pieces of bread are moistened (don't over mix or the bread may disintegrate).\n3 Add the additions: Add salt and pepper to taste (if using Italian sausage, you won't need either.) If you have a lot of additions, you might need a couple more eggs to make sure that everything is at least touching some egg mixture. Just whisk in 2 tablespoons of milk for every beaten egg you add.\n4 Bake: Butter a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Pour the mixture into the casserole dish.\nBake in a 350\xc2\xb0F oven for 50 minutes to an hour, until the top is browned and the center springs back when touched.\nRemove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.\nHello!

b"Print\nHuevos Rancheros Recipe\nCook time: 20 minutesYield: Makes 2-4 servings\nThe recipe is flexible, sometimes we use canned salsa and just add a few more chopped tomatoes and some chopped pickled jalape\xc3\xb1os to make the sauce.\nSometimes if we have some leftover refried beans, we'll spread some on the tortillas before topping them with the eggs and salsa. My mother has been known to add a pinch of sugar to the salsa sauce if she feels it's too acidic for her taste.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n1/2 medium onion, chopped (about a half cup)\n1 15-ounce can whole or crushed tomatoes, preferably fire-roasted, (or 1 -2 large fresh vine-ripened tomatoes, when in season)\n1/2 6-ounce can diced green Anaheim chiles\nChipotle chili powder, adobo sauce, or ground cumin to taste (optional)\n4 corn tortillas\nButter\n4 fresh eggs\n2 tablespoons fresh cilantro, chopped (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the sauce: Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions in a little olive oil in a large skillet on medium heat. Once the onions are translucent, add the tomatoes and their juices. If using whole canned tomatoes, break them up with your fingers or a spatula as you put them in the pan.\nIf you are using fresh tomatoes, chop them first, then add. Note that fresh tomatoes will take longer to cook as canned tomatoes are already cooked to begin with.\nAdd chopped green chilies. Add additional chili to taste, either chipotle chili powder, adobo sauce, regular chili powder, or even ground cumin.\nBring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and let simmer while you do the rest of the cooking, stirring occasionally. Reduce to warm after it has been simmering for 10 minutes. Add salt to taste if needed.\n2 Warm the plates: Heat the oven to a warm 150\xc2\xb0F, place serving plates in the oven to keep warm.\n3 Prepare the tortillas: Heat a teaspoon of olive oil in a large non-stick skillet on medium high, coating the pan with the oil.\nOne by one (or more if your pan is big enough) heat the tortillas in the pan, a minute or two on each side, until they are heated through, softened, and pockets of air bubble up inside of them.\nThen remove them and stack them on one of the warming plates in the oven to keep warm while you continue cooking the rest of the tortillas and the eggs.\n4 Fry the eggs: Using the same skillet as was used for the tortillas, add a little butter to the pan, about two teaspoons for 4 eggs. Heat the pan on medium high heat. Crack 4 eggs into the skillet and cook for 3 to 4 minutes for runny yolks, more for firmer eggs.\n5 Assemble and serve: To serve, spoon a little of the sauce onto a warmed plate. Top with a tortilla, then a fried egg. Top with more sauce, sprinkle with cilantro if desired.\nServe either one or two eggs/tortillas per plate, depending on how much you want to eat.

Whole Foods has a standard recipe and spices for making chorizo sausage and may make some up for you upon request if you don't see it displayed.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the onions: Heat a large skillet on medium high heat. Heat a tablespoon of olive oil or bacon fat in the pan. Add the chopped onions (optional) and cook until softened.\n2 Add the chorizo and raisins: Once softened, move the onions to the side of the pan and add clumps of chorizo into the pan. Use a wooden spatula to break up the pieces of sausage. Add the raisins.\nStir until the sausage is cooked through, though not necessarily browned. If you are not using lean chorizo, drain the excess fat from the pan before proceeding.\nIf you are not using lean chorizo, you may want to cook the chorizo first, draining the excess fat, then remove to a plate while you cook the onions in the remaining fat. We usually cook with lean chorizo, so excess fat isn't an issue.\n3 Add the eggs: Crack the eggs one at a time, into the pan. Break the yolks and stir the eggs into the sausage. Add a light sprinkling of salt.\nStir constantly until the eggs begin to set, but are still moist. Remove from heat.\nServe immediately with a side of warmed corn tortillas and cilantro as a garnish.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Line a roasting pan, or baking sheet that can take high temperatures without warping, with parchment paper or Silpat.\n2 Separate the eggs: Separate the egg yolks from the whites. Make sure there are no little pieces of egg yolk in the whites or you will have difficulty getting the whites to beat properly. It helps if you are making more than one egg nest to keep each egg yolk in a separate prep bowl.\n3 Beat eggs to stiff peaks: Place the egg whites in a very clean mixer bowl (any residual oil in the mixer bowl will keep the egg whites from whipping up properly).\nAdd a small pinch of salt to the egg whites. Beat the egg whites with a whisk attachment in a mixer (or using a hand mixer), starting on low speed and then slowly increasing to high speed, until stiff peaks form.\n4 Gently fold in the grated cheese, taking care not to deflate the egg whites.\n5 Create two mounds of the egg white mixture on the lined baking sheet. Form the mounds so they look like nests, with indentations in the centers.\n6 Bake: Place in the 450\xc2\xb0F (230\xc2\xb0C) oven for 3 minutes. After 3 minutes, open the oven, pull out the rack with the egg white nests, and gently add an egg yolk to the center of each nest.

b'Print\nBiscuits and Gravy Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesCook time: 35 minutesYield: 12 servings\nThe cornstarch in the biscuit dough reduces the gluten content to help keep the biscuits light and fluffy.\nIf you have White Lily Flour, use 2 1/2 cups of White Lily flour instead of all-purpose, and omit the cornstarch.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the biscuits:\n2 1/4 cups (315 g) all-purpose flour (see Recipe Note)\n3 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold\n1 cup buttermilk, cold\nFor the gravy:\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1/2 pound sliced mushrooms\n1/4 cup chopped yellow onions\n1 pound breakfast pork sausage\n6 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon ground sage\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n2 1/2 cups milk, preferably whole\nFor topping:\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted\nSpecial equipment:\n2-quart glass or ceramic baking dish, rectangular or square\n2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Make the biscuit dough: Combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch chunks and sprinkle it over the dry ingredients. Using a pastry blender, a butter knife, or a fork, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until most of it is the size of peas. Don\xe2\x80\x99t overwork it; you want to leave some of the butter in chunks.\nAdd the buttermilk and toss the mixture with a spatula until it starts to look shaggy, and most of the buttermilk has been absorbed. It won\xe2\x80\x99t form a dough yet; that\xe2\x80\x99s OK.\n3 Bring the dough together: Turn out the contents of the bowl onto a clean surface dusted with a little flour. Gather the dough together with your hands into a mound, then roll it out until it is about 10-inches wide. Again, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry if the dough is crumbly!\n4 Fold the dough to create flaky layers: Use a spatula (like the kind you use to make fried eggs) or bench scraper and flip 1/3 of the dough over from the left to the center. Then flip the other side over that side. You\xe2\x80\x99re basically folding the dough over like a letter.\nRotate the dough 90-degrees and roll it out again to about a 10-inch square. It will start to feel more like a dough and less crumbly at this point, but there will still be some loose chunks. Just press them back into the dough if they fall out, and resist the urge to add more liquid.\nRepeat the process of rolling out and folding two more times. By the fourth time, the biscuit dough will hold together and feel like actual dough.\n5 Cut the biscuits: Roll out the dough to a 10-inch square that\xe2\x80\x99s roughly 1/2 inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, cut out 16 circles. When you press down to cut out the dough, don\xe2\x80\x99t twist the biscuit cutter, which will \xe2\x80\x9cseal\xe2\x80\x9d the edges of the dough. Instead, just cut straight down, so the biscuit will rise and be as flaky as possible.\n5 Bake the bottom layer of biscuits: Set aside 12 of the biscuit rounds. Place the remaining 4 biscuit rounds on the bottom of a 2-quart glass or ceramic casserole dish. Cut up the remaining scraps of dough and jigsaw-puzzle the remaining dough into the bottom of the casserole dish, making sure to cover the bottom in a single layer.\nPlace on a rimmed baking sheet (for ease of removal from the oven and to catch any drips). Bake in the oven for 15 minutes or until the top of the biscuits start to look dry but not brown at all. (There might be a slight darkening around the edges, but don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed if the biscuits still look pale white.)\n6 Meanwhile, make the gravy: While the bottom biscuits are baking, make the gravy by placing the oil, mushrooms, and onions in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan. Cook on high heat, stirring constantly, until the mushrooms start to soften, and the onions start to look translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or spatula, and cook until the sausage starts to brown, about 5 minutes.\nKeep the heat on high, and add the flour, sage, black pepper, nutmeg, and salt to the pan. Stir until the ingredients are absorbed. Pour in the milk, reduce heat to medium, and cook, continuing to stir until the liquid has started to bubble and thicken, about 3 to 7 minutes. You\xe2\x80\x99re now ready to assemble the casserole!\nIf the first layer of biscuits isn\xe2\x80\x99t done baking, lower the heat on the gravy to a simmer until the biscuits are done. If you still need time to finish the gravy, but the biscuits are done\xe2\x80\x94remove the casserole dish from the oven, and let it sit on the counter or stovetop while you finish the gravy.\n7 Assemble and bake the casserole: Once the gravy has thickened and the first layer of biscuits is done baking, pour or spoon the gravy over the biscuit layer in the casserole dish. Place the 12 reserved biscuits over the gravy and brush the top of the biscuits with the melted butter.\nReturn the dish to the oven and bake until the biscuits are golden brown and the gravy is bubbling and thick, about 18 to 23 minutes.\n8 Cool and serve: Let cool 10 minutes before serving warm from the casserole dish.\nHello!

b'Print\nFrench Toast Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 40 minutesChill time: overnight (optional)Yield: 6 to 8 servings\nMake-ahead instructions: Assemble the casserole through Step 4, cover well, and refrigerate overnight. The next day, uncover, drizzle the casserole with the topping, and bake. Baking time will be slightly longer.\nThis casserole reheats well, though the chunks of bread on the top will gradually lose some crunch. The best way to reheat it is to bake it in the oven at 350F for 10 to 15 minutes to warm through and re-crisp the top.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the casserole:\n1 large loaf good-quality French loaf, sourdough, ciabatta, or challah (enough to yield 10 cups of chunks of bread)\n1/2 cup (45g) chopped pecans\n5 large eggs\n1 1/2 cups whole milk\n1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar\nZest from one medium orange (optional)\n1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon salt\nFor the topping:\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n3 tablespoons (40g) dark brown sugar\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\nPinch of salt\nOptional toppings for serving:\nDried cranberries\nPowdered sugar\nMaple syrup\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 375F (190C). Place an oven rack in the center position.\n2 Slice the bread into 1-inch slices and then cut them into 1-inch cubes. You can also tear the bread apart with your hands. Leave the crusts on.\n3 Layer the bread and pecans in a baking dish: Lightly grease a 2-quart (if you want thicker slices) or 3-quart baking dish (if you want thinner slices) with cooking spray or butter. Add enough bread cubes to cover the bottom. Sprinkle a few tablespoons of pecans on top. Continue layering the bread chunks and pecans.\n4 Prepare and add the custard: In a small bowl, whisk the eggs together. Add the milk, sugar, orange zest, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and salt, and mix well. Pour the egg and milk mixture evenly over all the bread chunks. (I found it easier to pour the mixture into a large measuring cup with a spout first before pouring the mixture over the bread.)\nAt this point, the casserole can be baked right away, or covered and refrigerated overnight.\n5 Drizzle with topping: In another bowl, mix the melted butter with the brown sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Using a spoon, drizzle the mixture evenly over all the bread chunks.\n6 Bake the casserole for 35 to 45 minutes. I baked mine for about 38 minutes. Leave the casserole in the oven longer if you want the chunks of bread on the top to be more brown and crunchier.\n7 Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle dried cranberries and dust powdered sugar on top, if you like. Serve with maple syrup at the table.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nSausage Breakfast Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 6 to 8\nBread that is a little bit dry will hold up better in the casserole and provide more structure, which is why breakfast casseroles tend to call for "day old" bread. If your bread is fresh or soft, after you cube it, spread it out on a sheet pan and put it in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 to 12 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Italian pork sausage\n10 large eggs, beaten\n4 cups whole milk\n1 teaspoon dry mustard\n1/4 teaspoon onion powder\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\nFresh ground pepper to taste\n5 cups cubed day old bread (we recommend rustic French or Italian loaf), cut into 3/4-inch to 1 inch-wide cubes\n2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese\n1/2 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)\n1/2 cup peeled, cored, chopped tomatoes (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the sausage: Heat a skillet on medium. Break up the sausage into chunks and cook, working in batches if need be, until cooked on all sides. As you cook the sausage, you can break up the larger chunks into smaller crumbles (which are easier to distribute evenly over the casserole).\nWhen lightly browned, remove from pan to a paper towel lined plate to absorb any excess fat.\n2 In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, dry mustard, onion powder, salt and pepper.\n3 Assemble the casserole: Place the cubed bread in a well-buttered 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle with cheese. Sprinkle with chopped tomatoes and mushrooms, if using. Top with the browned crumbled sausage, distributing it evenly. Pour the egg milk mixture evenly over the bread and cheese.\n4 Cover and chill, if making ahead: At this point, the casserole can be covered and chilled in the fridge until ready to bake and serve, up to overnight.\nIf baking immediately, let the casserole sit for 10 minutes before putting in the oven (to give the bread a chance to absorb the milk-egg mixture.\n5 Bake the casserole: When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xb0F. Bake uncovered for about one hour. Tent with foil if the top begins to brown too quickly.\n6 Serve: Let the casserole cool for about 10 minutes before serving.

I like to cut the bagel in half (from top to bottom) and then cut each half into fourths. Try to cut the bagel into pieces that are no larger than an inch.\n3 Make the egg mix and combine with the bagels: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, salt, and pepper until no yolk is visible and the mixture is smooth.\nAdd the cut bagels to the egg mixture and, using a large spoon or spatula, toss to coat the bread in the liquid. Set this to the side to allow the bread to soak while you brown the sausage.\n3 Cook the sausage, onion, and pepper: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer (this should take about a minute).\nAdd the breakfast sausage to the pan and begin to brown it. Break up the sausage into small chunks with a wooden spoon until the sausage is about the size of pistachios. It should not look minced.\nOnce the sausage has cooked through and browned (about 5 minutes), create a well in the center of the pan using your spoon. Add the diced peppers and the onions. Stir them with the sausage and cook the mixture for an additional 3 to 4 minutes, or until the veggies are glossy and soft.\nDrain any excess fat by straining the mixture in a colander, then allow the mixture to cool for 5 minutes. This is a great time to shred your cheese if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t already.\n4 Combine the sausage, bagel and egg mixture. Once your sausage mix has cooled slightly, add it to the bagel and egg mixture. Add 1 tablespoon of the parsley and 2 cups of the cheddar cheese. Toss the ingredients together to combine evenly.\n5 Assemble the casserole: Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish and cover with aluminum foil.\nMake-ahead step: At this point, you can place the dish into the refrigerator overnight and bake in the morning. Once you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to bake, remove the casserole dish twenty minutes prior to baking, then proceed as follows.\n6 Bake the casserole: Bake, covered with foil, in the preheated oven for 20 minutes and then carefully remove the pan from the oven and remove the foil.\nReturn the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 25 minutes or until the middle is no longer jiggling, and the surface has browned.\n7 Cool and serve: Remove the pan from the oven and immediately top with the remaining cheese and parsley.

These are generally firmer than other loaves of white sandwich bread. (And if you can\'t find toasting bread, just buy sandwich bread that seems fairly firm and substantial.)\nIf the tomatoes at the store don\'t look ripe, it\'s fine to skip them for this recipe.\nYou can substitute another melting cheese in place of the cheddar, if you want, like Swiss cheese or Monterey jack.\nINGREDIENTS\nButter (for the dish)\n1 loaf sliced white toasting bread\n3/4 pound mild cheddar, grated\n8 small tomatoes, or 16 cherry tomatoes, thinly sliced\n1 thick slice (3/4 pound) flavorful baked ham, cut into 1/4-inch dice (About 2 1/2 cups diced)\n10 large eggs\n3 cups whole milk\nSalt and pepper, to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the bread: Butter a deep 9-by-13-inch baking dish. Cut the bread slices on a diagonal to make large triangles. Fit as many triangles as you can in the bottom of the dish, cutting smaller pieces to wedge between the larger ones, if necessary, to completely cover the bottom.\n2 Begin layering the casserole: Sprinkle the bottom layer of bread with half the cheese. Lay half the tomato slices here and there over top, and sprinkle with half the ham. Add another layer of bread, again cutting smaller pieces, if necessary, to make a solid layer. Sprinkle with all but 2 tablespoons of the remaining cheese, and the remaining tomatoes and ham. Cover with a third layer of bread. (You may have a few slices of bread leftover.)\n3 Whisk together the eggs and milk: In a bowl, beat the eggs, milk, and a generous pinch of salt and pepper. Pour the mixture carefully over the bread. With your hands, press the bread into the egg mixture. Sprinkle the remaining 2 tablespoons cheese over top.\n4 Cover and refrigerate. Refrigerate for at least 12 hours, or for up to 48 hours.\n5 When ready to bake, let the dish sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Heat the oven to 375F. Remove the plastic wrap from the dish and set it on a large rimmed baking sheet to catch any drips.\n6 Bake the casserole for 55 to 60 minutes, or until it is puffed and golden brown and cooked through in the middle.

OR you can use stale bread that is no longer soft. Drying the bread in the oven will help keep it from falling apart when you add the egg mixture later.\n2 Cook the chopped bacon: Place bacon in medium skillet on medium high heat. Cook until bacon is lightly browned and much of the fat rendered. Remove bacon from pan with a slotted spoon, place on a paper towel lined plate to drain. Pour off all but enough bacon fat to coat the bottom of the pan (do not put down the drain, it will clog your pipes).\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions: Add chopped onions to the pan with bacon fat. Cook on medium high heat until lightly browned, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the bacon back to the pan with the onions, stir, remove from heat.\n4 Blanch the asparagus: While the onions are cooking, bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the asparagus and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain and shock the asparagus in ice water to stop the cooking.\n5 Mix eggs, milk, cheese: In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a fork or whisk. Whisk in the milk. Stir in the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir in the grated cheddar cheese.\n6 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n7 Place bread in egg milk mixture, fold in bacon and vegetables: Place the cubed bread in the egg milk mixture and press down with your hands so that the bread cubes absorb most of the egg milk mixture.

b'Print\nBreakfast Casserole with Leeks and Asparagus Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nPro tip: raw bacon is much easier to slice if it is frozen. So keep your bacon chilled until you are ready to cut it, or put it in the freezer for several minutes before slicing.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 slices thick-sliced bacon (about 3 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 pound of asparagus, trimmed of woody ends, cut into 1/2-inch diagonal pieces\n6 slices of bread, cut into 1 1/2 inch wide square pieces, including crusts\n2 leeks, cleaned, cut in half lengthwise, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces, white and light green parts only, about 2 cups total\n2 Tbsp butter, divided 1 Tbsp and 1 Tbsp\n1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese\n8 eggs\n2 cups milk\n1/2 teaspoon of dried herbes de provence (can sub dried tarragon or thyme)\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Place bacon in a medium skillet on medium heat. Gently cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon pieces are lightly browned and much of the bacon fat has been rendered, about 10-12 minutes. Remove cooked bacon from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving the rendered bacon fat in the pan.\n2 While the bacon is cooking, cut up the bread. If the bread is a little stale, great. If it is fresh, then spread it out on a baking sheet and heat it in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for about 10-15 minutes to help it dry out a bit. This will help the keep the bread from disintegrating when mixed with the eggs later.\n3 Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the cut asparagus and blanch for 1 minute. Remove the asparagus from the pot to a bowl of ice water. Let cool in the ice water and then drain.\n4 Once the bacon is done and removed from the pan add a tablespoon of butter to the pan with the remaining bacon fat. Add the leeks and gently cook on medium to medium low heat for 10-12 minutes until the leeks are softened, but not browned. Do not let brown.\n5 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, crumbled feta cheese, herbes de provence, salt, and pepper.\n6 Place the bread pieces into the egg milk mixture and press down so that the bread becomes completely saturated with the mixture. Add the asparagus and leeks and gently mix to combine, taking care to not break up the bread.\n7 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. With the remaining tablespoon of butter, butter the insides of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle the bacon over the bottom of the dish. Gently pour the filling mixture into the casserole. Top with Parmesan cheese. Push the grated Parmesan down a bit into to the top of the casserole so that it gets moistened. (At this point you can make the night before, refrigerate and bake the next morning.)\n8 Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and the custard is cooked through. If the top is getting too brown before the custard is done, you can tent it with foil. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before cutting to serve.\nHello!

b'Print\nSlow Cooker Chocolate Milk French Toast Recipe\nPrep time: 50 minutesCook time: 2 hours, 45 minutesSoaking time: 2 hoursYield: 8 servings\nThe way you slice the bread is important here: cutting it into one-inch cubes is ideal to allow the chocolate milk custard to soak into it fully. \nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound challah, brioche, or sweet Hawaiian bread, cut into 1 to 1 1/2 inch cubes\n2 tablespoons light brown sugar\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1 1/2 teaspoons orange zest (from one small naval orange)\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n5 large eggs\n2 cups whole chocolate milk\n1/2 cup heavy cream\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, softened\n4 ounces (110 grams) semi-sweet chocolate, chopped (or chocolate chips), divided\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toast the challah: Preheat your oven to 300\xc2\xb0F. Arrange the cubes of challah in a single layer on a half sheet pan.\nToast the bread for 15 minutes, tossing once half-way through the toasting time. Remove the pan from the oven and let the bread cool while you prepare the chocolate milk custard.\n2 Mix the custard: In a large mixing bowl, combine the brown sugar, cinnamon, orange zest, salt, and eggs. Whisk the ingredients together until smooth. \nCombine the chocolate milk and heavy cream and add them to the egg mixture. Whisk until the custard is no longer clumpy. \n3 Assemble the casserole: Grease the ceramic insert of your slow cooker with the butter.\nAdd half of the bread cubes to the insert and top with a quarter of the chocolate pieces.\nAdd the remaining bread cubes and sprinkle on another quarter of the chocolate chunks. Reserve the rest of the chocolate for sprinkling on the finished casserole. \n4 Soak the casserole: Pour all of the chocolate milk custard over the bread. Use a large spoon to toss the bread in the custard before covering with the lid and refrigerating for at least 2 or up to 24 hours. \n5 Warm the ceramic insert: Before cooking the casserole, set the ceramic insert on the countertop for 30 minutes to take some of the chill off of it. This will keep it from shattering when it\xe2\x80\x99s heated. \n6 Cook the casserole: Place the insert into the slow cooker and cook the casserole on high for 2 1/2 hours. The internal temperature of the fully-cooked casserole should be 160-165\xc2\xb0F\n7 Cool and serve: Once the casserole is cooked, sprinkle the remaining chocolate chunks over the casserole. Cool briefly, then spoon the casserole into individual plates and serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Do not use quick grits or artisan grits. Quick grits don\xe2\x80\x99t have a good texture, and artisan or heirloom grits can take hours to cook.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups water\n2 cups whole or 2% milk\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 cup grits (I prefer yellow, but white grits are fine)\n2 to 4 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2 cups grated cheddar cheese\n1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1/8 teaspoon black pepper\n1/2 cup thinly sliced scallions or chives, optional\n3 large eggs\n1/2 cup sour cream\nSpecial equipment:\n2-quart casserole or 9 x 13-inch baking dish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the oven: Adjust the oven rack to the middle position. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Cook the grits: In a medium saucepan, bring the water and milk to a boil. Add the salt, then gradually whisk in the grits (this keeps them from clumping). Cook over medium heat, whisking frequently, until creamy and thickened, about 20 minutes.\nRemove from heat. Add the butter, cheese, cayenne, black pepper, and scallions or chives, if using. Switch to a spatula and stir until the butter and cheese are melted. Cover to keep warm and set aside.\n3 Separate the eggs: Separate the egg yolks from the egg whites. Put the whites in a large, grease-free bowl.\nIn a separate, medium bowl, stir the egg yolks and sour cream until combined.\n4 Beat the egg whites: With electric beaters or the largest whisk you have, beat the egg whites until they are fluffy and pillowy-soft, like clouds. They should mostly hold their shape but not be completely stiff.\n5 Stir the yolks into the grits: Working quickly, stir the sour cream and yolk mixture into the grits with a large spatula.\n6 Fold the egg whites into the grits: Push the egg whites to the side of the bowl, and dump the hot grits mixture on the emptier side. Still using the spatula, fold the egg whites into the grits until you see no (or very few) streaks of egg white.\n7 Bake the casserole: Scrape the mixture into the baking dish. Bake until the top is puffy and golden-brown, 35 to 45 minutes. Let sit 5 minutes before serving. Leftovers will keep, covered and refrigerated, for up to 4 days.\nHello!

b'Print\nHome Cured Corned Beef\nPrep time: 5 daysCook time: 3 hours\nThe spice mix with the gallon of brine makes easily enough curing brine for a 5 pound brisket, cured in a somewhat large-ish container. If you were to use a 2-gallon freezer bag or marinating bag, you would likely need just half (or less) of the amount of brine and brine spices.\nPink curing salt, or sodium nitrite, goes by many names, such as Prague Powder #1 or DQ Curing Salt #1, and is available online and may be available at your local specialty market or butcher shop. If you don\'t have it, you can still make corned beef, but it is necessary for that vibrant pink color we associate with corned beef. And it adds flavor too. Without it the corned beef will be a dull grey color.\nNote that pink curing salt is NOT Himalayan pink salt. Pink curing salt is toxic and can be deadly if ingested directly, which is why it is colored pink, so consumers do not mistake it for table salt.\nINGREDIENTS\nPickling spices:\n1 tablespoon whole allspice berries\n1 tablespoon whole mustard seeds (brown or yellow)\n1 tablespoon coriander seeds\n1 tablespoon red pepper flakes\n1 tablespoon whole black peppercorns\n2 teaspoons whole cloves\n9 whole cardamom pods\n6 large bay leaves, crumbled\n2 teaspoons ground ginger\n1/2 stick cinnamon\nBrine:\n1 gallon (3.8 liters) water\n300 g Kosher salt (2 cups of Diamond Crystal brand Kosher Salt OR 1 cup 3 1/2 tablespoons of Morton\'s Kosher Salt)\n5 teaspoons pink curing salt (optional, see Recipe Note)\n3 tablespoons pickling spices\n1/2 cup (90 g) brown sugar\nBrisket:\n1 5-pound beef brisket\n1 tablespoon pickling spices\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toast and crush spices: You can either used store-bought pickling spices or you can make your own. To make your own, toast the allspice berries, mustard seeds, coriander seeds, red pepper flakes, peppercorns, cloves, and cardamom pods in a small frying pan on medium heat until fragrant. Note that it is pretty easy to burn spices; you want enough heat to release their flavors, not so much that they get burned.\nRemove from heat and place in a small bowl. Use a mortar and pestle to crush the spices a little (or the back of a spoon or the side of a knife on a flat surface). Add to a small bowl and stir in the crumbled bay leaves and ground ginger.\n2 Make curing brine: Add about 3 Tbsp of the spice mix (reserve the rest for cooking the corned beef after it has cured), plus the half stick of cinnamon, to a gallon of water in a large pot, along with the Kosher salt, pink salt (if using), and brown sugar. Bring to a boil, then remove from heat and let cool to room temperature. Then refrigerate until well chilled.\n3 Brine the brisket for 5-7 days: Place the brisket in a large, flat container or pan, and cover with the brine. The brine should cover the meat. The meat may float in which case you may want to weigh it down with a plate.\nAlternatively you can use a 2-gallon freezer bag (placed in a container so if it leaks it doesn\'t leak all over your refrigerator), place the brisket in the freezer bag and about 2 quarts of brine, squeezing out the air from the bag before sealing.\nPlace in the refrigerator and chill from 5-7 days. Every day flip the brisket over, so that all sides get brined equally.\n4 Cook the corned beef: At the end of the cure, remove the brisket from the brine and rinse off the brine with cold water. Place the brisket in a large pot that just fits around the brisket and cover with at least one inch of water. If you want your brisket less salty, add another inch of water to the pot.\nAdd a tablespoon of the pickling spices to the pot. Bring to a boil, reduce to a very low simmer (barely bubbling), and cook 3-4 hours, until the corned beef is fork tender. (At this point you can store in the fridge for up to a week.)\n5 Cut across the grain: Remove the meat to a cutting board. (You can use the spiced cooking liquid to cook vegetables for boiled dinner or corned beef and cabbage.) Notice the visible lines on the meat; this is the "grain" of the meat, or the direction of the muscle fibers.\nTo make the meat easier to cut, cut it first in half, along the grain of the meat. Then make thin crosswise cuts, across the grain to cut the meat to serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Print\nNew England Boiled Dinner Recipe\nCook time: 4 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nCorned beef can be pretty salty, so if you are making boiled dinner with corned beef you may want to put it in a pot, cover with cold water, bring to a boil, and then discard the water before starting the recipe. If the broth ends up being too salty, you can serve just the meat and vegetables, without the broth, or add water to the broth to dilute it.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 1/2 pounds corned beef brisket or plain beef brisket\n15 peppercorns\n8 whole cloves\n1 bay leaf\nSalt, if using plain brisket\n2 medium sized turnips, peeled and quartered\n4 red new potatoes, peeled and quartered\n3 large carrots, cut into thirds and the thickest pieces quartered lengthwise\n1 small head cabbage, cut into fourths\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Put corned beef in a pot, cover with water, add seasonings, simmer: Put the brisket in a 5 or 6 quart Dutch oven and cover with an inch of water.\nIf you are using corned beef brisket and it does not come already packed in seasoning, add peppercorns, cloves, and a bay leaf to the pot.\nIf using plain brisket, add a teaspoon of salt for every quart of water.\nBring to a simmer and then cover, lower the heat until it is barely simmering. Keep at a low simmer for four hours or until the meat is tender (a fork goes through easily).\n2 Remove meat, add vegetables, simmer: Remove the meat and set aside, keeping the meat warm. Add the vegetables to the pot. Check the broth for taste. If it is too salty, add a little more water to taste.\nRaise the temperature and bring the soup to a high simmer. Cook at a high simmer until done, about 15-30 minutes longer, depending on the size of the cut of your vegetables.\n\n3 Slice meat across the grain: Slice the meat in thin slices across the grain. You may find it easier to slice if you first cut the roast in half along the same direction as the grain of the meat. Then slice smaller lengths across the grain.\n\nServe in bowls, a few pieces of meat in each, add some of the vegetables and some broth. Serve with horseradish or mustard or both.\nHello!

Add the brisket and spread the BBQ sauce mixture generously over meat. Wrap the brisket in the aluminum foil so it's well sealed, like a package.\nBake for 3 hours for a 3 pound roast and 1 more hour for every additional pound of meat.\nOR, instead of foil, you can use an oven roasting bag:\nOven roasting bag method: Place the barbecue sauce and the brisket in an oven roasting bag. Sprinkle a teaspoon of flour into the bag. Poke a couple small holes in the bag. Place the bag in a roasting pan. You may find that the cooking time is faster with this method, or you can reduce the oven temperature to 275\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Let the brisket rest: Remove from oven and let rest in the foil for 30 minutes before serving.\n5 Slice across the grain of the meat: The easiest way to serve the roast is to first cut it in half along the grain of the meat (poke the meat with the tip of a knife or tines of a fork to see which way the grain or lines of the muscles are going if you can't see it from the surface).\nThen make 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch thick cuts across the grain to serve. (Cutting the meat across the grain will make it much easier to eat, as the cuts break up the muscle tissue.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nBeef Brisket Pot Roast Recipe\nPrep time: 35 minutesCook time: 4 hours, 15 minutesYield: Serves 8-12\nINGREDIENTS\n4 to 5 pound (about 2 kg) beef brisket, flat cut or point cut\nSalt\n1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n3 large onions, sliced\n5 to 6 garlic cloves, minced\n1 sprig thyme\n1 sprig rosemary\n3 to 4 bay leaves\n2 cups beef stock\n2 to 3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces\n1 tablespoon mustard (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the brisket: On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.\nUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.\nSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n2 Sear the brisket: You\'ll need an ovenproof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\nPat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\nTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot. If not, add some olive oil.\nAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Saut\xc3\xa9, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1 to 2 more minutes.\n4 Simmer the brisket and roast it: Preheat the oven to 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C). Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.\nMove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop. Cover the pot, then place in the 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C) oven. Cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.\n5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\n6 Remove brisket: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.\n7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.\nTo make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into a blender, and pur\xc3\xa9e until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.\n8 Slice and serve: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the "grain" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices. (A sturdy bread knife works great for slicing roasts.)\nServe with the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles, or polenta.\nHello!

b'Print\nInstant Pot Beef Brisket Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesYield: 6 to 8 servings\nOven-cooking Instructions: Using a Dutch oven or other heavy pot with a lid placed over medium-high heat, follow the instructions for searing the brisket, cooking the onions, and mixing in the other ingredients as described in the pressure cooker recipe. Make sure the fat cap is facing up when you add the brisket back to the pan. Cover the pot and transfer to a 325F oven to cook for 3 hours, until the brisket is tender.\nMake-ahead Instructions: Cook the brisket as indicated, allow it to cool, and refrigerate on its own. Refrigerate the strained onions and garlic separately. Transfer the cooking liquid to a storage container and refrigerate separately. The next day, scrape the solidified fat from the top of the liquid and discard. Warm the cooking liquid, onions, and garlic in the pressure cooker or in a medium saucepan. With an immersion blender or in a blender, blend the cooking liquid, onions and garlic into a thick gravy. Warm the brisket in the gravy before serving.\n  INGREDIENTS\n2 1/2 to 3 1/2 pounds beef brisket (certified kosher, if needed)\n1 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt, divided\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n3 medium yellow onions, sliced\n3 large garlic cloves, peeled\n1/2 cup water\n1/2 cup dry red wine\n1/4 cup ketchup\n1 teaspoon dried rosemary\n1 teaspoon dried thyme leaves\n1 teaspoon paprika\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart electric or stovetop pressure cooker, or larger (like an Instant Pot)\nImmersion blender, or regular blender\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the brisket: Rinse the brisket and pat it dry with paper towels. If your brisket has more than 1/4-inch layer of fat, trim off the excess. Season it on both sides with 1 teaspoon of the salt and the ground pepper.\n2 Sear the brisket: Select the \xe2\x80\x9cSaut\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d program on your pressure cooker, adjust it to its highest heat setting, and add the oil to the pot. (If you are using a stovetop pressure cooker, heat the oil over medium high heat.)\nUse a pair of tongs to lower the brisket into the pot with the side with the most fat facing down, and let it sear for 6 minutes. Turn it over and sear it for 6 more minutes. Both sides should be a rich, dark brown color.\nTransfer the seared brisket to a plate.\n3 Cook the onions and garlic: Adjust your pressure cooker to its medium "Saut\xc3\xa9" setting. (If you are using a stovetop pressure cooker, lower the heat to medium.) There should be plenty of fat left in the pan after searing the brisket; if not, add another teaspoon or two of olive oil to cook the onions.\nAdd the onions, garlic, and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onions are soft and beginning to brown, about 10 minutes. Scrape the bottom of the pot as you stir the onions to help release all of the browned bits from the bottom of the pot.\n4 Stir the water, wine, ketchup, and spices into the onions and garlic.\n5 Cook the brisket: Use a pair of tongs to lower the seared brisket back into the pressure cooker, with the side with the most fat facing up. Place the lid on your pressure cooker. Make sure that the pressure regulator is set to the \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d position.\nSelect the \xe2\x80\x9cManual\xe2\x80\x9d program, then set the time to 50 minutes at high pressure. (For stovetop pressure cookers, cook for 45 minutes at high pressure.)\nIt will take about 10 minutes for your pressure cooker to come up to pressure, and then the actual cooking will begin. Total time from the time you seal the pressure cooker to the finished dish is about 60 minutes.\n6 Release the pressure: You can either perform a quick pressure release by moving the vent from \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cVenting,\xe2\x80\x9d or you can let the pot depressurize naturally (this takes about 20 minutes). (For stovetop pressure cookers, perform a quick pressure release.)\n7 Separate the brisket, onions, and cooking liquid: Use tongs to transfer the brisket to a plate or carving board. Strain the cooking liquid into a fat separator, collecting the cooked onions and garlic in the strainer.\n8 Make the gravy: Return the drained onions and garlic to the pressure cooker pot. Pour the cooking liquid from the fat separator back into the pot, discarding the fat that is left behind. (If you don\'t have a fat separator, wait for the fat to rise to the top of the liquid, then skim off as much as you can.)\nWith an immersion blender, blend the cooking liquid, onions and garlic into a thick gravy. (Alternatively, transfer the liquid, onions, and garlic to a blender to puree. Don\'t fill the blender more than halfway, and be careful of the steam when opening the blender pitcher.\n9 To serve: Slice the brisket against the grain into thin (1/4-inch) slices. Pour the gravy over the brisket and serve hot.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'
b"Print\nChicken Tikka Masala Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nLeftover chicken tikka masala tastes phenomenal the next day because the spices develop more flavor overnight.\nAvoid using Greek yogurt if possible for this recipe. If it's all you can find, buy the Greek yogurt with the highest fat content you can find and mix it with a little whole milk to get the consistency of regular yogurt. This will give the sauce some insurance against separating.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the chicken:\n1 1/4 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, thighs, or a mix\n6 tablespoons plain whole milk yogurt\n1/2 tablespoon grated ginger\n3 cloves of garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon cumin\n1 teaspoon paprika\n1 1/4 teaspoons salt\nFor the tikka masala sauce:\n2 tablespoons canola oil, divided\n1 small onion, thinly sliced (about 5 ounces, or 1 1/2 cups sliced)\n2 teaspoons grated ginger\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tablespoon ground coriander\n2 teaspoons paprika\n1 teaspoon garam masala\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 (14-ounce) can crushed fire-roasted tomatoes (regular crushed tomatoes work, too)\n6 tablespoons plain whole milk yogurt\n1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nCooked rice, to serve\nCilantro, to garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the chicken: Trim chicken thighs of any extra fat. Chop into bite-sized pieces about 1/2 to 1-inch wide. Place the chicken thigh pieces to a medium bowl.\nAdd the yogurt, ginger, garlic, cumin, paprika and salt. Using your hands, combine the chicken with the spices until the chicken is evenly coated.\n2 Marinate the chicken: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the chicken marinate in the fridge for at least 45 minutes or as long as overnight. (Marinating for 4 to 6 hours is perfect.)\n3 Cook the chicken: In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thigh pieces and cook for about 6 to 7 minutes, until they\xe2\x80\x99re cooked through. Transfer to a plate and set aside.\n4 Toast the spices: Wipe down the pan you used to cook the chicken. Heat remaining canola oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes, until softened, stirring often.\nAdd the grated ginger, minced garlic, coriander, paprika, garam masala, turmeric, black pepper, salt, and cayenne. Let the spices cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds to a minute.\n5 Make the sauce: Add the crushed tomatoes to the pan with the spices and let everything cook for 4 minutes, stirring often. Add the yogurt and stir to combine.\n6 Simmer the sauce: Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the sauce simmer for another 4 minutes. Add the chicken pieces to the pan and coat with sauce.\n7 Serve: Serve over cooked basmati rice and garnish with cilantro.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Then whisk in most of the milk.\n3 Make a well in the middle of the flour and pour in the milk egg mixture. Whisk until smooth, adding more milk until you get the right consistency - thin enough to spread on the pan, but not so thin as to run. Fold in the melted butter.\n4 Heat a griddle or large cast iron pan on medium to medium low heat. Coat the pan with a little butter, spreading it with a folded over paper towel. Drop large spoonfuls of batter on the griddle to form pancakes. When bubbles start to appear on the surface (after 2 to 3 minutes), use a metal spatula to flip the pancakes over.

They will do this free of charge.\nINGREDIENTS\n6 tablespoons olive oil, or more if needed\n2 1/2 pounds Yukon Gold or other yellow potatoes (3 large or 6 medium), unpeeled\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 cup Panko, or other unseasoned dry white breadcrumbs\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 pounds firm-fleshed white fish fillets, skins removed, such as haddock, halibut, pollock, flounder, whiting, redfish, cod, or other fish in your region\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley\n1 lemon, cut into wedges, to serve\nTartar sauce, to serve\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the oven to 450F. Arrange 2 oven racks in the top and bottom third of the oven. Line 2 baking sheets with foil and coat with olive oil (about 1 tablespoon per baking sheet) or with nonstick cooking spray.\n2 Prepare the potatoes: Quarter the potatoes lengthwise, then cut each quarter in half again so you get 8 spears from each potato. In a bowl, toss the potatoes with 2 tablespoons of the oil and 1/2 teaspoon salt. Spread the potatoes on one of the baking sheets with their wedges pointing up, if possible, so the cut sides are exposed (some may not stand; that\xe2\x80\x99s OK).\n3 Roast the potatoes: Roast the spears on the lower rack in the oven for 40 minutes. Rotate the pan partway through (after 20 minutes of cooking) and use a wide metal spatula to stir the potatoes. At this point, it\'s fine if the potatoes fall on their sides; the sides touching the pan will become extra-crispy and golden.\n4 Toast the panko: Once the potatoes are in the oven, start on the panko and the fish. To toast the panko, warm a heavy skillet over medium high heat. Add the panko (no oil needed), and lower the heat to medium. Slowly toast the panko, stirring frequently, for 10 to 15 minutes or until a deep golden brown.\nRemove the skillet from heat. Stir 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and 1/2 teaspoon black pepper into the panko breadcrumbs until they are well coated. Transfer the crumbs to a shallow bowl.\n5 Prepare the fish: Cut the fish into large strips ("fingers") or big 3-inch pieces, however you prefer. Rub all the pieces with the remaining tablespoon of olive oil.\n6 Coat the fish with panko: Press the fish into the panko so the pieces are coated all over. Set the fish on the second baking sheet, spaced slightly apart.\n7 When the potatoes are 15 to 20 minutes away from being done, bake the fish:  Cook thick (2-inch) fish fillets for 15 to 18 minutes and thinner (1 1/2-inch or thinner) fillets for 10 to 13 minutes, or until the fish is firm and the coating is starting to brown. Err on the side of caution and do not over-bake.\n7 Serve the fish and chips: Arrange fish and potato spears on plates, sprinkle with parsley, serve with lemon and tartar sauce.\nHello!

Rub sheet pan with 1 tablespoon of olive oil to prevent the food from sticking.\n2 Begin cooking the sausage: Arrange sausage links on the sheet pan and cook for 15 minutes.\n3 Flip the sausage and add the tomatoes: Remove sheet pan from the oven and using tongs. Add the grape tomatoes, cut side up and season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Return to oven and bake for another 15 minutes.\n4 Meanwhile, prep the remaining ingredients. Toss the mushrooms with 1 tablespoon olive oil and a pinch of salt and pepper, and set aside. Drain and rinse pinto beans and stir them together with brown sugar, ketchup, and barbecue sauce. Transfer beans to a small oven-safe skillet or dish.\n5 Pour off liquid and add the mushrooms. Remove the sheet pan from the oven (at this point, the sausages have been cooking for 30 minutes and the tomatoes for 15 minutes). If there is a lot of liquid on the sheet pan, carefully pour off the liquid; do not stir the tomatoes (they tend to fall apart if stirred and are better left alone).\nAdd prepared mushrooms to the sheet pan and return to the oven.\n6 Add the beans and the eggs. After 15 more minutes (40-45 total minutes of baking), remove the sheet pan and again drain off any excess liquid. Flip the sausages again, but the other ingredients can be left alone.\nClear a little space on the sheet pan and nestle the dish of beans inside. (Alternatively, if you\xe2\x80\x99re running out of space, you can bake the beans on a separate oven rack.)\nMake four little pockets of space on the sheet pan for the eggs. Drizzle a tiny amount of oil in each area and crack in eggs. Place the fresh thyme sprigs here and there over the ingredients.\n7 Bake the eggs: Bake for a final 5 minutes, just until the whites of the eggs set.

The cream should steam, but not boil. Set this aside.\nIn a 4-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the salt, brown sugar, and corn syrup. Whisking frequently, heat until the sugar has dissolved and the syrup bubbles gently. This should take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes.\nTurn the stove off and whisk in the warmed cream\xe2\x80\x94be careful, as the sugar will bubble and steam once the cream is poured in. Add the vanilla extract to the sauce and set the pan back over medium heat.\nCook for another 5 minutes, or until the syrup is thick. Transfer the sauce to a glass jar and store in the refrigerator until ready to use, up to one week in advance.\n2 Prep the oven and the pan: Preheat your oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Wrap a 10-inch springform pan in heavy duty aluminum foil and set aside; be very careful not to tear or puncture the foil.\n3 Make the shortbread crust: Use a food processor to pulse the shortbread cookies into fine crumbs. Add 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and the melted butter to the food processor bowl and pulse until the crumbs hold together.\nSqueeze a handful of crumbs in the palm of your hand. If the mixture doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold together, add another tablespoon of melted butter, and re-mix.\n4 Pre-bake the crust: Press the shortbread mixture onto the bottom and an inch or so up the sides of the springform pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and allow it to cool while you prepare the cheesecake filling.\n5 Heat water: While the crust bakes, heat 4 or 5 cups of water to boiling for the water bath.\n6 Prepare the banana cheesecake: In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment (or in a large mixing bowl), blend together the cream cheese, the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, and the salt until smooth.\nAdd the eggs, one at a time, to the cream cheese mixture, stopping to scrape down the sides after each addition. Mix on low speed for an additional minute.\nAdd the banana puree and both extracts. Blend on low for another minute. Scrape down the mixing bowl and add the cornstarch. Blend on the lowest speed for 30 seconds, or until no lumps of cornstarch are visible, being careful not to over-mix. \n7 Bake the cheesecake: Pour the batter into the prepared pan and set the foil-wrapped springform pan into a larger pan. Add enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the springform pan and carefully place the pan into the oven.\nBake the cheesecake for 55 minutes to an 1 hour, or until the top is a light golden brown and the cheesecake jiggles slightly when shaken. Turn the oven off and open the door a crack to allow the cheesecake to cool in the oven for 30 minutes.\n8 Cool the cheesecake completely: Once the cheesecake has cooled in the oven, carefully take it out of the oven and remove the foil. Cool the cheesecake on the countertop for an hour, then transfer it to the refrigerator to cool completely, at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours.\n9 Decorate the cheesecake: Once the cheesecake is cold, remove the collar from the springform pan. Warm the toffee sauce slightly so that it's pourable but not runny (I set it in a dish of warm water), then drizzle one cup of the toffee sauce over the top of the cheesecake. Use a piping bag to pipe rosettes of whipped cream around the cheesecake and garnish each rosette with a banana chip.\nKeep the cheesecake refrigerated until ready to serve, and be sure to keep leftovers chilled, too.\nHello!

b"Print\nSesame Brittle Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 10 minutesYield: Makes about 10 ounces of brittle\nAdding a small amount of baking soda to the hot mixture right before pouring it out will cause the mixture to foam up a bit, as the baking soda reacts with the acid from the caramelization of the sugar. This creates bubbles of carbon dioxide which helps produce a slightly lighter, more porous texture for the brittle, making it easier to eat.\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4 cup sugar\n1/4 cup honey\nPinch of salt\n1/4 teaspoon of ground nutmeg\n1 Tbsp water\n1 cup raw sesame seeds\n1 teaspoon of vanilla extract\n2 teaspoons butter\n1/4 teaspoon of baking soda\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat sugar, honey, water, salt, nutmeg: Put the sugar, honey, salt, nutmeg, and water into a small (1 1/2 quart), thick-bottomed saucepan. Heat on medium heat and stir until a smooth slurry is formed.\n2 Stir in the raw sesame seeds.\n3 Cook the sesame seed mixture, stirring often, until the mixture turns an amber caramel color, about 5 to 10 minutes.\nIf you have a candy thermometer, the temp should be 300\xc2\xb0F. At this point, remove the pan from the heat. Stir in the vanilla extract and the butter.\nOnce the butter has completely melted into the mixture, stir in the baking soda. The mixture will foam up a bit after you stir in the baking soda, as the baking soda reacts with the acid from the caramelization of the sugar.\n4 Pour the mixture out onto a Silpat-lined baking sheet. (If you don't have Silpat, no worries, pour directly onto a buttered metal baking sheet and use a metal spatula to separate brittle from the pan once cooled.)\n5 Once completely cooled and hardened (about 15-20 minutes), break into pieces.\nHello!

b'Print\nBeef and Broccoli Ramen Stir Fry Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: 4 servings\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the stir fry sauce:\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger\n1/3 cup soy sauce\n1/4 cup honey\n1/4 cup hoisin sauce\n3/4 cup beef broth\n2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n2 tablespoons sesame oil\n2 tablespoons cornstarch\nFor the stir fry:\n2 (3-ounce) packages dried ramen noodles, seasoning packets discarded\n2 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n1 pound sirloin steak, trimmed of fat and sliced into 1/4-inch thick strips\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n3 cups fresh broccoli florets\nSesame seeds, garnish\nSriracha, garnish (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\n12-inch anodized wok\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the stir fry sauce: Add garlic and ginger to a bowl and whisk in soy sauce through sesame oil. Whisk in cornstarch last, and try to whisk out as many lumps as possible. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if there are a few lumps, as they will cook out when you add the sauce to the skillet.\nThis makes a lot, because I like this dish to be very saucy. You could halve the recipe if you like a drier stir fry. If you have leftover sauce, it stores well in the fridge for a week in an airtight container or jar.\n2 Prepare the noodles: Cook dry ramen noodles in boiling water until they are tender, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain the noodles and rinse with cold water to stop them from cooking.\n3 Cook the stir fry: In a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Season the steak with 1/2 teaspoon salt and pepper.\nOnce the skillet is glistening hot, add the steak strips. Cook for about 3 minutes, undisturbed, to allow them to sear well on one side. Then stir and continue to cook for 2 to 3 more minutes, until the steak is cooked through.\nRemove the steak from skillet, and add another tablespoon of olive oil and the broccoli florets. Add 1/2 cup of water to the skillet and cover. Steam broccoli for 2 minutes. Broccoli should be bright green and tender, and not mushy at all.\nAdd the steak back to the skillet, along with cooked and rinsed noodles. Pour in all of the sauce. (If you prefer a drier stir fry, you can start with half the sauce.) Use tongs or a large rubber spatula to stir together ingredients as sauce cooks. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes until sauce thickens.\n5 Serve: Serve stir fry immediately, garnished with sesame seeds and, optionally, sriracha.\nHello!

You can use vegetable peeler to peel them, then slice and eat like celery.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds (900g) broccoli, stems removed (can use vegetable peeler to peel, then slice and eat like celery) and crowns cut into florets (about 8 cups of broccoli florets)\n2 strips thick-cut bacon (about 2 ounces), cut crosswise into 1/4-inch wide strips\n5 large eggs, beaten\n1/3 cup (43g) all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup (118 ml) heavy cream\n1 cup (236 ml) whole milk\n2 to 3 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper (1 to 2 teaspoons if using fine ground black pepper)\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\n8 ounces (225g) cheddar cheese, grated\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Blanch the broccoli florets: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 Tbsp salt for 2 quarts of water). Add the broccoli florets and boil for 3-5 minutes or until just tender enough so that a fork can easily pierce the floret, but still firm. Strain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.\n2 Cook the bacon: While the water in step one is coming to a boil, cook the bacon pieces on medium heat in a frying pan until lightly browned, but not crisp. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess fat. Set aside.\n3 Make the egg mixture: Preheat oven to 425\xc2\xb0F (220\xc2\xb0C). Butter a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish. In a bowl, whisk the eggs into the flour, then whisk in the cream and milk. Add the black pepper (more or less to taste), salt, and mustard. Mix in about a third of the cheese.\n4 Assemble the casserole: Place the blanched broccoli florets in the casserole dish, sprinkling about a third of the cheese over the broccoli florets as you lay them down. Sprinkle the bacon pieces over the broccoli.\nPour the egg, cream, milk, cheese mixture over the broccoli, moving the broccoli pieces a bit so that the mixture gets into all the nooks and crannies. Sprinkle the casserole with the remaining cheese.\n5 Bake for 25 to 40 minutes, or until set. Once the top has browned, you may want to tent with aluminum foil to keep from burning.\nHello!

Add broccoli stalks and blanch for 2 to 3 minutes until they are bright green and fork tender, but still slightly crispy.\nDrain broccoli. Scoop out and set aside about 1 cup of the florets for the topping.\n2 Cook the onions and carrots: Wipe out the pot, place over medium heat, and melt the butter. Once melted, add the onions and carrots, and cook until veggies soften, 4 to 5 minutes, stirring regularly.\n3 Cook the soup: Stir in the all-purpose flour. The flour will form a paste with the veggies. Cook for a minute or two to coat the vegetables, and then start to slowly pour in vegetable stock. Stir constantly as you pour in the stock to avoid lumps.\nOnce all the stock is added, bring soup up to a low simmer. Add milk and the blanched broccoli (except what you're saving for the topping). Simmer for about 10 minutes over low heat.\n4 Puree the soup: Blend with an immersion blender, or let the soup cool until no longer steaming and blend in batches in a blender. (If using a blender, be careful to let the soup cool a bit and do not overfill the blender to avoid splattered hot soup!)\n5 Season to taste and serve: Add the grated cheese, salt, and pepper to the pureed soup and stir over low heat until the cheese has melted. Taste soup and season with additional salt and pepper to your liking.\nLadle the soup into bowls and garnish with some reserved broccoli and extra cheese on top. Serve with bread.\nHello!

Salt it well. It should taste like the sea. Fill a large bowl with ice water. Boil the broccoli for 1 minute.\nAdd the asparagus and boil another minute. Add the snow peas and boil for 30 more seconds.\nRemove all the vegetables and plunge them into the ice water. Once they\xe2\x80\x99re cool, drain in a colander.\nIf you want, you can boil your pasta in the same pot you boiled the vegetables in, or you can start over and boil new water; I use the same water.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 zucchini and garlic, then add tomatoes: In a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan, heat the butter over medium-high heat. When the butter is hot, add the garlic and zucchini and saut\xc3\xa9 1 minute.\nAdd the diced tomatoes and saut\xc3\xa9 another 2 minutes, stirring often.\n3 Add broth, cream, blanched vegetables, peas: Pour in the chicken or vegetable broth and turn the heat to high to bring it to a boil.\nAdd the cream and toss in all the vegetables you boiled, plus the peas. Stir to combine.\nTurn the heat down until the cream-chicken broth mixture is just simmering, not boiling.\n4 Add Parmesan: Add the Parmesan cheese and stir to combine. If the sauce seems too thick \xe2\x80\x93 it should be pretty thick, but not gloppy \xe2\x80\x93 add some more chicken broth, cream or water.\n5 Boil the angel hair pasta: If you are using spaghetti, you will want to start cooking it before you begin saut\xc3\xa9ing the garlic and zucchini. Angel hair will only need 1-2 minutes to cook, vermicelli or spaghetti can take 8-12 minutes.\n6 Transfer cooked pasta to sauce and vegetables: As soon as the pasta is done, transfer it with tongs into the sauce and stir to combine.\nAdd the basil now, and taste for salt. Add salt if needed. Grind some black pepper over everything and serve immediately.\nYou will want a dry white wine with this, ideally a dry French white.\nHello!

Then add the mayonnaise and pulse until blended.\n3 Assemble the salad: Place grated broccoli stalks, carrots, cabbage, the onions, dried cranberries, orange zest, and Kosher salt into a bowl.\nAdd the dressing and toss to combine, until the dressing is evenly distributed.\nYou can make this several hours ahead of time before serving. Keep refrigerated until ready to serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'
b"Print\nSous Vide Chicken and Broccoli Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 2 hoursYield: 4 to 6 servings\nIf you are cooking the chicken from frozen, add thirty minutes onto the cooking time. You can cook the broccoli for an extra thirty minutes as well without any harm.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 medium chicken breasts (6 to 8 ounces each)\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n1 lemon, sliced thin\n1 1/2 pounds broccoli florets\n2 teaspoons sesame oil\n1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes\nPinch of Kosher, sea or table salt\nSpecial equipment:\nSous vide immersion circulator\nGallon-sized zip-top plastic freezer bags\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the water: Fill a pot with water and place your immersion circulator inside. Set the temperature to 158\xc2\xb0F and let the water come up to temperature.\n2 Prep the chicken: Season the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, and place them in gallon-sized zip-top freezer bag with the lemon arranged over top.\nMake sure the chicken is in a single layer. If you need to use two bags, that\xe2\x80\x99s better than having overlapping chicken pieces.\n3 Seal the bag: Seal the bag with as little air as possible by using water-displacement method to press out all the air: Just slowly lower the bag with the chicken into the water, letting the pressure of the water press the air out of the bag. Once the top of the bag reaches the water line and all the air has been pressed out, seal the bag. (Read more here.)\nYou can do this in the pot of water as it heats. (Just be careful if the water is already steaming!)\nSet the chicken aside on a kitchen towel until the water has finished heating. At this point you can also freeze the bag if you want to store the prepared chicken for later.\n4 Prepare the broccoli: Place the florets in a gallon-sized zip-top freezer bag, and season with red pepper flakes and sesame oil. To weight the broccoli down, add a few heavy soup spoons to the bag (or plan to place a heavy bowl over the top of the water bath to keep the broccoli submerged).\nUse the same water displacement technique to seal the broccoli bag.\n5 Cook the broccoli and chicken. Once the water has come to temperature, add the chicken and broccoli to the water and cook for 2 hours. Make sure your cooking bags are completely submerged in the water; place a heavy bowl over the pot if the spoons aren't keeping the broccoli submerged.\nI also like to rotate all the bags halfway through cooking to make sure they are cooking evenly, as sometimes they can get jostled around in the water.\nWhen cooking time ends, remove from the water and turn off the circulator.\n   6 Serve the chicken: Remove the chicken and broccoli and portion in lunch-sized portions or serve for dinner.\nHello!

b'Print\nGrilled Pizza with Red Peppers, Broccoli, and Onions Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: 2 12-inch pizzas, or 4 6-inch pizzas\nThe prep time reflects using store-bought dough and sauce.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 (1-pound) ball pizza dough, store-bought or homemade\nOlive oil for saut\xc3\xa9ing vegetables, and coating and brushing the dough\n1/2 cup sliced red onions\n1/2 bell pepper, thinly sliced\nKosher salt and freshly ground pepper to taste\n1/2 cup chopped broccoli\n1/2 cup sliced black olives\nCoarsely ground cornmeal or flour for rolling and stretching the dough\n1 cup tomato sauce, store-bought or homemade\n2 cups (8 ounces) shredded mozzarella cheese, preferably fresh\n1/4 cup slivered fresh basil leaves (optional)\nMETHOD\n1 Divide and rest the dough: Divide the dough in half and gently shape into two balls. Gently coat each with olive oil and allow the dough to come to room temperature for about an hour, either in a large bowl or on the counter covered with a dishtowel.\n2 Prep the toppings: Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a large skillet with a lid over medium heat.  Add the onions and peppers, season with salt and pepper, and saut\xc3\xa9 for 6 minutes, until tender and lightly browned.\nAdd the chopped broccoli and saut\xc3\xa9 for another minute. Add 2 tablespoons water, and cover the pan with a lid. Cook for 1 minute, then remove the lid, and saut\xc3\xa9 for another minute or two until the broccoli is just tender and the water has evaporated. Stir in the olives and transfer the vegetables to a plate.\n3 Shape the pizza rounds: Sprinkle a lightly oiled baking sheet with cornmeal or flour. Use two baking sheets if you want more space or are making multiple pizzas. Gently begin to stretch or roll each ball into a 12-inch circle, or a rectangle shape.\nYou will need to stretch or roll it a bit, give it a few minutes to relax, and then continue to stretch it so that it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t keep springing back into a smaller shape, which is easier to do when your dough is at room temperature. The goal is about to get it about 1/4 inch thick (it will puff up on the grill). Give it one final stretch and don\xe2\x80\x99t worry if it\xe2\x80\x99s unevenly shaped.\n4 Heat the grill and gather your toppings: Heat a gas or charcoal grill to medium heat. Put your sauce in a small bowl, and bring that along with a brush, grill tongs, a grill spatula, the cheese, the dough, and the vegetables out to the grill.\n5 Grill the dough on the first side: Brush the top of the shaped pizza rounds with olive oil, and with a swift motion, pick up one round of the dough by one edge and flip it, oiled-side down, onto the grill. Repeat with the other round of dough.\nClose the lid and don\xe2\x80\x99t open it for 2 minutes, so the dough can rise a bit and firm up. Open the lid, peek underneath the dough using tongs, and check to see that it\xe2\x80\x99s firm on the bottom (no wet dough), lifts easily, and has some light grill marks.\nLightly brush the unbaked tops of the crusts with olive oil, and then flip them over to the other side.\n6 Immediately add the sauce and toppings: Carefully brush the surface of each crust with the sauce. Sprinkle the cheese evenly over the tops followed by the toppings.\nClose the lid and cook for 4 minutes. Lift the lid and check the pizzas: the cheese should be completely melted and the crust should have a nicely browned underside and barely bend when you lift it with tongs.\n7  Serve the pizzas: Remove the pizza from the grill with a large spatula, sprinkle with the fresh basil if using Let it sit for 1 to 2 minutes for the cheese to firm up slightly before cutting it into pieces.\nHello!

Separate the stalk from the head\xe2\x80\x94where the stalk starts to branch. Peel the stalk with a vegetable peeler and slice it into 3- to 4-inch sticks. Cut the crown lengthwise into 3 to 4 pieces.\n4 Roast the broccoli: Mound the broccoli in the center of the baking sheet. Sprinkle with the oil, salt, and pepper and use your hands to massage the oil over the broccoli.\nSpread the oiled broccoli on the baking sheet in one layer. Roast in the oven for 15 minutes, stirring and flipping the veggies halfway through. Remove the broccoli from the oven and turn the temperature down to 425\xc2\xbaF.\n5 Roast the salmon: Make space on the baking sheet for the salmon, and place the salmon on the sheet with the skin side down. Sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper. Use a butter knife to spread the miso butter over the fillets.\nRoast the salmon and broccoli together for 10 minutes longer, or until a thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the salmon registers 135\xc2\xbaF. Remove from the oven.\n6 Finish under the broiler. Move an oven rack close (3- to 4-inches) to the broiler and turn on the broiler. If necessary, spread the now-softened miso butter evenly over the fillets, and broil for 1 to 2 minutes, or until the fillets are charred at the edges.\nRemove and let the salmon rest for 5 minutes.

Lay the bacon strips on the wire rack perpendicular to the wires, making sure the bacon pieces don\xe2\x80\x99t overlap.\n2 Bake the bacon and scrub the potatoes: Place the bacon in a cold oven and set the temperature to 375\xc2\xb0F. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Check the bacon around the 18-minute mark. Some types of bacon cook faster than others. (See How to Make Bacon in the Oven for full details.)\nWhile the bacon bakes, scrub potatoes well and then stab each potato about 10 times with a fork to prevent the possibility of a potato exploding in the oven. (It can happen!)\nRemove the bacon from the oven; transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\n3 Bake the potatoes: Increase the heat to 400\xcb\x9aF. Place potatoes on a baking sheet, drizzle well with olive oil, and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake potatoes for about an hour until the skins are shriveled slightly and the potatoes are very tender. (See How to Bake a Potato for more details.)\n4 Blanch the broccoli: While the potatoes bake, cook your broccoli. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a big pinch of salt to the water to season it. Add broccoli to the water and boil for 3 minutes until the broccoli is just tender, but not mushy at all.\nDrain broccoli once it is tender and set aside for assembly. We will warm everything up once the potatoes are assembled at the end.\n5 Open the potatoes: Once your potatoes are baked, let them cool slightly so you can handle them. Cut each potato down the center, being careful not to cut all the way through. Then cut two perpendicular cuts near the end of each potato; this will allow you to open each potato up easier. I like to use a small paring knife to slice up the interior of the potato, making it easier to unfold and stuff.\n5 Stuff the potatoes: Sprinkle some cheese over the potato. I like a lot of cheese, but feel free to use as much or as little as you\xe2\x80\x99d like. Top with about 1/2 cup of cooked broccoli and 1 piece of crumbled bacon. Sprinkle the broccoli with more cheese and more broccoli or bacon depending on the size of the potato and the size of your appetite!\n6 Reheat the potatoes: Place the stuffed potato back in the oven for 5-10 minutes to really melt the cheese and warm the fillings.\n7 Serve: Top the warm potatoes with sour cream and chives and serve.\nLeftovers: Store any extra potatoes before filling them. Leftover potatoes can be used within a week for baked potatoes, loaded potatoes, or quick Dad Add home fries!\n8 How to Make Dad Add Home Fries: Cut a leftover potato into about 1/4-inch cubes. Into a medium skillet set over medium heat, add the olive oil. When the oil starts to shimmer, add the potato cubes and seasoned salt. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are crispy and browned on the edges. Remove from skillet and serve with eggs.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Trim off and discard the woody lower part of the stem (likely an inch or half an inch). Cut the remaining stem off from the head.\nWith a vegetable peeler, peel the outer layers of the stem off and discard them. Cut the tender centers into coins across the grain, then chop those up into little bits. Shred up the blossom ends of the broccoli. You\xe2\x80\x99re aiming for pieces between the size of a pea and an almond.\n2 Cook the broccoli: Set a large skillet over medium-high heat for a minute or less. Add the olive oil; when it shimmers, add the broccoli. Stir it around every minute or so. Season generously with salt.\nAfter 5 minutes of cooking, reduce the heat incrementally so the broccoli does not burn. You\xe2\x80\x99ll end at medium heat. Some bits will get charred and brown, while others steam and become soft and sweet. This is exactly what you want.\nAfter about 10 total minutes of cooking, your broccoli will be ready. The volume will have reduced by about half, and there will not be any raw pieces of broccoli left.\n3 Season and serve: Taste the broccoli, and, if needed, adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper.

Then cut all the stems into 4-inch pieces.\n2 Blanch the broccoli rabe: Bring a saucepan of water to a boil and add 1/4 teaspoon of the salt. Add the broccoli rabe and cook for 1 minute, turning them in the water occasionally so they cook evenly.\nDrain and rinse with very cold water until the broccoli is no longer warm. Pat dry with paper towels.\n2 Cook the lemon slices: In a large heavy skillet over medium-high heat, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Add the lemon slices, overlapping if necessary, and cook without disturbing for 2 minutes. Turn and cook the other sides for 2 minutes more. The slices should be browned in spots.

b"Print\nBroccoli Rabe with Caramelized Onions Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: Serves 4-6\nINGREDIENTS\n3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 yellow onion, sliced into slivers, lengthwise (with the grain)\n1 large bunch of broccoli rabe (raab, rapini), rinsed and cut into 2-inch long pieces\n2-3 garlic cloves, sliced\n1/4 teaspoon red chili flakes\nSalt\nFreshly ground black pepper\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the onions: Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. Add the onions, spread out in a thin layer. Cook, stirring occasionally until softened and then lightly browned.\n(Tip: to speed up the caramelization process you can sprinkle a pinch of sugar over the onions.) If the onions start to dry out at all, lower the heat (you can add a little water to them too.) They should brown, but not get dried out.\n2 Blanch the broccoli rabe: After you start the onions, bring a large pot of water to a boil. The onions take at least 15 minute to cook, so you'll have time to get the water boiling. Salt the water (about a tablespoon of salt for 3 quarts of water).\nPrepare an ice bath, fill a large bowl half way with ice water.\nAdd the rabe to the boiling water. Blanch for 1 minute. Use a slotted spoon to remove from the boiling water and put in the ice bath to stop the cooking. Shocking the rabe with ice water will also help keep the rabe bright green colored.\nNote that some people blanch their rabe, some do not. Rabe can be rather bitter, so blanching will help take the edge off of the bitterness. If your rabe isn't particularly bitter, or you like bitter greens, you can easily skip this blanching step.\nDrain the ice water from the rabe. Use a clean tea towel to gently wring out the excess moisture from the rabe.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 the rabe and onions with chili flakes and garlic: Once the onions are lightly browned, remove them from the pan to a bowl. Using the same pan, add another tablespoon of olive oil and heat the pan on high heat. Add the chili flakes. Once the chili flakes start to sizzle, add the garlic.\nOnce the garlic just starts to brown at the edges add the broccoli rabe and the onions.\nToss the rabe mixture so that it gets well coated with the olive oil. Cook on high heat until most of the moisture is gone, about 5 minutes if you blanched first, a minute or too longer if you skipped the blanching.\nHello!

Blanch only for one minute, then use a slotted spoon to remove the rabe from the hot water to a large bowl of ice water to stop the cooking.\nDrain the rabe and pat dry with paper towels.\n2 Cook the pasta: Typically penne pasta takes about 10 minutes to cook to al dente. So start the pasta before you start saut\xc3\xa9ing the rabe.\nWhen the water comes to a rolling boil, add a tablespoon of salt to it, let the salt dissolve, then add the pasta.\nOnce the water returns to a boil, start the timer. Let the pasta cook, at a rolling boil, uncovered, for whatever time is necessary to cook it to al dente, cooked through but still a little firm.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 the blanched broccoli rabe with garlic and chili flakes: Once the pasta is in the water, heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium to medium high heat.\nAdd the chopped garlic and the red chile flakes.

Never browned butter before? See our detailed how-to here: How to Brown Butter.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup (2 sticks, 8 ounces, 225 g) unsalted butter\n1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon nutmeg\n1 cup brown sugar, packed\n1/2 cup white granulated sugar\n2 large eggs, lightly beaten\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n2 tablespoons water\n1 1/2 cups semi-sweet or bittersweet chocolate chips\n1 cup chopped pecans (optional)\n1 cup sweetened, shredded coconut (optional)\n3 cups rolled oats (old fashioned or quick oats, do not use steel cut or instant)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the oven and the baking sheets. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Butter two large cookie sheets, or line them with silicone mats or parchment paper.\n2 Brown the butter: Place sticks of butter in a thick-bottomed medium sized stainless steel saucepan or other pan with a light, reflective interior. Otherwise you won\'t be able to see the butter browning.\nHeat on medium. Melt the butter, whisking so that the butter melts evenly.\nContinue to cook the butter. As it cooks, the butter will foam up, and then the foam will subside. Whisk frequently to check underneath the bubbly surface.\nAt some point, browned bits will form at the bottom of the pan and the butter will begin to smell nutty. Watch carefully\xe2\x80\x94it\'s easy for the butter to go from browned to burnt.\nWhen the browned bits begin to form, remove the pan from the heat. Pour the melted butter, with the browned bits, into a glass or metal bowl. Allow to cool a bit while you prepare the other ingredients.\n3 Mix the dry ingredients: Vigorously whisk together the flour, salt, baking soda, nutmeg, and cinnamon together in a large bowl.\n4 Make the dough: Place the browned butter (along with the browned bits) in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add the brown and white sugar. Beat on medium-high until smooth, about 3 minutes.\nAdd the eggs and vanilla. Beat for 3 more minutes on medium speed until smooth and light.\n5 Stir in flour mixture and some water: Using a wooden spoon, stir the flour mixture into the batter.\nStir in 2 tablespoons of water (note that if you are using jumbo eggs, and not large eggs as the recipe calls for, you will probably not need this much extra liquid.)\n6 Stir in chocolate chips and oats: Stir in the chocolate chips, and the pecans and shredded coconut (if using). Stir in the rolled oats.\nUp to this point you can make the dough up to a day and a half ahead and store in the refrigerator.\n7 Spoon cookie dough onto lined cookie sheets: Spoon out heaping tablespoons of cookie dough and lay them on lined cookie sheets. Make sure you have about 2" of space between each cookie, as they will flatten a little and spread on the cookie sheet as they bake.\n8 Bake: Bake at 350\xc2\xb0F for 10 minutes, or until they are just brown around the edges, but still soft in the center. They will firm up as they cool. (If you want them crispier, you can bake them from 12 to 14 minutes, but 10 minutes will yield a more chewy cookie.)\n9 Cool: Take the cookies out of the oven and let them cool for two or three minutes on the hot baking sheet. Then, using a metal spatula, carefully transfer the still-hot cookies to a wire rack to cool.\nThey will continue to be soft until completely cooled. Once completely cooled, store in an airtight container for 3 to 5 days.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Add the butter (if you slice it, it will melt more evenly) whisking frequently. Continue to cook the butter.\n2 Watch for brown specs and nutty aroma: Once melted the butter will foam up a bit, then subside. Watch carefully as lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan. Smell the butter; it should have a nutty aroma.\n3 Remove from heat and pour into a bowl to stop the butter from cooking further and perhaps burning.\nIt's pretty easy to overcook browned butter and go from brown to burnt. If the butter starts to blacken, I suggest dumping it and starting over (something I've had to do on occasion), unless you want beurre noir which has a different taste than nutty brown butter.\nIf you want to make sage brown butter sauce, add some fresh sage leaves to the butter once it has melted. Allow the butter to brown and remove from heat.\nUse browned butter immediately or store covered in the refrigerator for future use.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

The butter should have a wonderful nutty aroma.\nRemove from heat. Add the thyme, whisking continuously. If using fresh thyme, the mixture will foam up a bit.\n(Note that it doesn't take much time to go from browned butter to burnt butter. You will want to remove the pan from the heat element and place it on a cool surface to help stop the cooking of the butter. If the butter burns, I recommend dumping it and starting over, something I've had to do on occasion when not paying close attention.)\n2 Brown the cubed squash in the butter: Add the cubed butternut squash pieces to the pan and return the pan to the burner, heating to medium high.\nUse a wooden or metal spoon to stir the squash pieces so they are all well coated with the butter thyme mixture.\nSprinkle generously with salt and pepper.\nSpread the squash pieces out in an even layer and let cook, without stirring, so that they brown a bit on one side (several minutes). Stir and spread the pieces out again and let cook without stirring so more sides get browned.\n3 Lower the heat, cover and cook: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let cook until the squash is tender, 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how big you cut the pieces.\nAdd more salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle with a bit more chopped fresh thyme before serving.\nHello!

Whisk frequently over several minutes.\nWhen you start to smell the nutty aroma of the butter browning, and you can whisk aside some of the foam to see small browned bits at the bottom of the pan, remove from heat and pour off into a bowl. Do not dawdle at this point as it is easy for the butter to go from browned to burnt.\n3 Whisk together dry ingredients: Place the flour, salt, baking soda, and cinnamon in a bowl and vigorously whisk together.\n4 Beat brown butter and sugars, then add eggs and vanilla: Pour browned butter into the bowl of a stand-up mixer (if you don't have a mixer, you can just beat by hand).

b'Print\nSeared Scallops with Brown Butter Caper Sauce Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 3 to 4\nWhen shopping for scallops, choose only scallops that have a fresh, sweet smell. If they smell fishy, they\'re not fresh and they won\'t taste good.\nIf you have a choice, look for "dry pack" instead of "wet pack" scallops. The dry pack scallops will sear well. The wet pack ones are almost impossible to sear.\nThe trick to cooking scallops is to sear them on very high heat. If the heat isn\'t high enough, the scallops will take too long to brown, and get overcooked and rubbery.\nINGREDIENTS\n6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil or canola oil\n1 pound sea scallops (about a dozen)*\n3/4 cup dry white wine\n2 tablespoons capers, drained\n2 teaspoons lemon zest\n*Sea scallops are the large scallops (about 1 1/2 inches wide), different from their much smaller cousins, bay scallops.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the butter: Cut up the butter into pieces (a tablespoon each or so) and place in a stainless steel saucepan. Melt the butter on medium heat. Allow the butter to foam up and recede. Watch carefully. After a few minutes, the milk solids will form and sink to the bottom.\nOnce the milk solids begin to turn caramel-colored brown, the butter will have a lovely nutty aroma.\nRemove from heat and pour the browned butter into a separate bowl to stop the cooking. (Pay attention! If you wait too long, you\'ll have blackened butter, not browned butter.) Set aside.\n2 Remove "foot" and pat dry scallops: Remove the "foot" of the scallop from each scallop. (The foot is a small tough piece of meat that attaches the scallop to the shell.) Pat dry the scallops.\n3 Sear the scallops on both sides on high heat: Heat the oil in a cast iron pan or hard-anodized aluminum saut\xc3\xa9 pan on high heat.\nWhen the oil is shimmery hot, pat dry the scallops again and carefully place them in the pan, flat side down.\nYou may need to work in batches so you don\'t crowd the pan.\nOnce you\'ve placed the scallops in the pan, do not move them. Allow them to sear.\nOnce you can see that the edges of the scallops touching the pan have browned, use tongs to turn the scallops over and sear the other side. Depending on the size of the scallops and the heat of your burner, this should take 3 to 4 minutes per side.\nOnce both sides are browned, remove the scallops to a warm plate, and turn off the burner.\n4 Deglaze pan with white wine: Pour out the remaining oil from the pan, leaving any browned bits in the pan. Add the white wine to the pan and return the pan to the burner on high heat.\nLet the wine boil and reduce until you have 2 tablespoons of liquid left in the pan.\n5 Add capers, lemon zest, brown butter: Then turn off the heat, add the capers, lemon zest, and brown butter to the pan. Swirl to combine.\n6 Serve scallops with sauce: Place scallops on serving plates and pour sauce over them. Serve immediately.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nBroiled Lobster Tail with Brown Butter Sauce Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 2\nIf starting with frozen lobster tails, prepare a bowl with 2 quarts of cold water and 1 Tbsp salt. Stir to dissolve the salt. Place the lobster tails in the water. Add a few ice cubes. Let sit for half hour to an hour until defrosted.\nThis recipe calls for lobster tails that are 6 to 8 ounces each. If you are cooking smaller or larger lobster tails, you'll need to adjust the broiling time down or up. For example, a 3 ounce lobster tail should take 3 to 4 minutes to broil.\nThe trickiest part of working with lobster tails is opening the shell and loosening the meat enough to pull it through the cut you've made in the shell. Depending on at what point of the lobster's molting cycle the lobster was caught, the shell can be either really thick and strong, or thin and easy to manipulate.\nTake care if working with an especially hard shell so you don't cut yourself, and use a strong hand. (I recommend watching this video for a good explanation of the technique.)\nINGREDIENTS\n1/4 cup unsalted raw hazelnuts\n8 tablespoons unsalted butter\n2 tablespoons minced shallots\n1 teaspoon chopped fresh parsley\n1/4 teaspoon grated lemon zest\nPinch of salt\n2 lobster tails (6 to 8 ounces each), fresh or frozen\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nIf starting with frozen lobster tails, while the lobster tails are defrosting, prepare the hazelnut brown butter sauce to save time.\n1 Toast the hazelnuts: Toast hazelnuts in a small skillet on medium to medium high heat. When fragrant and lightly browned, remove hazelnuts from pan and place in the center a dry, clean dish towel.\nRub the hazelnuts together inside of the dish towel to remove as much of the papery dark skins as you can. Coarsely chop them and set aside.\n2 Brown the butter: In a small stainless steel saucepan, melt the butter on medium heat. (Use stainless so you will easily be able to tell when the butter is browning.)\nAfter the butter melts, it will foam up, and recede. The milk solids will fall to the bottom of the pan.\nContinue to heat and the milk solids will start to brown giving the melted butter a wonderful nutty aroma.\nLet most of the milk solids brown and then remove from heat and strain through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl, to remove the browned milk solids.\nRemove 2 tablespoons of the melted brown butter and set aside (they will be brushed on to the lobster tails before broiling. (See more details in How to Brown Butter.)\n3 Complete the sauce: To the remaining brown butter, add the chopped hazelnuts, parsley, shallots, lemon zest and salt. Set aside.\n4 Prepare lobster tails for broiling: Place rack in medium position in oven. Preheat broiler. Place a layer of foil over a broiling pan or roasting pan.\nUsing kitchen shears or strong scissors, cut the top side of the lobster tail shells lengthwise, from open end to the base of the tail.\nTo help make the shell easier to deal with, put the tail upside-down in the palm of your hand and squeeze to break the translucent bottom shell (see this useful video I found on YouTube).\nGrip the sides of the shell and pull open by about an inch or two.\nUsing your finger, carefully wiggle between the lobster meat and the shell and separate the meat from the shell.\nThen gently pull the meat up through the crack you've created, keeping the meat attached to the tail, and let the lobster meat sit on top of the shell. Place the tails on the foil-lined broiling pan.\n5 Brush lobster tails with browned butter and broil: Pull back the lobster meat to expose as much of it as possible. Brush the exposed lobster meat with the unadorned browned butter you set aside in step 2.\nBroil for 7 to 10 minutes until the meat is cooked through (less time for smaller lobster tails), and the shells are bright red.\nI recommend using a meat thermometer, which should read 145\xc2\xb0F when the lobster is done.\n6 Serve with browned butter hazelnut sauce: When the lobster tails are done, remove from oven and place on serving plates. Spoon the browned butter hazelnut sauce over the lobster meat of the lobster tails to serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Lower the heat to a simmer.\nCover and let the cauliflower cook for 10-14 minutes, until very tender.\n2 Brown the butter: While the cauliflower is cooking, melt the butter in a small saucepan (easier to use a stainless steel pan so that you can see the browning occur) on medium heat.\nOnce the butter melts, it will begin to foam up a bit. When the foam subsides, look for amber colored bits forming at the bottom of the pan.\nWhen the butter begins to brown, smell it. It will have a lovely nutty aroma.\nWhen you can see lots of flecks of browned bits, and the melted butter smells wonderful, remove it from the heat and pour into a bowl (glass or metal).\nButter can quickly go from browned to burnt, so keep an eye on it and work quickly when the butter starts to brown! (See our more detailed instructions on How to Brown Butter.)\n3 Strain the cooked cauliflower: When the cauliflower is cooked through and tender enough to mash with a fork, strain out all but a tablespoon or two of the remaining water.\n4 Mash with a potato masher and stir in the brown butter and sour cream. (Make sure to scrape in all the browned bits from the butter; that's where the flavor is!)\n5 Pur\xc3\xa9e to desired consistency: Use an immersion blender or a standing blender and blend the mashed potatoes to as smooth a consistency as you would like. Or just mash more with a potato masher if you like a chunky consistency.\nAdd salt and pepper to taste. Top with chopped chives, green onions, or parsley to serve.\n  Hello!

When it\xe2\x80\x99s ready, the squash will be soft and some of the edges will have browned.\n2 Cook the pasta: Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook the pasta to al dente, or according to package directions. Drain well and set aside.\n3 Fry the bacon: In a large, deep skillet (I used cast iron), put the bacon in a cold pan and cook over medium heat until crispy. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.\n4 Cook the shallots: Place the skillet back on the stove, but with the heat turned off. Drain all but about 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease.\nAdd the shallots and cook in the residual heat from the skillet; this helps prevent the shallots from burning. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be cooking fast enough, turn the heat to medium-low and cook for just a couple of minutes until they start to soften and become aromatic. Transfer the cooked shallots to a large bowl.\n  5 Combine the bacon, shallots, squash and pasta: After the bacon cools, cut it into small pieces using kitchen scissors (or using a chef's knife), and combine with the shallots in a large bowl\xe2\x80\x94or you can use the stockpot you cooked the pasta in (I like to do this if it's just me and the boys).\nAdd the pasta and toss to combine. When the squash comes out of the oven, add the squash to this bowl and toss gently together.\n  6 Brown the butter: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir it constantly and keep an eye on it so it does not burn. (See here for full instructions on how to brown butter.) It will start to crackle, foam, and smell nutty. The color will deepen to a caramel/amber hue.\nAround when the butter stops foaming\xe2\x80\x94or at least it starts to subside\xe2\x80\x94and the butter turns slightly brown, add the sage leaves.\nRemove the saucepan from the heat as soon as the sage leaves start to curl. Pour the butter and the sage leaves into the bowl with the rest of the ingredients.\n  7 Combine all ingredients and serve: Toss everything gently together with a wooden spoon. Taste and add salt and/or pepper if needed. Serve immediately with freshly grated cheese over the top.\nIf you are feeling extra decadent, add a chunk of unsalted butter or a splash of extra virgin olive oil on top when you toss, or some of the reserved bacon grease.\nLeftovers keep for about 2 to 3 days and reheat fairly well. I like to add a bit of olive oil or water to the pot when I reheat it over low heat. (I try to avoid microwaving leftover pasta because it just makes it gummy.)\nHello!

b"Print\nSquid Ink Pasta with Pumpkin, Sage and Brown Butter Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 10 minutesYield: Serves 4\nSquid ink pasta typically comes as either spaghetti or linguine; either will work fine.\nWe dust the insides of the pumpkin with a little sugar, just to accentuate the sweetness of the pumpkin. You can use either brown or white sugar, or skip it all together.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 small sugar pumpkins, each about 1 pound to 1 1/2 pound\nSalt\n2 to 4 teaspoons of white sugar, or 2 to 4 Tbsp of brown sugar (to taste)\n1 pound squid ink pasta\n6 tablespoons butter\n1/4 cup thinly sliced fresh sage leaves (with a few small whole leaves for garnish)\nA splash of apple cider vinegar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare and bake the pumpkin shells: Heat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Slice off the top quarter of each pumpkin and scoop out the insides. (Save the seeds to make toasted pumpkin seeds.)\nUsing a strong metal spoon or a small sharp knife, scrape all the fibrous insides out of the pumpkins. Sprinkle the insides of the pumpkins with salt and sugar.\nSet the pumpkins on a baking sheet and bake at 350\xc2\xb0F for 1 hour, or until a fork easily pierces the flesh and the edges are lightly browned.\n2 Start cooking the pasta: Prepare the pasta water while the pumpkins are cooking. Bring a large pot of well salted water (it should taste like the sea) to a boil. When the pumpkins have about 10 minutes to go before they're done, add the pasta to the boiling water.\nWhen the pumpkins are cooked remove them from the oven to a serving dish or plates.\n3 Make the brown butter sauce with sage: While the pasta is cooking, prepare the brown butter sauce. Heat the butter in a saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium heat. Add the sage leaves and cook until browned bits begin to form in the butter and there is a lovely nutty aroma.\nRemove any whole sage leaves you are using for garnish.\nRemove the pan from the heat and pour the brown butter into a large serving bowl (this will stop the butter from cooking further). Browned butter can easily turn to blackened butter, which is not the flavor you want for this recipe.\n4 Stir in the pasta into the brown butter sauce, add vinegar, salt: When the pasta is ready (al dente, slightly firm, but cooked through), use tongs to remove the pasta from the pot to the large bowl with the brown butter.\nAllow some of the water from the pasta to drip into the bowl, it will help with the sauce. Toss the pasta with the brown butter.\nSplash a little cider vinegar over it. Taste for salt, it will likely need a bit more, especially if you've used unsalted butter. Add more if needed.\n5 Serve: Serve the pasta in the baked pumpkin shells. Garnish with reserved whole sage leaves that you had cooked with the sliced sage in the butter.\nHello!

(Use a stainless steel saucepan so you can see the butter browning.) Let the butter melt and continue to watch it as it cooks. The butter will foam for a bit and then calm down.\nAfter a few minutes, flecks of brown will appear at the bottom of the pan. When you see this, and the melted butter takes on a nutty aroma, take it off the heat. (See How to Brown Butter.)\n3 Add sage and pour over potatoes: Add the chopped sage to the butter (it may cause some foaming). Pour over the potatoes.\n4 Add the goat cheese and milk and mash the potatoes with a potato masher until smooth and all ingredients are well incorporated. Salt and pepper to taste and serve immediately.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'
b"Print\nBrownie in a Mug Recipe\nPrep time: 3 minutesCook time: 2 minutesYield: Makes one serving\nSome mugs don't microwave well because there is metal in their ceramic glaze. They'll work but they may get very hot. Best to use a plain old everyday un-fancy mug. A regular 12 to 16 ounce mug will do fine.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/4 cup flour (30 g)\n1/4 cup sugar (50 g)\n2 tablespoons (13 g) cocoa (natural, unsweetened)\nPinch of salt\nTiny pinch of cinnamon\n1/4 cup water (60 ml)\n2 tablespoons (30 ml) melted butter, or neutral oil\n1/8 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 small scoop of ice cream or 1 or 2 teaspoons heavy whipping cream to serve\nMETHOD\n1 Add the dry ingredients to the mug and stir: Place flour, sugar, cocoa, salt, and cinnamon in a microwave safe ceramic mug. Stir with a fork or spoon to mix well and break up any clumps.\n2 Add the wet ingredients and stir: Add the butter or oil, water, and vanilla to the cup and stir until the mixture is smooth and there are no lumps.\n3 Zap in microwave: Place in microwave and heat on high until the mixture is cooked through, about a 1 minute and 40 seconds for a 1000 watt microwave, or 1 minute 10 seconds on a 1650 watt microwave.\nYou may have to experiment and adjust the time for less or more powerful microwaves. If you don't know the power level on your microwave, start with 60 seconds and increase until the brownie is done. It should still be moist when cooked through, not dry.\n4 Top with ice cream! Let cool for a minute and serve with a scoop of vanilla ice cream or a teaspoon or two of whipping cream poured over.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nFudgy Gluten-Free Chocolate Brownies Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesCooling Time: 2 hours time: Yield: 16 small, 2-inch square brownies\nIf you\'ve never baked gluten-free before, we highly recommend using Bob\'s Red Mill 1:1 Gluten Free Baking Flour Blend for this recipe.\nIf you\'re using a different blend, double check the ingredients. If it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t contain xanthan gum (or another binding ingredient like guar gum or psyllium husks), we recommend adding 1/2 teaspoon of xanthan gum to ensure success.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 tablespoons ground flax\n1 cup (148 grams) gluten-free flour blend, like Bob\'s Red Mill\n1/2 cup (40 grams) dairy-free cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 cup coconut oil at room temperature, plus more for the pan\n5 ounces (140g) bittersweet dairy-free chocolate, chopped\n1 1/2 cups (300 grams) sugar\n1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract\nMETHOD\n1 Heat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F and prepare the pan: Line an 8\xc3\x978 square baking pan with parchment paper, and grease the parchment paper and pan with a little coconut oil.\n2 Prepare the flax "egg": Combine the flax with 8 tablespoons of water in a small bowl. Let stand for 7 to 10 minutes to thicken. (This will be used as an egg replacer in this recipe.)\n3 Whisk dry ingredients: In a small mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt.\n4 Melt the coconut oil and chocolate: In a small saucepan over low heat, warm the coconut oil and chopped chocolate, stirring until the chocolate is completely melted, about 2 minutes.\n5 Add the sugar and vanilla: Whisk the sugar and vanilla into the chocolate mixture, stirring vigorously until combined. The mixture will be a little grainy at this point, which is perfectly okay.\n6 Make the batter: Pour the chocolate mixture into a large mixing bowl, scraping everything from the pan. Fold in the flax eggs.\nAdd the dry ingredients and stir well with a wooden spoon or rubber spatula until well combined. The batter will be quite thick and will gather into a ball\xe2\x80\x94it won\xe2\x80\x99t be loose and thin like many traditional brownie batters.\n7 Scoop the batter into the prepared pan, and use a rubber spatula or the palm of your hand to press it into the pan in an even layer.\n8 Bake the brownies for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the edges are set and no longer jiggly. The tops of the brownies will still feel very soft and may even be bubbling a little; they\xe2\x80\x99ll firm up as they cool.\n9 Cool: Let the brownies cool completely before slicing, at least 2 to 3 hours. Because these are so fudgy, they really will slice best if you allow them to fully cool.\n10 Slice, serve, and store: Using the parchment paper as a handle, lift the cooled brownies up out of the pan and onto a cutting board. Slice into a 4x4 grid (making 16 small squares). Leftover brownies can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for up to 5 days.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nPeanut Butter Swirl Brownies Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 34 minutesYield: 16 brownies\nINGREDIENTS\n6 ounces semisweet chocolate chips\n8 tablespoons (1 stick, 4 ounces) unsalted butter\n2 large eggs\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 cup dark brown sugar\n1 tablespoon instant espresso coffee powder\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n2/3 cup all-purpose flour\n2/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 cup smooth peanut butter\n2 tablespoons powdered sugar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 350\xcb\x9aF. Line an 8-inch square baking dish with parchment paper; set aside.\n2 Melt the chocolate and butter: Set the chocolate and butter in a heat-proof bowl over a pot of simmering water\xe2\x80\x94the bottom of the bowl should not touch the water. Stir until the chocolate has melted. Remove from heat.\n  3 Make the batter: Whisk together the eggs, both sugars, coffee powder, and vanilla extract. Add in the flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder, and melted butter-chocolate mixture and stir until evenly combined. (The batter will be very thick, but don't worry! That's how it's supposed to be.)\nPress the brownie batter into the prepared baking dish in an even layer.\n   4 Add the peanut butter swirl. Warm the peanut butter in the microwave until it's loosened enough to drizzle, about 30 seconds on high. Stir the powdered sugar into the peanut butter, then drizzle over the top of the brownie batter.\nUse a butter knife to swirl the peanut butter mixture into the top of the brownie batter. Be careful not to over mix the peanut butter into the brownie mixture.\n5 Bake the brownies: Bake the brownies until a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out mostly clean, about 35 minutes. (The peanut butter will probably stick to the toothpick a little bit; that's fine.) Transfer to a wire rack to cool.\n6 Cool and slice: Let the brownies cool completely to room temperature before cutting them. For cleaner slicing with fewer crumbs, pop the pan in the freezer for a few minutes once it's cooled to room temperature to help with slicing to help keep them from sticking to the knife.\nHello!

In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter and brown sugar together until just combined.\nOn medium speed, beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl after each addition, followed by the vanilla extract. The dough will be soft, but that\xe2\x80\x99s what we want. On low speed, beat in the flour mixture all at once, until just combined. Mix in the chocolate chips by hand, or with the mixer on low speed.\nTransfer the dough to a piece of plastic wrap and form into a flat rectangle (this will help the dough chill faster). Wrap the plastic wrap around the dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\n3 Make the brownie dough. In a large, microwave-safe mixing bowl melt the chocolate and butter together in 30-second intervals, stirring between each, until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is smooth. Whisk in the brown sugar, followed by the eggs and vanilla extract.\nUsing a spatula, fold in the flour, sifted cocoa powder, baking powder, salt, and chocolate chips to form a very soft dough.\nTransfer the dough to a piece of plastic wrap and form into a flat rectangle (this will help the dough chill faster). Wrap the plastic wrap around the dough and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.\n4 Shape the brookies: Once both doughs have chilled, use a small cookie scoop to measure about 1 tablespoon of each dough. Using your palms, roll the two doughs gently together to form a ball and place on the parchment-lined baking sheet.\nPlace all the dough balls on one of the baking sheets (it's ok to crowd them), cover with plastic wrap, and chill for at least 30 minutes while the oven preheats or up to overnight.\n5 Preheat the oven to 375\xc2\xb0F for 30 minutes with an oven rack in the center position.\n6 Bake the brookies:  Rearrange the chilled cookie dough balls between two sheet pans so they are spaced a few inches apart. (If you have more than will fit comfortably, transfer the extras to a dinner plate and place back in the fridge). Sprinkle lightly with sea salt.\nBake one sheet at a time for 10 to 12 minutes. Let the cookies cool on the sheet pan for 3 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with the remaining dough.\nStore the cookies in an airtight container on the counter. They will keep for about 3 to 4 days before starting to dry out.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Save It Print\nFudgy Chocolate Brownies Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: 16 regular brownies or 25 brownie bites\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4 cup (105 grams) all-purpose flour\n1/8 teaspoon baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n6 tablespoons (3 ounces) unsalted butter, cut up\n2 ounces unsweetened chocolate, broken into 1-inch pieces\n1 cup (200 grams) granulated sugar\n2 large eggs\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 cup (6 ounces) mini bittersweet-chocolate chips, optional\nSpecial equipment:\n8x8 baking pan\nMedium saucepan, 2-quarts or larger\nHeatproof spatula\nWire cooling rack\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the oven to 350F and prepare the pan: Line an 8x8 baking pan with a sling of parchment, long enough so that the parchment hangs over the sides of the pan. Coat the exposed sides of the pan with cooking spray (also, a little cooking spray under the parchment will help it stick in place, if needed).\n2 Combine the dry ingredients: In a bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Set aside.\n3 Melt the chocolate and butter: In a medium saucepan over medium-low heat, melt the butter. It should not brown at the edges.\nAdd the chocolate and let it melt, stirring occasionally with a heatproof spatula, until the mixture is smooth.\n4 Set the pan on a cooling rack to cool until you can touch the bottom of with your hand comfortably.\n5 Make the batter: Using a rubber spatula, stir the sugar into the chocolate mixture until it combined. The mixture may look crumbly or smooth after mixing; either is fine.\nAdd the eggs, one at a time, followed by the vanilla. Add the flour mixture, and stir until no more white patches show. Stir in the chips until well distributed.\n6 Pour the batter into the pan. Use a spatula to spread it to the edges of the pan and smooth the top. Tap the pan once or twice hard on the counter to settle any air pockets; you can also poke the air pockets with the tip of a paring knife.\n7 Bake the brownies: Transfer the pan to the oven and bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the top is slightly puffed and just set. If in doubt, it's better to under-bake these brownies a touch rather than over-bake. (The toothpick test doesn't work well for these brownies because the chocolate chips get melty!)\n8 Cool the brownies completely: Set the pan on a wire rack until completely cooled.\n9 Once cool, cover the pan and refrigerate for several hours or until firm and cold. This makes the brownies easier to slice cleanly.\nIf you're eager for brownies and can't wait for them to chill, skip this chilling step and serve them warm or just-cooled! They will be a little crumbly when you cut them.)\n6 Cut the squares: Run a thin knife around the edge of the pan to make sure the block of brownies is loose, then lift from the pan using the parchment paper sling. On a cutting board, slice the brownies into a 4x4 grid (to make 16 squares) or into a 5x5 grid (to make 25 mini-brownies).\nBrownies can be served right away. Leftovers can be stored in an airtight container at room temperature for at least a week. (They will keep for longer, but may start getting dry and crumbly after a while.)\nHello!

Fold in the flour mixture.\n5 Spread the batter in the pan: Using an offset spatula or standard spatula, spread the batter into a thin, even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes. When finished, the brownie should have puffed up just a little, and the top should look dry.\n6 Cool and cut the cookies: Let cool completely. Once cool, use the parchment sides to lift the cookie out of the pan. Transfer to a large cutting board.\nUse a ruler to trim about 1/4 of an inch off each side so you have smooth even edges. Measure the trimmed cookie. Then use the ruler to measure\xe2\x80\x94and a long knife to cut\xe2\x80\x946 long strips the same width. Each strip should be about 2 to 2 1/2 inches wide. Measure the long strips to find the halfway point, and cut them across the center. Once cut, you should have 12 thin, rectangular brownies.\nUse an offset spatula or knife and run it between one of the rectangular brownies and the parchment. Put one brownie on top of the next just to make sure the tops are the same size as the bottoms. Trim if necessary. Take the top brownie off, and put it back where it was. Lift up the parchment and slide the cookies to the side.\n7 Assemble the ice cream sandwiches: Get a piece of plastic wrap ready. Take the half-gallon of ice cream out of the freezer. Remove the cardboard container either by unfolding it or removing the lid. Cut it down the middle like a T, and then around the bottom, and set the block of ice cream on a cutting board.\nSlice it longways into 1-inch thick slabs. Do this one slab at a time. Place your slab on a cutting board. Your slabs will be larger than the brownie. Place one brownie on top of the ice cream slab. Cut the ice cream to size.\nLift the ice cream and brownie up; place it brownie down on the plastic wrap; put the other brownie on top of the ice cream. Then, wrap the ice cream sandwich in plastic wrap. Repeat this until all the sandwiches are made and wrapped. Freeze until you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to enjoy.\nYou probably won\xe2\x80\x99t use all the ice cream. Scoop what remains into a Tupperware container and freeze for another day.\nHello!

b'Print\nSausage Breakfast Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 6 to 8\nBread that is a little bit dry will hold up better in the casserole and provide more structure, which is why breakfast casseroles tend to call for "day old" bread. If your bread is fresh or soft, after you cube it, spread it out on a sheet pan and put it in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 to 12 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Italian pork sausage\n10 large eggs, beaten\n4 cups whole milk\n1 teaspoon dry mustard\n1/4 teaspoon onion powder\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\nFresh ground pepper to taste\n5 cups cubed day old bread (we recommend rustic French or Italian loaf), cut into 3/4-inch to 1 inch-wide cubes\n2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese\n1/2 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)\n1/2 cup peeled, cored, chopped tomatoes (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the sausage: Heat a skillet on medium. Break up the sausage into chunks and cook, working in batches if need be, until cooked on all sides. As you cook the sausage, you can break up the larger chunks into smaller crumbles (which are easier to distribute evenly over the casserole).\nWhen lightly browned, remove from pan to a paper towel lined plate to absorb any excess fat.\n2 In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, dry mustard, onion powder, salt and pepper.\n3 Assemble the casserole: Place the cubed bread in a well-buttered 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle with cheese. Sprinkle with chopped tomatoes and mushrooms, if using. Top with the browned crumbled sausage, distributing it evenly. Pour the egg milk mixture evenly over the bread and cheese.\n4 Cover and chill, if making ahead: At this point, the casserole can be covered and chilled in the fridge until ready to bake and serve, up to overnight.\nIf baking immediately, let the casserole sit for 10 minutes before putting in the oven (to give the bread a chance to absorb the milk-egg mixture.\n5 Bake the casserole: When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xb0F. Bake uncovered for about one hour. Tent with foil if the top begins to brown too quickly.\n6 Serve: Let the casserole cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for about a week.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'
b"Print\nEasy Breakfast Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 50 minutesYield: Serves 8\nThe ingredient proportions are estimates. The more eggs, the firmer and less likely to deflate the casserole will be.\nMushrooms tend to hold a lot of moisture, so if you use a lot of them, you may want to saut\xc3\xa9 them first to release some of their water.\nDon't have day-old bread? Put slices of fresh bread into a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the breakfast casserole base:\n6 to 10 large eggs\n2 to 3 cups grated cheddar cheese\n6 slices day-old bread, cut into 3/4-inch to 1-inch-wide cubes\n2 cups milk\nSalt\nPepper\nFor the possible additions: \n1 cup corn (cooked or frozen)\n1/2 cup chopped broccoli (cooked or raw, raw will turn out crunchier)\n1/2 cup sliced mushrooms\n1/4 cup sliced green onions\n1 cup cubed ham and/or cooked Italian sausage\nA few slices cooked bacon, chopped\n1 teaspoon Herbes de Provence, or other dried herbs, (or 1 tablespoon of fresh chopped herbs such as basil, rosemary, or thyme)\n1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon of cumin or curry powder\nSpecial equipment:\n9x13 inch casserole dish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Beat eggs, add milk and cheese: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Beat the eggs in a large bowl. Mix in the milk and cheese.\n2 Add the bread and carefully stir until all pieces of bread are moistened (don't over mix or the bread may disintegrate).\n3 Add the additions: Add salt and pepper to taste (if using Italian sausage, you won't need either.) If you have a lot of additions, you might need a couple more eggs to make sure that everything is at least touching some egg mixture. Just whisk in 2 tablespoons of milk for every beaten egg you add.\n4 Bake: Butter a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Pour the mixture into the casserole dish.\nBake in a 350\xc2\xb0F oven for 50 minutes to an hour, until the top is browned and the center springs back when touched.\nRemove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes before serving.\nHello!

If you are using a frozen pie crust, don't defrost it, just proceed to step 2.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 recipe pie dough enough for one bottom crust (see P\xc3\xa2te Bris\xc3\xa9e recipe)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1/3 cup thinly sliced shallots\n1 pound assorted mushrooms, quartered or sliced (include some shiitakes if you want great mushroom flavor)\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground pepper\n1/2 cup milk\n1/2 cup heavy cream\n3 large eggs\nPinch nutmeg\n6 ounces Gruy\xc3\xa8re cheese, grated (1 1/2 cups)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Roll-out dough: Roll out dough on a clean, lightly floured surface into a 12-inch circle. Line a 10 by 1 1/2-inch tart pan with the rolled out dough. Trim the edges.\nChill in freezer for 30 minutes. (You need to pre-freeze the raw crust or it will slip down the sides of the pan when it cooks.)\nAt this point, if you are using a pre-frozen pie crust proceed to step 2.\n2 Pre-bake crust: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Line the crust with aluminum foil or parchment paper, pushing into the bottom edge. Don't cut the foil or parchment paper too close to the crust, allow for enough room to easily lift it out.\nFill it at least two-thirds with baking weights\xe2\x80\x94dried beans (I keep a bag of pinto beans just to use for pie weights), rice, or aluminum pie weights.\nBake initially for 15 minutes, then remove from oven and let cool a few minutes. Carefully remove parchment paper and weights.\nPoke the bottom of the pie pan with the tines of a fork and return to oven and bake an additional 10 minutes or until lightly golden. (Fork holes are for any air to escape.) Let cool on a rack while you make the filling.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 shallots and mushrooms: Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium high heat. Saut\xc3\xa9 the shallots for a minute, then add the mushrooms.\nSprinkle with salt and pepper and cook, stirring frequently, until the mushrooms release all of their moisture, and get well browned, about 10 minutes.\n4 Make the egg cream milk filling: Whisk together the cream, milk, and eggs in a medium bowl. Stir in nutmeg, salt and pepper.\n5 Assemble the tart: Place the tart pan on a rimmed baking sheet to catch any run-off or leaks. Sprinkle half of the grated Gruyere over the bottom of the crust. Spread the mushrooms and shallots over the cheese in an even layer, and sprinkle with the remaining cheese.\nPour the egg mixture over the mushrooms and cheese in the crust.\n6 Bake: Put the baking sheet with the tart pan in the oven and bake at 350\xc2\xb0F until the center is just set, still a little wiggly, about 30 to 35 minutes.\nRemove to a rack and let cool for 20 minutes before slicing.\n  Hello!

b'Print\nCaramelized Onion Quiche Recipe\nYield: Serves 6-8\nNote that although this recipe calls for making a pie crust from scratch, you can easily use an already prepared frozen pie crust. Just pre-bake it using the directions that follow.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 recipe pie dough (see P\xc3\xa2te Bris\xc3\xa9e recipe)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2-3 large red onions (about one pound total), French-cut (see below)\nSalt and freshly ground pepper\n2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar\n3/4 cup milk\n1/4 cup heavy cream\n3 large eggs\nPinch nutmeg\n6 ounces Gruy\xc3\xa8re cheese, grated (1 1/2 cups)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nSLICING ONIONS STEM TO ROOT\nTo caramelize onions, you\'ll want to slice them lengthwise, or from stem end to root end. That way the onions will hold their shape better during the long cooking involved in caramelizing. (See How to Slice an Onion for more details.)\n1 First, use a sharp knife, get a firm grip on the onion, and slice off the stem end of the onion, by about a 1/2 inch. Cut about 1/8th of an inch from the root end, cutting off the roots, but leaving the core intact. Then place the onion root side up on the board to stabilize it, and cut it in half, straight through the root end.\n\n2 Peel back the papery skin of the onions. If you want, to keep your cutting area clean, cut off the roots with the skins, but cut only enough to cut off the messy roots. Keep the root end intact. It will make it easier to slice the onion.\n\n3 With an onion half cut-side down on the board to stabilize it, make angled cuts into the onion, from stem end to root end, cutting to, but not through the root end. Work your way around the arc of the onion, aiming your knife\'s blade toward the center of the onion.\n4 Make a "V" cut in the root end of the onion to cut out the tough root end, to release the onion slices.\nPRE-BAKE THE CRUST\n1 Make a frozen tart crust: If you are making your own crust (instead of using an already prepared frozen crust), roll out your dough on a lightly floured surface, into a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 9-by-1 1/2-inch round tart pan (or 9-inch pie dish), pressing dough into corners, extending the edges extra high to allow for shrinkage. Transfer to freezer to chill for 30 minutes.\n2 Line frozen crust with foil and pie weights: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Line pastry with aluminum foil, pressing into the corners and edges, allowing extra foil on the sides (they\'ll be your handles when you remove the foil).\nFill at least two-thirds with baking weights\xe2\x80\x94dried beans, rice, copper pennies, or ceramic or metal pie weights.\n3 Bake with weights: Bake first for 15 minutes, remove from oven and let cool a few minutes. Carefully remove aluminum foil and weights.\n4 Remove weights and bake again: Poke the bottom of the pie pan with the tines of a fork and return to oven and bake an additional 10 minutes or until lightly golden. (Fork holes are for any air to escape.) Transfer to a wire rack to cool while making filling.\n  CARAMELIZING THE ONIONS AND PREPARING THE QUICHE\nThe onions will take about an hour to cook on the stovetop before they are ready to go into the quiche. So timing-wise, if you are making the entire quiche from scratch, it makes sense to get started on the onions once you\'ve put the crust into the freezer to chill before pre-baking.\n1 Caramelize the onions: Heat 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. Add the onions and sprinkle a little salt over them. Cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened and are translucent. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook for an additional 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are well browned. (See How to Caramelize Onions for more details.)\nAdd 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar and cook for 10 minutes more, until onions are completely caramelized. Remove from heat.\n2 Assemble the quiche: Place tart pan on a baking sheet to catch any run-off there might be. Sprinkle half the cheese evenly over the bottom of the crust. Spread onions over the cheese and then top with remaining cheese.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together milk, cream, and eggs. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Pour over the tart.\n3 Bake the quiche: Transfer to the 350\xc2\xb0F oven, and bake until just set in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 10-15 minutes before slicing.\nHello!

b'Print\nSmoked Salmon, Dill, and Goat Cheese Quiche Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 6\nThe filling recipe makes enough filling for a tall quiche in a 9-inch wide by 2-inch tall tart pan. If you are using a commercial frozen crust, you may find you have enough filling for 2 quiche pies.\nINGREDIENTS\nCrust:\n1 1/4 cups all purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n10 tablespoons (1 1/4 stick, 5 ounces) butter\n2 to 2 1/2 tablespoons of water\nOne 9-inch x 2-inch high tart pan with removable bottom (or can use a 10-inch pie pan)\nFilling:\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n4 medium shallots, thinly sliced (about 1/2 cup)\n6 ounces smoked salmon, chopped\n4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled\n6 large eggs\n2 cup milk\n1 cup cream\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh dill\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n2 1/2 teaspoons salt\n1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the dough: Whisk together the flour and salt in a medium bowl. Cut the butter into cubes and add to the flour. Use your clean hands to work the butter into the flour until you have a mixture that a coarse meal with pieces of butter no bigger than the size of a pea.\nAdd the water a tablespoon at a time, working it into the dough with your hands until the dough can be formed into a ball.\nFlatten the ball into a disk. Wrap with plastic wrap and chill for 1 to 2 hours.\n2 Roll out the dough: When ready to roll out, remove the disk from the refrigerator and let sit for 10 minutes to come closer to room temperature.\nRoll out on a lightly floured clean, flat surface to 1/8-inch thickness to an inch or two wider than your pie  or tart pan. Drape over the tart or pie pan and press the dough into the sides of the pan.\nUse a rolling pin over the top to remove the excess dough and level the dough with the top of the pan. Place in freezer for 30 minutes to an hour.\nIf you want, at this point you can "blind bake" the frozen crust. Blind baking it will help you have a well browned crust on the bottom. I often skip this step because it takes extra time and I don\'t mind having the bottom crust not browned.\nBut, if that is what you want, then line the inside of the frozen crust with aluminum foil and fill to the top with "pie weights", which can be beans, sugar, or rice. The weights are to keep the sides of the pie crust from sliding down when baking.\nBake for 45 minutes at 350\xc2\xb0F, then remove the weights and foil, and let cool a bit before adding the filling. (See our detailed instructions on blind baking.)\n3 Prepare the filling: Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xb0F. Heat oil in a small skillet on medium heat. Add the shallots and cook until translucent, a couple minutes, remove from heat.\nWhisk eggs in a medium bowl. Whisk in goat cheese. Whisk in milk, cream, dill, lemon zest, salt, and black pepper. Whisk in the shallots.\n4 Layer the salmon and filling into the quiche crust: Line the bottom of the quiche crust with half of the smoked salmon. Pour half of the egg/cheese/milk/cream mixture over the salmon in the quiche shell.\nLayer down the remaining salmon, and pour the remaining egg/milk/cream mixture over it.\n5 Bake: Place the quiche pan on a foil-lined rimmed baking sheet. Transfer to oven. Bake at 375\xc2\xb0F for 15 minutes.\nThen lower the heat to 350\xc2\xb0F and bake until just set in the center, about 30 to 40 minutes.\nRemove from oven and cool on a wire rack for 15 minutes before serving.\nHello!

Spread half of the bread cubes in an even layer in the prepared pan. Top with 2/3 of the blueberries, followed by the remaining bread cubes and blueberries.\nIf using frozen blueberries, add them to the casserole while still frozen (do not thaw). This helps prevent the berries from coloring the casserole too much.\n  2 Whisk the liquids: Beat the eggs, milk, cream, vanilla, 6 tablespoons of the sugar, lemon zest, and the salt together. Pour the mixture over the bread cubes, pressing down gently (so you don\xe2\x80\x99t burst the berries) to make sure the egg mixture is absorbed.\n3 Soak at least 30 minutes, or overnight: If soaking overnight, cover the pan with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight.\n4 Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F about 15 minutes before you plan to bake the casserole.\n5 Bake the casserole: Just before baking, sprinkle the top of the casserole with the remaining sugar and dot with the diced butter.

b"Print\nBruschetta with Tomato and Basil Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Makes 24 small slices, serves 6-10 as an appetizer\nUse any flavorful, ripe tomato for this recipe. If you use cherry tomatoes, just quarter them, don't bother blanching or peeling them.\nINGREDIENTS\n6 or 7 ripe tomatoes (about 1 1/2 lbs)\n2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)\n1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar\n6-8 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced* or chopped\n3/4 teaspoon sea salt, more or less to taste\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more or less to taste\n1 baguette French bread or similar Italian bread\n1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil\n*To thinly slice basil leaves, stack the leaves on top of each other and roll up like a cigar. Then make thin slices from one end of the basil cigar to the other.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Blanch and peel the tomatoes: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).\nOnce the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.\nRemove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.\nCut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.\n2 Preheat oven to 450\xc2\xb0F (230\xc2\xb0C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.\n3 Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.\nStir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. Note, tomatoes love salt; you may need to add more than you expect.\n4 Toast the baguette slices: Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.\nThe baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.\nWhen the oven has reached 450\xc2\xb0F (230\xc2\xb0C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.\nIf you want you can toast the bread slices without coating them first in olive oil. Toast them until lightly browned on both sides. Then cut a clove of garlic in half and rub over one side of the toast. Then brush with olive oil. (See Easiest Ever Garlic Bread.)\n5 Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).\nEither serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Print\nCheesy Bruschetta Chicken Cutlets Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 10 minutesYield: 4 servings\nLook for chicken cutlets or thinly sliced chicken breasts next to the chicken breasts and tenders at the grocery store. If you have trouble finding them, you can also make your own by butterflying chicken breasts in half and pounding them flat. You want them to be only a 1/4-inch thick.\nServe this chicken on top of fettuccine or zucchini noodles or alongside steamed rice and vegetables.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the bruschetta topping:\n1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes, drained\n1 clove garlic, minced or pressed in a garlic press\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon Italian seasoning or 1/4 teaspoon each dried basil and oregano\n1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\nFor the chicken:\n1 1/2 pounds (4 cutlets) chicken breast cutlets or thinly sliced chicken breasts, 1/4-inch thick\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n3/4 cup (3 ounces) shredded mozzarella cheese\n1/4 cup (1 ounce) shredded Parmesan cheese\n1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat your oven broiler to its highest setting. Place a rack a few inches below the broiler.\n2 Make the bruschetta topping: In a medium mixing bowl, stir together all of the bruschetta topping ingredients. Set aside.\n3 Sear the chicken: Season the chicken cutlets on both sides with the salt and pepper.\nHeat the olive oil in a large (12-inch), oven-safe skillet over medium high heat. I like to use either a cast iron or stainless steel skillet -- nonstick and enameled cast iron cookware usually aren't meant to be used above 500\xc2\xbaF, so they aren\xe2\x80\x99t broiler safe.\nWhen the oil is shimmering, sear the chicken cutlets for 3 minutes on one side, just so they get a little bit of color.\nIt\xe2\x80\x99s ok if they are not cooked through, since they will finish cooking in the oven.\n4 Flip and season the cutlets: Flip the cutlets over, then spoon on the bruschetta topping and sprinkle with the mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Let them cook in the pan for 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.\n5 Broil the chicken: Place the skillet under the broiler. Broil until the cheese is bubbly and brown and the chicken is cooked through, about 3 minutes.\nCheck for doneness by cutting into one of the cutlets to see if it\xe2\x80\x99s opaque in the center, or by checking the temperature of one of the cutlets with an instant-read thermometer (the chicken should be 165\xc2\xbaF or higher in the center).\nAt this point, your chicken should be ready, but if you used cutlets that were thicker than 1/4-inch you may have to return it to the stovetop to cook for another 1-3 minutes.\n5 Serve: Sprinkle the parsley on top of the chicken and serve the cutlets hot.\nHello!

b"Print\nRoasted Brussels Sprouts Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 35 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Brussels sprouts, rinsed, ends trimmed, and rough outer leaves of larger sprouts removed\n1 tablespoon minced garlic (about 3 cloves)\n1 teaspoon lemon juice (can sub apple cider vinegar)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\nSalt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese (optional)\nMETHOD\n1 Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Prep the Brussels sprouts: Place the trimmed Brussels sprouts in a large bowl. Toss with garlic and lemon juice. Toss the sprouts with olive oil to coat them well.\nSpread the Brussels sprouts out in a large cast iron frying pan or roasting pan in a single layer with plenty of space between them. Sprinkle generously with salt (at least half a teaspoon) and a few turns of black pepper.\n3 Roast in oven: Put the sprouts in oven on the top rack, roast for 25-30 minutes, stirring the sprouts about halfway through the cooking.\nAdjust the timing depending on the size of the sprouts and your particular oven. When the sprouts are ready, they should be nicely browned and some of the outside leaves crunchy. The interior should be cooked through, so that the sprouts are easily pierced with a fork.\nIf the sprouts look like they are getting too browned (they should be well browned, not burnt), move them to a lower rack or lower the heat.\nIf after cooking for 30 minutes the sprouts aren't browned enough, put them under the broiler (or increase the heat to 500\xc2\xb0F) for 5 minutes.\n4 Sprinkle with Parmesan: Toss with Parmesan (if using) and add more salt to taste to serve.\nHello!

Just add an additional tablespoon of butter in step 3.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds Brussels sprouts, trimmed of outer leaves and sliced in half\nSalt\n2 ounces pancetta, diced\n1 tablespoon butter\n3 shallots, peeled, halved, and sliced\n2 tablespoons all purpose flour\n1 3/4 cup whole milk\nScant pinch of freshly ground nutmeg\nThyme leaves from 2 sprigs of thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dry thyme\n4 ounces of grated Gruyere cheese, divided 3 ounces and 1 ounce\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Blanch the Brussels sprouts: Heat a large pot of salted water, 4 quarts of water, 1 tablespoon salt. Blanch the halved Brussels sprouts for 3 to 4 minutes, until just barely tender. Remove from pot, drain, rinse with cold water to stop the cooking, set aside.\n2 Brown the pancetta and render the fat: Place diced pancetta in a large pot on medium low heat. Cook until most of the fat is rendered, about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove the pancetta from the pan, set aside, leaving the rendered fat in the pan.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 shallots: Add butter to the pot and melt on medium heat. Add the shallots and gently cook until softened, about 4 to 5 minutes.\n4 Make roux: Add the flour to the butter shallot mixture to make a roux, whisk for 1 to 2 minutes.\nSlowly add the milk while stirring with a wooden spoon until the roux is incorporated into the milk.\nCook over medium low heat for several minutes, stirring, until the sauce thickens and coats the back of your spoon. Add fresh thyme and sprinkle with nutmeg.\n5 Add cheese, then half of the pancetta to white sauce: Add 3 ounces of grated Gruyere cheese into the white sauce and stir until the cheese is melted and incorporated into the sauce. Add half of  the cooked pancetta back to the sauce. Taste and add more salt if necessary.\n6 Add Brussels sprouts, transfer to gratin dish, sprinkle with pancetta, more cheese, bake: Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. Butter an 8"x12" gratin dish or casserole . Add the Brussels sprouts into the cheese sauce. Transfer the cheesy Brussels sprouts into the casserole or gratin dish. Sprinkle with the remaining pancetta and the remaining 1 ounce of grated Gruyere cheese.\nBake for 25 minutes until top is lightly browned and bubbly.

b'Print\nBrussels Sprouts with Bacon and Chestnuts Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 6-8 as a side\nChestnuts are delicious, but a major pain to roast and shell (have you ever exploded chestnuts all over your kitchen? I have). Canned (jarred more like it) chestnuts actually work better in recipes than the kind you roast and peel yourself. The texture and moisture content is more consistent. So, we suggest using canned roasted chestnuts for this recipe. You can of course roast and shell your own if you prefer.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Brussels sprouts\n1/3 pound thick-sliced bacon or slab bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces or batons\n1 red onion, chopped\n20-25 canned roasted chestnuts, quartered or roughly chopped\n1/4 cup chicken stock\nSalt and pepper to taste\nLemon wedges to serve\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the Brussels sprouts: Cut the Brussels sprouts in half and slice thinly, starting at the top of the sprout and working back toward the stem. Discard the hard tip of the stem side.\n2 Cook the bacon: Cut the bacon into pieces about 1/4 inch wide and put them in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium heat.\nWhen the bacon is browned, remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n3 Cook the onions in bacon fat, add back the bacon:  Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat (do not put down the drain, see how to render bacon fat). Turn up the heat to high, add the red onions. Cook until the onions begin to brown, add back the bacon.\n5 Add chestnuts, Brussels sprouts, stock: Add the chestnuts and Brussels sprouts to the saut\xc3\xa9 pan with the bacon and onions. Add the chicken stock and toss to combine. Stir in about 1 teaspoon of salt, more or less to taste. Cook over high heat for 3-4 minutes. Add pepper to taste.\nServe hot with lemon wedges.

Add the brussels sprouts and parboil them for 3 minutes or until just tender. (You could also steam them if you prefer.) They should be almost cooked all the way through (split one in half to test).\nRemove the sprouts with a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice water for a minute to shock the brussels sprouts and help them retain their bright green color.\nRemove them from the ice water and cut the sprouts into halves.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions, then brussels sprouts: Heat 2-3 Tbsp of butter in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until translucent, about 4-5 minutes.\nAdd 2-3 Tbsp more of butter and the brussels sprouts halves. Increase the heat to medium high and cook for several more minutes. Salt and pepper to taste, while the brussels sprouts are cooking.\nDo not overcook! Overcooked brussels sprouts are bitter and are the main reason why some people don't like them.\n3 Stir in lemon juice, add toasted almonds: Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the lemon juice and half of the toasted almonds.

Either boil them in water in a small saucepan for 45 minutes (or how ever long it takes to get them tender), or wrap them in foil and roast them in the oven at 350\xc2\xb0F for an hour fifteen minutes or until done.\nRoasting will give you better flavor, but takes longer and uses a lot more energy (unless you are already cooking something in the oven).\nWhen done, set the beets aside to cool for 10 minutes, then peel and chop them into 1 x 1/2 inch chunks.\n2 Toast the slivered almonds: While beets are cooking toast your almond slivers if you are starting with raw almonds. Just heat a skillet to medium high heat and put in the almonds. Stir frequently with a spatula. When the almonds begin to brown, remove from pan into a small bowl. Let cool, set aside.\n3 Blanch the Brussels sprouts: Also while the beets are cooking, prepare the Brussels sprouts. Bring 1 1/2 quarts of salted water (2 teaspoons salt) in a medium saucepan to a boil. Add the Brussels sprouts to the water and blanch them for 2-3 minutes. They should be almost all the way cooked through.\nDrain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.

b'Save It Print\nBuckwheat Pancakes Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Makes 14 to 15 4-inch pancakes, serves 2-3\nThe egg is optional, we\'ve made the pancakes both ways, with egg and without. With egg results in just a little more structure to the pancake. To make gluten-free buckwheat pancakes, substitute the all-purpose flour with buckwheat flour.\nDon\'t have buttermilk? You can substitute using 2 Tablespoons of white vinegar stirred into enough regular milk to make 2 cups. (After you stir in the vinegar, let the mixture sit for 5 minutes.) Or you can mix together 1 1/2 cups of plain yogurt and 1/2 cup of milk.\nINGREDIENTS\nVegetable oil for coating the pan\n3/4 cup (100g or 3.5 oz) buckwheat flour\n3/4 cup (100g or 3.5 oz) all-purpose flour (can sub with buckwheat flour for a 100% gluten-free buckwheat pancake if you wish)\n3 Tbsp sugar\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n3 Tbsp unsalted butter, melted\n1 egg (optional)\n2 cups (475 ml) buttermilk\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Pre-heat skillet: Heat a well-seasoned griddle, cast iron skillet, or stick-free pan on medium heat. The pan or griddle should be ready for the batter as soon as it is mixed.\n2 Make pancake batter: Whisk together the dry ingredients\xe2\x80\x94the flours, sugar, salt, baking soda\xe2\x80\x94in a large bowl.\nIn Pour the melted butter over the dry ingredients and start stirring.\nBeat the egg with a fork and stir it into half of the buttermilk. Add the buttermilk/egg mixture to the dry ingredients, then slowly add in the rest of the buttermilk as needed to get to the right consistency for your batter (you may not need all of the buttermilk, depending on what type of buttermilk you are using and the brand of flour).\nStir only until everything is combined. Do not over-mix! A few lumps are fine.\n3 Ladle batter onto hot pan: Put a small amount (a half teaspoon) of vegetable oil on the pan or griddle and spread it around with a paper towel to coat.\nLadle the batter onto the hot surface to the desired size, about 4-5 inches wide. (A 1/4 cup measure will ladle about a 4-inch pancake.) Reduce the heat to medium-low. Allow the pancake to cook for 2-3 minutes on this first side.\n4 Flip pancakes over to other side: Watch for bubbles on the surface of the pancake. When air bubbles start to rise to the surface at the center of the pancake, flip the pancake. Cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until nicely browned.\n5 Keep finished pancakes warm: Keep your pancakes warm on a rack in the oven set on "warm," or stack them on a plate and cover with a towel as you make more. Spread more oil on the pan as needed between batches of pancakes.\nServe with butter and maple syrup.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nBuckwheat Waffles Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Makes 8 to 12 waffles, serves 4 to 5\nThe fluffiness of these waffles is greatly enhanced by whipping the egg whites and folding them into the waffle batter. The whipped egg whites also help to provide structure for the waffles. You can skip this step, but the result will be a little more dense.\nWhen whipping egg whites it's important that everything that touches the egg whites is very clean. Even the smallest amount of fat, butter, or egg yolk can interfere with the whip-ability (is that a word?) of the egg whites. So make sure you separate the eggs carefully, and remove any specks of egg yolk that may have wandered into the whites (it's easiest to do that with a large piece of egg shell).\nYou can substitute the plain yogurt and milk combination with buttermilk.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 1/2 cups buckwheat flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1 teaspoon baking soda\nPinch of salt\nPinch of cinnamon\n2 eggs, separated, plus 2 additional egg whites for extra lightness\n2 Tbsp sugar\n1 cup milk (low fat or regular)\n1/4 cup water\n1 cup plain yogurt\n1/2 cup (1 stick) butter, melted\nExtra pats of butter for serving\nHeated maple syrup for serving\nBerries for serving\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Turn on waffle maker, whisk dry ingredients: Turn on your waffle maker, with the setting on medium. In a large bowl, whisk together the buckwheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and cinnamon.\n2 Beat egg whites: Place the egg whites in a medium bowl and beat with a hand mixer or egg beater. Sprinkle in the sugar as you beat the egg whites.  Beat egg whites until you have soft peaks.\n3 In a medium bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, the melted butter, yogurt, milk, and water.\n4 Combine wet and dry ingredients: Pour the yogurt/milk/butter/egg mixture into the buckwheat flour mixture and stir until just combined. It's okay if it's a little lumpy.\n5 Fold in egg whites: Stir a third of the beaten egg whites into the batter until completely incorporated. Gently fold the remaining beaten egg whites into the batter until just combined, and there are no streaks of egg whites. Be gentle so that you do not deflate the egg whites too much.\n6 Make the waffles: When your waffle maker is ready, working in batches, pour or spoon the batter into the wells, until they almost come to the edge. You will know if you've over-filled it because the batter will spill out of the waffle maker. No harm done, but it's a little messy.\nI like to grease the inside of my waffle maker with a little butter, to help make it easy to remove the waffles.\nCook until the waffle maker indicator indicates that the waffles are ready, or wait until steam stops rising out of the waffle maker. Gently pull the waffles out with a fork.\nAs you make the batches, the batter may thicken while it sits. If you want, thin it out a bit with some water.\nGetting the right balance of doneness is key here. Lightly browned means the waffles will be fluffy, but not crisp. Dark brown means the waffles may be crispy, but a little dry inside. It depends on your preference and your waffle maker. You may need to experiment with a few test waffles to see what works best for you.\n7 Serve: Serve with pads of butter, warmed maple syrup, and fresh berries.\n  Hello!

If any clams are slightly open, tap them on the counter. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t close, throw them out.\n2 Prep the clams: If you harvested the clams yourself or bought them from a small purveyor, soak them in cool, salted water covered with a dish towel for 30 minutes to purge them of sand. Rinse clams in the sink under cool water, rubbing off any dirt with your thumbs.\n3 Make the broth: Heat the olive oil in a large pot or Dutch oven set over medium heat. Add the onion and saut\xc3\xa9 until tender and translucent, about 2 minutes. Add the garlic and chorizo and saut\xc3\xa9 for a few minutes more to infuse the vegetables with smoky flavor.\nAdd the tomatoes, crushed red pepper, white wine, and water, and raise the heat so the liquid boils gently. Cook a few minutes more to soften the tomatoes and allow the flavors to develop.\n4 Cook the clams: Add the clams, cover with a lid, and simmer until the clams open, about 10 minutes. Break the butter into pieces and add to the pan, stir, and scatter with parsley. Turn off the heat.\n5 Toast the bread: While the clams cook, cut several thick slices of bread (one or two slices per person is a good place to start), brush lightly with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt. Toast on a hot grill or under a broiler. This should only take minute or two. When finished set aside to serve with clams.\n6 Serve: Spoon clams and broth in shallow bowls with a slice of bread on the side.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nHow to Steam Hard Boiled Eggs\nCook time: 15 minutes\nThe steaming time will vary depending on the size of your eggs, how cold your eggs are to begin with, the altitude of your location, how vigorous the water is boiling, if your eggs are in a single layer or are stacked, and how soft or firm you like your hard cooked eggs. So you may need to experiment to find the right timing for your situation.\nA steamer basket is convenient, but not necessary.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare pot and steamer basket:  If you are using a steamer basket, fill a saucepan with as much water as needed to reach the bottom of the steamer basket (about 1 inch or so).\nIf you are not using a steamer basket, just fill the bottom of a saucepan with 1/2 inch of water.\n2 Heat water to boiling, add eggs to pot: Heat the water on high heat until it is boiling and producing steam.\nTurn off the heat and gently place the eggs at the bottom of the steamer basket or the bottom of the pan.\nTurn the heat back on again to medium high, and cover the pot.\nThis method works best if the eggs are in a single layer, but you can double them up as well, you'll just need to add more time to the steaming time.\n3 Set your timer and steam the eggs: Set your timer for 6 minutes for soft boiled, 10 minutes for hard boiled with a still translucent and bright yolk, or 12-15 minutes for cooked-through hard boiled.\nIf you have doubled up the eggs in the pan and they are not in a single layer, you may need to add a couple minutes or so to the cooking time for hard boiled.\nThe size large eggs used in these photos were cooked to my satisfaction after 15 minutes when I cooked 6 in a single layer, and 17 minutes when I cooked 12 in the pan.\nNote that many things will influence the steaming time, including altitude and the size of the particular eggs you are using. I recommend removing one egg a couple minutes before you think it should be done, rinsing it with cold water, and breaking it open to see if it is done enough for you.\n4 Remove eggs to a bowl of icy cold water: Remove eggs with a spoon to a bowl of cold water or ice water, or run cold water directly into the pan to cover the eggs and quickly cool them down.\nHello!

Cover with at least an inch of cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes).\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 vegetables: While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.\nIf you are including vegetables, add them according to their cooking time. Carrots should be cooked with the onions, because they take as long to cook as the onions do.\nIf you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time.\n3 Add the ground beef, then Worcestershire sauce and broth: Add ground beef to the pan with the onions and vegetables. Cook until no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper.\nAdd the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out.\n4 Mash the cooked potatoes: When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with the remaining 4 Tbsp of butter. Mash with a fork or potato masher, and season with salt and pepper to taste.\n5 Layer the meat mixture and mashed potatoes in a casserole dish: Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. Spread the beef, onions, and vegetables (if using) in an even layer in a large baking dish (9x13 casserole).\nSpread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef. Rough up the surface of the mashed potatoes with a fork so there are peaks that will get well browned. You can even use a fork to make creative designs in the mashed potatoes.\n6 Bake in oven: Place in a 400\xc2\xb0F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown.\n(Be careful when broiling using Pyrex or glass dishes, they have been known to shatter under the high heat of the broiler. It's not a worry if you are using a ceramic or metal casserole dish.)\nSuggested variations:\nPut a layer of creamed corn between the ground beef and the mashed potatoes.\nSprinkle grated cheddar cheese over the top of the mashed potatoes before baking.\nHello!

Improvise at will depending on the ingredients you have on hand and how much soup you are making.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the stock:\n1 turkey carcass, leftover from carving a whole turkey, including any leftover drippings or giblets (not the liver) if you have them\nCold water\n1 medium to large yellow onion, quartered or cut into thick wedges\n1 to 2 carrots, roughly chopped (can include tops)\nSeveral sprigs of fresh parsley\n1 to 2 sprigs of thyme, or a teaspoon of dried thyme\n1 bay leaf\n1 celery rib (roughly chopped) and some celery tops\n5 to 10 peppercorns\nSalt\nPepper\nFor the soup:\n3 to 4 quarts of the turkey stock you just made\n1 to 1 1/2 cups each, chopped carrots, onion, and celery\nA few sprigs of fresh parsley, leaves chopped (about 2 to 4 Tbsp)\nA couple cloves garlic, minced\n2 teaspoons of poultry seasoning (more to taste) or a combination of ground sage, thyme, marjoram, and/or a bouillon cube\n2 to 4 cups of leftover chopped or shredded cooked turkey meat (don't use any of the meat from making the stock, the goodness will have been cooked out of it by then)\nSalt and pepper to taste\n4 to 8 ounces of egg noodles OR  1/2 to 1 cup dry rice (optional, skip egg noodles for gluten-free version)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nMaking the Turkey Stock\n1 Remove all the usable turkey meat from the turkey carcass to save for making sandwiches later or for adding to the soup once the stock is made.\n2 Put turkey carcass, vegetables, drippings in large pot, cover with water: If you are working with a large turkey carcass, you may want to break up the bones a bit so they fit better in the pot. Place the turkey carcass, neck (if you haven't cooked it with the turkey), leftover skin and bones from dinner, into a large stock pot (at least 8 quart or 12 quart depending on the size of the turkey), and cover with COLD water by an inch.\nAdd any drippings that weren't used to make gravy, and any giblets (not the liver) that haven't been used already. Add thickly sliced onion, some chopped carrots, celery and celery tops, parsley, thyme, a bay leaf, and some peppercorns to the pot.\n3 Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, skim foam: Bring to a boil on high heat and then lower the heat to keep the stock to a bare simmer. Skim off any foamy crud that may float to the surface of the stock.\n(Note in the photo that even though the stock is at a bare simmer, it looks like it is boiling because of the foam that is beginning to come to the surface.)\n4 Add salt and pepper to the pot, about 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of ground black pepper. It sort of depends on how big your turkey is. You can always add salt to the soup later.\n5 Cook for at least 4 hours, partially uncovered, occasionally skimming off any foam that comes to the surface.\n6 Strain the stock: After 4 hours of a low simmer, use tongs, a spider ladle, or a large slotted spoon to remove the bones and vegetables from the pot. Then strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve or strainer.\nIf you have a strainer but it isn't a fine mesh strainer, you can line it with cheesecloth or with several layers of dampened paper towels and strain the stock through that.\n7 Reduce the stock: If making stock for future use in soup you may want to reduce the stock by cooking it longer, uncovered, to make it more concentrated and easier to store.\n(We usually do this step at a rolling boil, and reduce the stock by at least half. When you boil stock it will make it cloudy, but the taste is great so we don't care. If you want to reduce stock and keep it relatively clear, you'll need to do that slowly and a bare simmer, and it will take much longer.)\nMakes 3 to 4 quarts or more of stock, depending on the size of the turkey carcass, and how much water you added to cover it.\nMaking the Turkey Soup\nPrepare the turkey soup much as you would a chicken soup.\n1 Saut\xc3\xa9 carrots, onions, celery in a large pot: In a large soup pot, heat some butter or olive oil (or turkey fat rendered from the stock) on medium high heat. Add chopped carrots, onions, and celery in equal parts (about a cup each). Cook until the onions are softened, about 10 minutes.\n2 Add garlic, stock, parsley, seasonings: Add a couple cloves of garlic, chopped, and cook for a minute more, until the garlic is fragrant. Then add the stock to the pot. Add some parsley and seasoning\xe2\x80\x94salt, pepper, poultry seasoning, sage, thyme, marjoram, and/or a bouillon cube.\n3 Bring to a simmer and cook until the vegetables are cooked through (5 to 10 min).\n4 Add turkey meat, noodles: Add noodles, rice, or even leftover mashed potatoes (skip all of these if you are cooking low-carb). If adding noodles, cook for 4 minutes. If adding rice, cook for 15 minutes.\nTake some of the remaining turkey meat you reserved earlier, shred it into bite sized pieces and add it to the soup. Cook for 1 more minute to warm the turkey meat.\nYou may also want to add some chopped tomatoes, either fresh or canned. Add salt and pepper to taste. Sometimes a dash or two of Tabasco gives the soup a nice little kick.\n  Hello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Add vegetables like celery, onion, carrots, parsley.\nCover with water. Add salt and pepper, about a teaspoon of salt, 1/4 tsp of pepper.\n2 Bring to a boil and immediately reduce heat to bring the stock to barely a simmer. Simmer partially covered at least 4 hours, occasionally skimming off any foam that comes to the surface.\n3 Remove the bones and vegetables with a slotted spoon or spider ladle, and strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve.\n4 If making stock for future use in soup you may want to reduce the stock by simmering an hour or two longer to make it more concentrated and easier to store.\nMETHOD 2: CHICKEN STOCK WITH RAW CHICKEN BACKS, WINGS, AND/OR LEGS\n1 Tbsp olive oil\n4 to 5 lbs of chicken backs, wings, and/or legs, skin-on, trimmed of excess fat, that have been hacked with a cleaver into 2-inch pieces (you can ask your butcher to prepare the chicken pieces this way)\n1 large yellow onion, quartered (no need to peel)\n1 large carrot, cut into 2-inch segments\nCelery tops and 1 large celery rib, cut into 2-inch segments\n1 bunch of parsley\nLeek or green onion greens (if you have them)\n1 bay leaf\n6 quarts of cold water\n1 Tbsp salt\n1 Coat the bottom of a large stock pot (12 quart), with olive oil. Place half of the chicken pieces, skin side down in the bottom of the pot. Heat on medium high, and let cook until the the chicken is browned. Add the rest of the chicken pieces and stir the pot, cooking and occasionally stirring until the chicken is no longer pink.\n2 Add the onion, carrot, celery, parsley, leek greens (if using), and bay leaf to the pot. Cover with 6 quarts of cold water.\n3 Bring to a boil on high heat and reduce to a low simmer. If scum rises to the surface of the pot (this usually happens in the first half hour of cooking), skim off with a large metal spoon. Let simmer at a low simmer, uncovered, for 4 to 6 hours.\n4 Use a large metal spoons with holes in it (or a "spider ladle") to ladle out the cooked chicken and vegetables. (These aren\'t really good to eat, by the way, because after 4 hours of cooking, most of the flavor and nutrients have been cooked out of them and are now in the stock.) Discard.\n5 Use a large sieve lined with dampened cheesecloth or a dampened paper towel (or if using a very fine mesh sieve no need to line), and place over a large bowl or another large pot. Pour the stock through the sieve into the bowl or pot to strain out any remaining solids.\n6 Either pour into jars at this point, or if you want, what we like to do is to boil the stock on high heat for 1 hour, to reduce it by about half. This way you are storing concentrated stock, which takes less room in the freezer or refrigerator. When you are ready, pour into jars.\nIf you are freezing, you may want to ladle off some of the excess fat on the surface. (The fat helps preserve the stock in the fridge, but doesn\'t help it in the freezer.) If freezing, leave at least 1-inch head space, allowing enough room for the liquid stock to expand as it freezes solid. (Otherwise, the expanding ice stock will break the jar.)\nLet the stock cool completely before refrigerating or freezing. Stock should last a week or so in the fridge, and several months in the freezer.\nMETHOD 3: QUICK CHICKEN STOCK\n4 lbs of chicken backs, wings, and/or legs that have been hacked with a cleaver into 2-inch pieces. You can ask your butcher to prepare the chicken pieces this way.\n1 large yellow onion, chopped\nOlive oil\n2 quarts of boiling water\n2 teaspoons of salt\n2 bay leaves\n1 Heat 1 Tbsp of olive oil in a large stock pot. Add one chopped onion. Saut\xc3\xa9 until softened and slightly colored - 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.\n\n\n2 Add half of the chicken pieces to the pot. Saut\xc3\xa9 until no longer pink, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer cooked chicken to bowl with onions. Saut\xc3\xa9 the rest of the chicken the same way. Return onion and chicken pieces to the pot. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until chicken releases its juices, about 20 minutes.\n3 While the chicken pieces are cooking, fill a large tea kettle with 2 quarts of water, bring to a boil.\n4 After the chicken pieces have been cooking for 20 minutes, raise the heat level to high, add the 2 quarts of boiling water, 2 teaspoons of salt, 2 bay leaves. Return to a low simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, then cover and barely simmer for about 20 minutes.\n5 Strain stock through cheesecloth or paper towel-lined large sieve, and discard solids. (It helps to remove the big pieces of bone with a slotted spoon first.)\nPour into jars and cool completely before refrigerating or freezing. Stock will last a week or so in the refrigerator or frozen for several months.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Transfer to a plate.\n2 Snip the tomatoes: Open the can of tomatoes and use a large pair of scissors to snip and break them up in the can into chunky pieces. You will mash them a little more in the skillet.\n3 Make the sauce: In the same skillet you used to brown the sausage, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and oregano. Cook for 30 seconds, or until the garlic sizzles. Add the tomatoes with their juices, salt, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the sauce is hot.\nUse a potato masher to break up the tomatoes into smaller pieces (this is easiest to do when tomatoes soften in the heat). You are aiming for a chunky sauce.\nAdd the sausage back to the pan and cook for 10 minutes. Taste, and add more salt and sugar, if you like.\n4 Make the ricotta mixture: Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir the egg, ricotta, Parmesan, nutmeg, and pepper together.\n5 Preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. Brush or spray a 4x8-inch loaf pan with oil.\n6 Assemble the lasagna: In the bottom of the loaf pan, ladle about 1/2 cup tomato-sausage sauce. Top with 1 noodle. Spread with 1/2 cup sauce, and then spread 1/3 mounded cup of the ricotta mixture over it.\nPlace a second noodle on top of the sauce. Spread 1/3 mounded cup ricotta mixture over it, and top with 1/2 cup tomato-sausage sauce.\nPlace a third noodle on top of the sauce. Spread with remaining ricotta and spoon 1/2 cup tomato-sausage sauce over it, using up all of the remaining sausage pieces in this layer.\nPlace a fourth noodle on top of the sauce and spoon the remaining sauce on top. Sprinkle with the mozzarella.\n6 Bake the lasagna: Place the loaf pan on a baking sheet. Fold a large piece of foil in half and fold it in half again. Make a tent over the loaf pan (so it does not stick to the cheese.) Bake for 25 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the oven and remove the foil tent. Check to see if the lasagna is uneven or if it peaks in the middle. If it\xe2\x80\x99s uneven, use the back of a spoon to press the top layer lightly to make it level in the loaf pan and submerge the noodles in the sauce.\nTurn the oven down to 375\xc2\xb0F. Return lasagna to the oven and continue to bake for 15 minutes, or until the sauce bubbles and the cheese is golden brown. (If you like stretchy rather than browned cheese, check after 10 minutes.)\n7 To serve: Allow the lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with chopped parsley, if you like.\nHello!

b'Print\nMozzarella and Basil Stuffed Tomatoes Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Makes 8 stuffed tomato cups, 4 servings\nIf preparing gluten-free, use gluten-free bread or bread crumbs.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 medium tomatoes with firm, fleshy walls, 2 1/2 inches wide\n1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese\n1/3 cup grated parmesan cheese, divided\n1/4 cup packed fresh basil, chopped, plus more for garnish\n1 slice of bread (enough to make 1/4 cup breadcrumbs)\n1 tablespoon melted salted butter\n1 teaspoon minced garlic\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/8 teaspoon pepper\nOlive oil for drizzling\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Make the soft breadcrumbs: To make the 1/4 cup soft breadcrumbs, remove the crust from 1 slice of bread (preferably stale) and either pulse in a small food processor or shred with a fork until the bread resembles fine, sand-like crumbs.\n3 Prepare the tomatoes: Slice the tomatoes in half horizontally around the equator and use a spoon to scoop out the flesh. Be careful not to puncture the walls of the tomato, but if you do, the filling will plug the hole. Place empty tomato halves in a casserole dish and season with salt and pepper.\nUsing your hands or a spoon, separate the seeds from the scooped out tomato flesh and transfer the flesh to a cutting board. Discard the seeds and the tomato water. Chop the flesh and set aside for the stuffing.\n4 Make the stuffing: In a medium bowl, add the mozzarella cheese, 1/4 cup of the parmesan cheese, basil, breadcrumbs, butter, garlic, salt, and pepper and stir to thoroughly combine.\n5 Bake: Using two spoons, fill the tomato halves with the stuffing. Sprinkle filled tomatoes with the remaining parmesan cheese and drizzle with olive oil. Bake for 15 minutes, or until tomatoes are tender, then broil on high for 1 minute until the filling begins to bubble and brown.\n6 Serve: Garnish with a few torn basil leaves and serve hot.\nHello!

b"Print\nSouthern Cornbread Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Makes 8 servings\nWhite cornmeal is used in most Southern cornbreads, but we could not find any here in California, so we used yellow cornmeal. If you can find white cornmeal, by all means use it.\nThe egg is optional, though without it the cornbread will be very crumbly.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon bacon drippings\n2 cups cornmeal OR 1 1/2 cups cornmeal and 1/2 cup flour\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon sugar (optional)\n1 large egg (optional)\n1 1/4 cups buttermilk\n6 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat pan with bacon drippings: Put the bacon drippings in a 9 or 10-inch well-seasoned cast iron skillet and put the skillet into the oven. Then preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F with the skillet inside. (If you don't have an iron skillet, you can use an uncovered Dutch oven or a metal cake pan.)\n2 Make the batter: Whisk together all the dry ingredients (cornmeal, baking soda, salt, sugar if using) in a large bowl. In another bowl, beat the egg (if using) and buttermilk until combined, then mix that into the bowl of dry ingredients. Stir in the melted butter.\n3 Pour batter into hot skillet and bake: When the oven is hot, take out the skillet (carefully, as the handle will be hot!). Add the cornbread batter and make sure it is evenly distributed in the skillet.\nBake at 400\xc2\xb0F for about 20 minutes, or until the edges are beginning to brown and a toothpick inserted in the center of the bread comes out clean.\n4 Rest bread in skillet, then serve: Let the bread rest for 10 to 30 minutes in the skillet before cutting it into wedges and serving.\nTo store, let the cornbread cool, then remove from pan and wrap in plastic wrap or transfer to an airtight container. Store at room temp for 2 to 3 days\nTo avoid burning your hand because you've forgotten the pan is hot, I recommend placing a pot holder on the pan's handle while the cornbread is resting, or cooling the handle down a bit with an ice cube.\nHello!

Add the pasta and cook according to package directions until cooked through, but still firm (al dente).\n2 Cook the onions and chili pepper flakes: While the water is coming to a boil and the pasta is cooking, prepare the rest of the recipe. In a large, wide saut\xc3\xa9 pan, heat a couple tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Add the chopped onion and chili pepper flakes and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes or so.\n3 Mix in the canned tuna, the capers, and the salt. Add the wine, bring to a simmer then lower the heat to low. Cook for 10 minutes or longer, while the pasta is cooking.

b'Print\nHow to Make a Grilled Cheese Sandwich\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 5 minutesYield: 1 sandwich\nINGREDIENTS\n3 ounces (about 2/3 to 1 cup) shredded cheddar, swiss, jack, or fontina cheese\n2 slices sandwich bread, preferably 1/2-inch thick\n2 teaspoons mayonnaise or butter\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the pan and grate the cheese: Put a heavy-bottomed medium skillet over medium-low to medium heat (everyone\xe2\x80\x99s stove is a little different). As the skillet heats, grate the cheese. If you are using more than one kind of cheese, toss them together in a bowl until nicely combined.\n2 Mayo or butter the bread: Spread one side of each slice of bread evenly with mayonnaise or butter. Lay the slices butter-side-down in the preheated skillet.\n3 Add the cheese and let it melt: Distribute the cheese evenly over both slices of bread. If you have a lid for your skillet, put it on; this will help the cheese melt more evenly.\nNow, stay put! The second you walk away is the second your sandwich will burn. Look for the cheese to begin melting. The time it takes will depend on your stove, your skillet, and the cheese you are using. Lower-moisture cheeses like aged cheddar will take longer to melt. It could take 2 minutes, or up to 5 minutes. You don\xe2\x80\x99t want the cheese to be totally melted\xe2\x80\x94just halfway melted.\n4 Close the sandwich and finish grilling: (If you want to add a filling, like sliced tomato, add it now.) Close the sandwich and continue grilling, flipping the sandwich with a turner as needed, until both sides are golden brown, another 2-3 minutes per side.\nUsually, the second side takes less time than the first. Press down on the sandwich gently but firmly with your turner to compact it a little, but don\xe2\x80\x99t smoosh it. You may need to turn the heat down to medium-low to keep the bread from charring.\nPeek in the sandwich to see if the cheese is fully melted. If the bread is grilled to your liking but the cheese needs more time, turn the heat down and grill it a few minutes longer.\n5 Serve the sandwich: Cut the sandwich the way you like best (I like cutting on the diagonal, creating four pointy corners to dip in tomato soup) and let it cool a minute or so before eating, unless you like burning your mouth on molten cheese. Serve immediately.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'

If you use a ham bone, you'll add the chopped ham at the end of cooking. If you are using a ham shank, after the soup cooks with the ham shank, you'll need to remove it, cut away the meat, chop the meat, and return it to the soup.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 1/2 cups chopped onion\n3/4 cup chopped parsnips or carrots\n3/4 cup chopped celery\n1 minced garlic clove\n1 meaty ham bone from a ham, or a meaty ham shank\n6 cups low sodium chicken stock\n2 bay leaves\n2 sprigs thyme\n2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled, and cut into 3/4-inch cubes\n1 1/2 cups cubed ham (if using a ham bone), 3/4-inch dice\n1/2 teaspoon ground pepper\n1/4 cup whipping cream\nSalt to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook onions, parsnips or carrots, celery, garlic in olive oil: Heat olive oil in a large, thick-bottomed pot or Dutch oven on medium high heat.\nAdd the onions, parsnips or carrots, celery, and saut\xc3\xa9 for 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a minute more.\n2 Add ham bone or shank, stock, bay leaves, thyme: Add the ham bone or ham shank to the pot. Add 6 cups of stock. Add bay leaves and thyme.

b'Print\nHow to Cook Rice on the Stovetop\nCook time: 20-25 minutesYield: 4 servings, or about 4 cups fluffed, cooked rice\nThis recipe is for regular long-grain white rice. Quick-cooking, parboiled, and converted rice will have different cooking times and may call for different amounts of liquid.\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t want to rinse the rice, increase the amount of liquid to 2 cups.\nYou can safely double this recipe in the same size saucepan.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup long-grain white rice\n1 3/4 cup water\n1/4 teaspoon salt, optional\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Rinse the rice: Put the rice in a wire mesh sieve or strainer and rinse it under cold water for about 30 seconds, or until the water runs clear. Swish it around to get the excess water off.\n2 Combine the rice and liquid: In a medium saucepan (about 2 quarts), combine the rice and water. Add the salt, if using.\n3 Cover and bring to a boil: Put on the lid. Turn the heat to medium-high and bring the rice to a boil. The liquid can quickly boil over and make a big mess, so watch the pot for steam, or listen for the lid making jiggling sounds.\n4 Turn down the heat and set the timer: Once the rice comes to a boil, set a timer for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to medium-low, or as low as it can go while still maintaining a very gentle simmer (look for wisps of steam around the lid). It\xe2\x80\x99s okay to take off the lid a few times to check on the progress of the rice but try to keep it to a minimum.\n6 Turn off the burner and let the rice steam: Turn off the heat. Let the rice sit with the lid on for 10 minutes so it can steam. Even though the pot is not on the heat, this is part of your cooking time. It\xe2\x80\x99s what makes the rice nice and fluffy, like restaurant rice.\n7 Fluff and serve: Use a fork or spoon to fluff the rice before serving it.\nHello!

b"Print\nClassic Baked Chicken\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 50 minutesYield: Serves 4\nEven if you intend to eat the baked chicken without its skin, leave the skin on for baking because it prevents the chicken pieces from drying out while they bake.\nIf you bought a whole chicken to start with, the chicken may have come with the neck and gizzards (often in paper in the cavity of the chicken). Use the chicken back and these giblets to make stock for gravy. Chop up the back a little, and put the back, gizzard, and neck into a small saucepan and cover with water by a half inch or so. Bring to a simmer and let simmer while your chicken is baking. Then strain and use the stock for making a richly flavored gravy.\nINGREDIENTS\nOne 3 to 4 pound chicken, cut into 8 parts (2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 legs, 2 wings), excluding the back\nExtra virgin olive oil\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/2 cup low sodium chicken stock (see Recipe Note) or white wine for the gravy (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Trim and salt the chicken: Trim the chicken pieces of excess fat. Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle all sides with salt. Let the chicken pieces sit for 15 to 20 minutes to take the chill off.\n2 Preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C).\n3 Prep the chicken: Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel. Rub olive oil over the chicken pieces and on the bottom of the roasting pan.\nSprinkle the chicken pieces all over with black pepper and a little more salt.\nArrange the chicken pieces in the pan so that all the pieces are skin-side up, and the largest pieces (the breasts) are in the center of the pan.\nDon't crowd the pan; allow room in between the pieces.\n4 Bake the chicken: Bake (uncovered) in the oven for 30 minutes at 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C). This initial high heat will help brown the chicken.\nThen lower the heat to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) and bake for and additional 10-30 minutes more until the juices run clear (not pink) when poked with a sharp knife or the internal temperature of the chicken breasts is 165\xc2\xb0F (74\xc2\xb0C), and of the thighs is 170\xc2\xb0F (77\xc2\xb0C) when tested with a meat thermometer.\nIf the chicken isn't browning well enough, place the chicken under the broiler for the last 5 minutes of cooking, until browned sufficiently.\n5 Let it rest: Remove from oven and transfer the chicken to a serving dish. Tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.\n6 Make gravy: If you would like to make gravy with the drippings from the chicken, place the roasting pan with all its drippings on the stovetop and set the burner to medium heat.\nUse a metal spatula to scrape up the stuck drippings from the bottom of the pan. When the pan is hot, pour in some white wine or chicken stock to help loosen the drippings from the pan.\nTransfer the drippings and stock/wine mixture to a saucepan and heat on medium high until reduced to your desired thickness.\nIf you want the gravy even thicker, you can make a slurry with a little cornstarch or flour (a teaspoon) and water (1/4 cup), and add that to the gravy while it cooks.\n7 Serve: Serve with steamed rice, mashed potatoes, or Spanish rice.\nHello!

Once the water is boiling, salt it with 2 Tbsp of salt. Once the water returns to a boil add the pasta to the pot.\nLeave uncovered, let cook on high heat with a vigorous boil. Put the timer on for 8-10 minutes, or whatever your pasta package says is appropriate for al dente (cooked but still a little firm). Drain.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions, garlic, with seasonings: Once you've started to heat the water, start working on the sauce. Heat olive oil in a very large skillet on medium heat. Add the chopped onion, Italian seasoning and red pepper flakes.\nCook for 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are softened. Add the garlic, fresh thyme, season with salt and pepper. Cook for an additional minute, until the garlic is fragrant. Remove from heat and set aside.\n3 Brown the ground beef: Heat a large cast iron pan on high heat. Salt the bottom of the pan generously. Once the pan is hot, break up small chunks of ground beef and add them to the pan, without stirring. (You may need to work in batches; do not crowd the pan.) You want the meat to get well browned.\nIf the pan is too hot and the meat is burning, not browning, take the pan off the heat for a little, and reduce the heat to medium high. On our coil electric stove, it takes the high heat setting for the meat to brown sufficiently, but your stove may be different.\nOnce the meat is browned on one side (a couple of minutes), use a metal spatula to flip the meat over to brown on the other side. At this point, assuming you are using a cast iron pan, you can remove the pan from the heat. The residual heat in the pan will finish cooking the meat.\n4 Add beef and tomato sauce to onions: Use a slotted spoon to lift the meat from the cast iron pan and add it to the pan with the seasoned onions.\nAdd tomato sauce. Use the edge of your metal spatula to break up the bigger chunks of meat into smaller pieces.\nAdd basil. Add a teaspoon of sugar. Bring to a simmer on low heat, let cook, uncovered, for 15 minutes.\n5 Adjust seasonings and add the pasta: Once the sauce has simmered for 15 minutes, adjust seasonings. Add salt and pepper to taste. Add a little more sugar if the sauce is too acidic. Add more tomato sauce if the sauce is a little dry. Stir in the cooked penne pasta. Sprinkle with chopped parsley.

b"Print\nHamburger Stroganoff Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 4\nYou can substitute the sour cream and lemon juice for a cup of full-fat plain yogurt (room temperature). Do not allow to boil.\nINGREDIENTS\nButter\n1 pound ground chuck beef\nSalt and pepper\n1 yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup)\n8 ounces sliced cremini mushrooms (can substitute button mushrooms), sliced\n1/3 cup of dry sherry, dry white wine, or water\n1/2 cup chopped parsley, loosely packed\n1 1/4 cups full fat sour cream (room temperature)\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\n1/4 teaspoon paprika or more to taste\n8 ounces egg noodles\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat pasta water: Put a large pot of salted water (1 teaspoon salt for every quart of water) on to heat, for the pasta.\n2 Brown the ground beef: Heat a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium high heat. Melt 1 teaspoon butter in the pan and swirl it around.\nWorking in batches as not to crowd the meat (crowding it will make it hard to brown), break up the ground beef and add it to the pan. Sprinkle the meat with salt. Do not stir the meat, as stirring will prevent browning.\nOnce the meat is well browned on one side (a couple minutes, depending on how hot the pan), use tongs or a fork or a metal spatula to flip to the other side.\nOnce that side is browned as well, use a slotted spoon to remove from the pan and set aside.\nContinue to brown the meat in batches, adding a teaspoon of butter to the pan with each batch if needed, and salting the pan and the meat, until it is all browned. Remove meat from pan. Drain excess fat from pan.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions: Add the onions to the pan. If you are working with very lean meat, you may not have any residual fat in the pan. If this is the case, you'll want to add in a tablespoon of olive oil or butter to the pan.\nCook the onions, scraping up the meat drippings, until soft, about 5 minutes. Remove onions from the pan (add to the meat).\n4 Start cooking pasta: Depending on the cooking times of your particular brand of pasta, this is likely a good time to add the pasta to the (should be now) boiling, salted water.\n5 Saut\xc3\xa9 mushrooms, add sherry: While the pasta is cooking, add a tablespoon of butter to the pan, increase the heat to medium high. Add the sliced mushrooms. Saut\xc3\xa9 until nicely browned (about 4 minutes).\nAdd the sherry (or dry white wine or water) to the pan to deglaze the pan, scraping up any browned bits. Let the sherry reduce by at least a half, then lower the heat to low.\n6 Stir in sour cream, paprika, lemon juice, meat, onions, parsley: Remove the pan from the heat. Mix in the sour cream and paprika until smooth. Return the pan to very low heat, and not let the sour cream boil (or it may curdle). You may add a few tablespoons of water to the mixture to thin it out a bit at any time.\nStir in the lemon juice, and about 1/4-1/2 teaspoon of salt (taste).\nStir in the meat and onions. Stir in the chopped parsley. Add more salt, pepper, and/or paprika to taste.\n7 Serve with noodles: Keep the stroganoff on warm heat until the noodles are done cooking. When the noodles are ready (al dente) drain.\nServe the hamburger stroganoff on top of egg noodles.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nChicken Paprikash Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 35 minutesYield: Serves 4-6\nWe like cooking chicken skin-on and bone-in, but this recipe will easily work with boneless, skinless chicken pieces as well, if that's what you prefer.\nPaprika can go flat and tasteless if it is too old. So check your paprika first, before starting this dish.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 to 2 1/2 pounds of chicken pieces, preferably thighs and legs\nSalt\n2-3 Tbsp unsalted butter\n2 pounds yellow onions, (about 2-3 large onions)\nBlack pepper to taste\n2 Tbsp sweet paprika, preferably Hungarian\n1 teaspoon (or to taste), hot paprika or cayenne\n1 cup chicken broth\n1/2 cup sour cream\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Salt the chicken pieces well and let them sit at room temperature while you cut the onions. Slice the onions lengthwise (top to root).\n2 Brown the chicken pieces: Heat a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium-high heat and melt the butter. When the butter is hot, pat the chicken pieces dry with paper towels and place them skin-side down in the pan.\nLet the chicken pieces cook 4-5 minutes on one side, until well browned, then turn them over and let them cook 2-3 minutes on the other side. (Take care when turning so as not to tear the skin if any is sticking to the pan.)\nRemove the chicken from the pan to a bowl, set aside.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions: Add the sliced onions to the saut\xc3\xa9 pan and cook them, stirring occasionally, scraping up the browned bits from the chicken, until lightly browned, about 7 minutes.\n4 Add the paprika and some black pepper to the onions and stir to combine. Let cook for a minute.\n5 Add the chicken broth, place chicken on onions, cover and cook: Add the chicken broth, again scraping up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan, and then nestle the chicken pieces into the pan, on top of the onions.\nCover and cook on a low simmer for 20-25 minutes (depending on the size of your chicken pieces).\nWhen the chicken is cooked through (165\xc2\xb0F if you use a thermometer, or if the juices run clear, not pink when the thickest part of the thigh is pierced with a knife) remove the pan from the heat.\n(If you want, you can also keep cooking the chicken until it begins to fall off the bone, which may take another 30 minutes or so.)\n6 Remove chicken, stir in sour cream: When the chicken is done to your taste, remove the chicken from the pan. Allow the pan to cool for a minute and then slowly stir in the sour cream and add salt to taste.\nIf the sour cream cools the sauce too much, turn the heat back on just enough to warm it through. Add the chicken back to the pan and coat with the sauce.\n7 Serve: Serve with dumplings, rice, egg noodles or potatoes. (If cooking gluten-free, serve with rice, potatoes or gluten-free noodles or dumplings.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nSlow Cooked Boston Baked Beans Recipe\nCook time: 8 hoursYield: Serves 5-6 as a main dish or 10-12 as a side\nWhy pre-soak the beans? You don't have to (see this great Russ Parsons article in the LA Times about why you don't need to soak beans), but not doing so in this recipe will increase the cooking time. With the beans pre-soaked, they'll still take 8 hours to cook and soften in a slow-cooker. Once beans come in contact with the molasses, the sugar in the molasses will keep the beans firm. That's why they take so long to cook.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound (2 to 2 1/4 cups) dry white beans such as Navy beans or Great Northern beans (can also use kidney beans)\n1/3 cup molasses\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n3-4 Tbsp Dijon mustard\n1/8 teaspoon ground cloves\n3 cups hot water\n1/2 pound salt pork (can sub bacon), cut into 1/2-inch to 1-inch pieces\n1 medium onion, (1 1/2 cups) chopped\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Soak beans in water: Place beans in a large pot and cover with 2 inches of water. Soak overnight and drain. Alternatively, bring a pot with the beans covered with 2 inches of water to a boil, remove from heat and let soak for a hour, then drain.\n2 Mix molasses, brown sugar, mustard, ground cloves with water: Whisk together the molasses, brown sugar, mustard, and ground cloves with 3 cups of hot water.\n3 Add ingredients to slow-cooker, layering them, starting with the salt pork: Line the bottom of a slow-cooker (or a Dutch oven if you are cooking in the oven) with half of the salt pork (pick the fattiest pieces). Layer over with half of the drained beans. Add all of the chopped onion in a layer.\nTop with another layer of beans and the remaining salt pork. Pour the molasses water mixture over the beans to just cover the beans.\n4 Slow cook until beans are tender: Cover and cook in a slow-cooker on the low setting for 8 hours (or in a 250\xc2\xb0F oven), until the beans are tender. Check the water level a few hours in, and if the beans need more water, add some. Add additional salt to taste if needed.\nNote that fresher beans will cook faster than older beans. Your beans may be ready in less than 8 hours, or they may take longer. Best the next day.\nServe with Boston brown bread.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nBean and Bacon Soup Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesBean soaking time: 8 hoursYield: Serves 6 to 8\nIn this recipe we are making the bean soup starting with dry beans that we soak overnight. If you don't have time to soak beans overnight, you can put the beans into a pot of water, bring the water to a boil, remove from heat, and let sit for hour, and then drain. Pre-soaking the beans will help them cook faster.\nIf you would rather work with canned beans, use 3 to 4 15-ounce cans of drained white beans and cook them in step 3 for only 15 minutes, not an hour.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound dry Great Northern white beans, covered with a couple inches of water and soaked overnight\n5 ounces of bacon, cut into 1/2-inch wide pieces\n2 cups chopped onion (1 large onion)\n3/4 cup chopped celery (about 2 ribs of celery)\n3/4 cup chopped carrots (1 large carrot)\n3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)\n6 cups chicken stock\n2 bay leaves\n1 Tbsp fresh thyme\n2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n3 Tbsp tomato paste\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n1 ounce bacon (1 to 2 slices), cooked and crumbled for garnish (optional)\n2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Drain the beans: Drain the beans that have been soaking in water. (If you haven't already soaked the beans, and you don't have time to do so overnight, you can put them in a large pot of water, bring to a boil, remove from heat and let sit for an hour, then drain.)\n2 Cook the bacon and vegetables: Put the bacon into a large (5 to 6 quart) thick-bottomed Dutch oven on medium high heat. Let the bacon cook for a minute or two to start rendering out some of its fat, then add the chopped onion, celery, and carrots.\nLower the heat to low, cover and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, until vegetables are completely cooked through and softened. Add the garlic and cook a minute more.\n3 Add beans, stock, seasonings, simmer: Add the drained beans to the pot. Add the stock, the bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper.\nIncrease heat to high to bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour or until the beans are very soft.\n4 Add tomato paste and paprika: Stir in the tomato paste and the paprika. Cook for 5 more minutes.\n5 Pur\xc3\xa9e half the soup: Remove the bay leaves. Using an immersion blender, pur\xc3\xa9e most of the soup. You don't want the soup to be perfectly smooth, but you want to pur\xc3\xa9e enough of it so that the beans create a creamy base.\nAdd more salt and pepper to taste.\nGarnish with crumbled cooked bacon and chopped parsley to serve.\nHello!

Let sit overnight.\nAlternatively, if you don't have time to soak the beans overnight, place the dry beans in a large bowl and pour boiling water over the beans, covering the beans with at least an inch of water, and let sit for one hour.\nNote, if your dry beans are a little old, or if you have reason to believe that they will be tough to cook (beans stored in hot or humid climates can get tough), you can add some salt to the water (1 1/2 teaspoons of salt 2 quarts of water) which at this stage will help the beans soften when they cook later.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 cumin, onion, garlic:  Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large thick-bottomed pot (the pot you will use to cook the beans) on medium high heat.\nAdd the cumin. Once the cumin is sizzling, add the chopped onion. Cook for 5 minutes or so, until translucent. Add the minced garlic and cook for a minute more.\n3 Add drained beans and water, simmer 2 hours: Once the beans have soaked, they should have expanded noticeably. Drain the soaking liquid.\nAdd the drained beans and 2 quarts of water to the onions. Bring to a simmer. Partially cover the pot and lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Simmer for 2 hours.\n4 Add Salt and Cilantro, cook 30 min more: After the beans have simmered for 2 hours, add 2 teaspoons of salt (if you salted the soaking water in step 1, then taste first, and only add a teaspoon or so more of salt if you think it needs it).\nAdd 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro. Let cook uncovered for another half hour, or until the beans are tender.\n5 Saut\xc3\xa9 the spices, then add onions and cook: Heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil in a large frying pan on medium high heat. Add the chipotle powder, chili powder, and cumin.\nOnce the spices are sizzling, add the chopped white onion and cook until translucent.\nAdd the garlic and cook a minute more.\n6 Add beans, then mash: Add the cooked black beans (and liquid from the pot) to the frying pan. Use a potato masher to mash the beans in the pan.  Let them cook 3 to 4 minutes longer.\nIf the beans are a little soupy for your taste, just let them cook longer. If too thick or dry, add more water. Adjust seasonings to taste.\n7 Serve: Garnish with chopped green onions, fresh cilantro, and crumbled cotija or queso fresco cheese.\nServe with tortilla chips or corn or flour tortillas (corn if you are gluten-free).

b"Print\nMom\xe2\x80\x99s Stuffed Bell Peppers Recipe\nYield: Serves 4 to 6\nRed and yellow bell peppers have a very different flavor than green bell peppers. The red ones especially are much sweeter. Any bell pepper can be used for this recipe; use the type you like the best.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 1/2 to 2 cups cooked white rice (starting from about 3/4 to 1 cup raw white rice)\n4 to 6 bell peppers (red, yellow, or green), use 4 large, or 6 medium sized\n1 to 1 1/4 pound of ground beef (ground chuck, 16% fat)\n6 large fresh basil leaves, chopped (or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil)\n1/2 teaspoon dry summer savory or thyme\n1/2 teaspoon ground marjoram (or 2 teaspoons of fresh chopped)\n(Can substitute herbs with other herbs such as an Italian herb mix)\n1 teaspoon salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\nPaprika\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the rice: If you haven't already made the rice, start cooking the rice following the package instructions (usually 1 cup of raw white rice plus 1 1/2 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, bring to boil, reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 15 minutes.)\n2 Steam the bell peppers: Cut the tops off of the bell peppers. Remove and discard (compost) the stem and seeds.\nPlace bell peppers cut side up on a steaming rack over an inch of water in a large covered pot. Bring to boil, let steam for 10 minutes. (Note you can skip this step if you want, but steaming the pepper shells first will make them more tender and easier to eat.)\n3 Mix the filling: Heat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. In a large bowl mix together the ground beef, basil, summer savory, marjoram, salt, several turns of black pepper, and the cooked rice.\n4 Fill the bell peppers: Remove bell peppers from steamer pan. Place cut side up in a pyrex or other oven-proof casserole. Gently stuff the peppers with the ground beef rice mixture.\nDrizzle olive oil over the stuffed peppers, along the outside of the peppers, and into the pan. Rub the oil over the outside of the peppers; it will help with browning. Sprinkle the tops generously with paprika.\n5 Bake: Place on the middle rack of the oven and bake at 350\xc2\xb0F for 35-50 minutes, or longer, until the meat is cooked through.\nServe with ketchup.\nHello!

In another bowl mix together the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, parsley, salt, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, and pepper.\n4 Dredge chicken pieces in butter and Parmesan mixture: Piece by piece, dip the chicken pieces into the garlic melted butter, and then dredge into the Parmesan breadcrumb mixture to coat.\nNote that if your chicken pieces are cold, they may cause the melted butter to thicken, leaving too much butter sticking the chicken pieces. If you see this happening, just reheat the butter.\n5 Place chicken on roasting dish: Place coated chicken pieces on to a 9x13 (or larger) roasting dish. Try to leave a little room between each piece. (You may need to use more than one roasting pan.) Drizzle with remaining garlic butter.\n6 Bake: Bake uncovered at 450\xc2\xb0F 15 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Note that the chicken will get much more browned on the bottom side than on the top.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Let sit overnight.\nAlternatively, if you don't have time to soak the beans overnight, place the dry beans in a large bowl and pour boiling water over the beans, covering the beans with at least an inch of water, and let sit for one hour.\nNote, if your dry beans are a little old, or if you have reason to believe that they will be tough to cook (beans stored in hot or humid climates can get tough), you can add some salt to the water (1 1/2 teaspoons of salt 2 quarts of water) which at this stage will help the beans soften when they cook later.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 cumin, onion, garlic:  Heat a tablespoon of olive oil in a large thick-bottomed pot (the pot you will use to cook the beans) on medium high heat.\nAdd the cumin. Once the cumin is sizzling, add the chopped onion. Cook for 5 minutes or so, until translucent.

Simmer for 2 hours.\n4 Add Salt and Cilantro, cook 30 min more: After the beans have simmered for 2 hours, add 2 teaspoons of salt (if you salted the soaking water in step 1, then taste first, and only add a teaspoon or so more of salt if you think it needs it).\nAdd 1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro. Let cook uncovered for another half hour, or until the beans are tender.\n5 Saut\xc3\xa9 the spices, then add onions and cook: Heat 2 Tbsp of olive oil in a large frying pan on medium high heat. Add the chipotle powder, chili powder, and cumin.\nOnce the spices are sizzling, add the chopped white onion and cook until translucent.\nAdd the garlic and cook a minute more.\n6 Add beans, then mash: Add the cooked black beans (and liquid from the pot) to the frying pan. Use a potato masher to mash the beans in the pan.  Let them cook 3 to 4 minutes longer.\nIf the beans are a little soupy for your taste, just let them cook longer. If too thick or dry, add more water. Adjust seasonings to taste.\n7 Serve: Garnish with chopped green onions, fresh cilantro, and crumbled cotija or queso fresco cheese.\nServe with tortilla chips or corn or flour tortillas (corn if you are gluten-free).

You can pour this sauce back over the chicken or pour it over rice or pasta.\nThe recipe calls for bone-in thighs. If you make it with boneless thighs you may need to reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.\nThe recipe calls for skin-on thighs. If you make it with skinless thighs, try to cover the thighs as much as you can with the tomatoes, to help prevent the meat from drying out. If you make it with skinless breasts, do the same, and reduce the cooking time to 25 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds (900 g) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n2 cups of cherry tomatoes (a heaping basket or 25 to 30 cherry tomatoes)\n6 whole cloves garlic, peeled\n1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\n1 1/2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil\n2 sprigs fresh rosemary (or 1/2 teaspoon dry rosemary)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Arrange chicken thighs in casserole dish, sprinkle with salt: Place chicken thighs in a baking dish that allows for a little room between the thighs.

The red ones especially are much sweeter. Any bell pepper can be used for this recipe; use the type you like the best.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 1/2 to 2 cups cooked white rice (starting from about 3/4 to 1 cup raw white rice)\n4 to 6 bell peppers (red, yellow, or green), use 4 large, or 6 medium sized\n1 to 1 1/4 pound of ground beef (ground chuck, 16% fat)\n6 large fresh basil leaves, chopped (or 1 1/2 teaspoons dried basil)\n1/2 teaspoon dry summer savory or thyme\n1/2 teaspoon ground marjoram (or 2 teaspoons of fresh chopped)\n(Can substitute herbs with other herbs such as an Italian herb mix)\n1 teaspoon salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\nPaprika\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the rice: If you haven't already made the rice, start cooking the rice following the package instructions (usually 1 cup of raw white rice plus 1 1/2 cups of water and 1/2 teaspoon of salt, bring to boil, reduce heat to low, cover and cook for 15 minutes.)\n2 Steam the bell peppers: Cut the tops off of the bell peppers. Remove and discard (compost) the stem and seeds.\nPlace bell peppers cut side up on a steaming rack over an inch of water in a large covered pot. Bring to boil, let steam for 10 minutes. (Note you can skip this step if you want, but steaming the pepper shells first will make them more tender and easier to eat.)\n3 Mix the filling: Heat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.

If you see this happening, just reheat the butter.\n5 Place chicken on roasting dish: Place coated chicken pieces on to a 9x13 (or larger) roasting dish. Try to leave a little room between each piece. (You may need to use more than one roasting pan.) Drizzle with remaining garlic butter.\n6 Bake: Bake uncovered at 450\xc2\xb0F 15 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.

b'Print\nTuna and Tomato Pasta Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Serves 6-8\nTuna packed in olive oil is highly recommended for this recipe. If all you have is tuna packed in water, you can try draining it and then adding olive oil to the can, and letting it soak in the olive oil in the fridge for several hours, but you will get the best results if you start with tuna packed in oil.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter\n1 28-ounce can of tomatoes, whole or crushed\nSalt\n1 pound pasta shells\n1/2 cup ricotta cheese\n1 6-ounce can tuna packed in olive oil\n1/4 cup fresh basil, chopped or torn\nA generous 1/2 cup grated parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Simmer tomatoes with butter 30 min: Melt the butter in a medium pot on medium heat and add the can of tomatoes, including the juice. If you are using whole canned tomatoes (or fresh ones) crush them with your (clean) fingers as you put them in the pot. Simmer gently, partially covered, for 30 minutes.\n2 Cook pasta: While the sauce is cooking, heat a large pot of well salted water to a strong boil. Add the shell pasta to the boiling water and cook at a vigorous boil, uncovered, until al dente, cooked through but still a bit firm to the bite, which is usually whatever the time specified on the pasta package minus about 2 minutes. Drain and set aside.\n3 Combine tuna, tomato sauce, ricotta, pasta, basil: Pour off the excess oil from the tuna can and stir the tuna into the tomato sauce. Add the ricotta cheese, and add salt to taste. Turn off the heat. Mix the sauce with the pasta in a large bowl. Mix in the basil.\n4 Put into casserole, top with parmesan, broil: Pour the pasta into a 2 to 3-quart casserole dish and top with the parmesan cheese. Put under a hot broiler for 4-6 minutes, until the cheese is melted and lightly browned. Serve hot.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Pour 1 tablespoon of the olive oil into an 9x13 baking dish and use your hand, or a brush, to grease the bottom and sides of the dish. This oil will help create a crisp crust on the bottom of the baked potatoes.\n2 Prep and start baking the potatoes: Thinly slice the potatoes to about 1/8-inch thick; use a mandoline if needed. Try to keep the potato slices together as you cut as this makes it easier to assemble them in the dish.\nFan the potatoes slightly in the dish, overlapping them like a fallen set of dominoes in the pan and creating four rows of potatoes. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt and an 1/8 teaspoon of the black pepper.\nBake the potatoes for 30 minutes.\n3 Make the vinaigrette: Combine the vinegar, 2 tablespoons olive oil, both mustards, rosemary, garlic, and the remaining salt and pepper in a glass jar with a tight-fitting lid (or in a bowl).\nShake the ingredients together vigorously until combined. If you\xe2\x80\x99re making the dressing in a bowl, use a whisk or an immersion blender to combine. Set this aside.\n4 Add the peppers, onions, and sausage to the dish: Carefully remove the dish of potatoes from the oven and evenly arrange the peppers, then the onions, and lastly, the sausage, on top of the potatoes.\nGive the dressing another vigorous shake and pour evenly over the top of the casserole.\n5 Bake the dish: Return the dish to the oven and bake for an additional 30 minutes, or until a knife inserted into the middle of a potato offers no resistance.\n6 Cool and serve: Remove the dish from the oven and cool for 5 minutes before serving.

b"Save It Print\nSmothered Turkey Wings Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 2 hours, 40 minutesYield: Serves 6\nYou'll need the turkey wing tips to make turkey stock for the gravy. If your turkey wings didn't come with the tips, use an extra turkey wing (drumette and flat) for making the stock.\nINGREDIENTS\nTurkey Wings:\n6 whole turkey wings (about 5 pounds), or 7 turkey wings without the tips\n1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil\nSalt\nStock:\n2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n1 carrot, chopped\n1 half onion, chopped\n1 celery rib, chopped\n3 cups water\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nGravy:\n3 Tbsp butter\n3 Tbsp flour\n3 cups of turkey stock (that you make in step...)\n1/2 teaspoon yellow mustard\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon pepper\n1/2 teaspoon dried thyme\n1/4 cup cream\n  METHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the turkey wings: Use poultry sheers or a sharp knife to separate each turkey wing into 3 segments\xe2\x80\x94drumette, flat, and tip. Set aside the tips for making stock.\n2 Slow roast the turkey wings: Place turkey wing drumettes and flats, skin side up, onto a rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan. Toss with olive oil. Sprinkle with salt.\nCover with aluminum foil and put into a 275\xc2\xb0F oven for 2 1/2 hours.\n3 Make the stock: While the turkey wing drumettes and flats are roasting, make stock with the tips. Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a medium, thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat. Add the turkey wing tips and let them brown on all sides.\nAdd the chopped carrot, onion, and celery, and saut\xc3\xa9 them for a few minutes with the wings.\nAdd 3 cups of water, enough to cover the wings and vegetables, and salt. Bring to a boil on high heat, then reduce to a low simmer on the lowest setting. Cover and let simmer while the wings roast in the oven, a couple of hours.\n4 Strain the stock: When the wings are close to being done, strain the stock so you can start making the gravy. Remove and discard the largest solids from the pot. Then strain the rest of the stock through a fine mesh strainer. Reserve the stock for the next step.\n5 Make the gravy: Make a roux by melting 3 Tbsp butter in a medium sized, thick-bottomed pot, on medium heat. Add the flour and whisk to combine. Let the roux cook and bubble for a minute or so.\nSlowly whisk in the turkey stock you made in steps 3 and 4, whisking constantly to break up any lumps.\nWhisk in the mustard, salt, pepper, and thyme. Whisk in the cream. Let simmer on low heat to thicken.\n6 Broil the wings to brown them: After 2 1/2 hours of slow cooking in the oven, the turkey wings should be fall apart tender (if not, you can leave them in longer until they are).\nRemove the foil and place the wings on a rack a few inches under the broiler. Broil for 5 minutes or so, until the wing skin gets somewhat browned.\n7 Scrape the wing roasting pan drippings into the gravy: You don't have to do this, but it will add even more flavor to your gravy. If the drippings are really stuck to the pan, place the roasting pan on your stovetop and turn on the burners under the pan.\nAdd a cup of water to the pan and use a metal spatula to scrape up the drippings. Pour them off into the pot with the gravy.\nTo serve, pour the gravy over the wings. Serve with a side of mashed potatoes, root vegetables, or cauliflower.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nRed Beans and Rice Recipe\nYield: Serves 8\nIf you have access to ham hocks and not shanks, you may want to make up the difference in meat (hocks have much less meat) with sausage. Just take 1/2 pound of Andouille sausage, slice, brown first before adding to the beans with the ham shanks.\nIf you do not eat pork, you might try making this with smoked turkey sausage, in which case I would replace some of the water with chicken stock.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 lb dry small red beans\n1 1/2 to 2 lbs meaty ham shanks\n4 cups water\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n1 large onion, chopped (about 2 cups)\n1 1/2 cups chopped celery\n1 cup chopped green bell pepper\n1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce\n2 teaspoons of Cajun or Creole seasoning (Tony Chachere's or Zatarains) or to taste*\nTabasco sauce**\nSalt and pepper to taste\nCooked white rice (from about 3 cups raw rice)\n*If you don't have access to packaged seasoning, just skip it and add some thyme (fresh or dried), a bay leaf (in with the beans and shanks in step 2), and a little paprika\n**We used a combo of Chipotle Tabasco sauce and regular Tabasco, could also use cayenne pepper\nMETHOD\n1 Soak the beans: Place dried beans in a large bowl and cover them with cold water by a couple of inches.

b'Save It Print\nRotisserie Chicken Stroganoff Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nINGREDIENTS\n12 ounces egg noodles\n4 tablespoons butter, divided\n1 cup diced onion\n8 ounces cremini mushrooms, sliced\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n1/2 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste\nBlack pepper, to taste\n1 1/2 cups chicken stock\n1/2 cup sour cream\n2 heaping cups shredded rotisserie chicken (about 1 pound of meat)\nFresh parsley, garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the noodles: Cook the egg noodles in salted water according to the package directions. Once the noodles are cooked, drain and return them to the pot with two tablespoons of butter, and toss to coat.\n2 Meanwhile, cook the onions and mushrooms: Melt the remaining two tablespoons butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onions and mushrooms and cook for 6 to 8 minutes until the vegetables have softened and are browned in spots.\nAdd the garlic and cook for a final 30 seconds, until the garlic is fragrant. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper.\n3 Make the sauce: Add the flour to the skillet and use a spatula to work the flour into the vegetables, forming a paste-like coating on the vegetables. Cook for a minute and then add the Worcestershire sauce, salt, and some freshly ground black pepper.\nSlowly add the chicken stock in 1/2-cup increments, stirring constantly to prevent lumps.\n4 Reduce the sauce and add the chicken and sour cream: Once your chicken stock has been added, let the sauce thicken for a few minutes and then stir in the shredded chicken. Remove the pot from the heat and add the sour cream, and stir to combine. Taste the sauce and season it with salt and pepper to your liking.\nReturn the pan to low heat and warm until the sauce is once again piping hot. (If you aren\xe2\x80\x99t serving the sauce immediately, you can keep the sauce warm on very low heat for a little while. Be careful as it will curdle over higher heat.)\nIf at any point the sauce gets too thick, thin it with a drizzle of cooking water from the pasta.\n5 Serve: Serve the stroganoff either by stirring the noodles straight into the sauce to combine everything, or portioning out the noodles onto individual plates and spooning the sauce over the top. Garnish with fresh parsley.\nIf you have leftovers, it\xe2\x80\x99s best to store the sauce and noodles separately and then reheat the sauce gently in a skillet with a few spoonfuls of water. You can microwave the noodles with a few spoonfuls of water and then combine everything. The leftovers will keep for a few days without a problem.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nChicken Thighs with Mushrooms and Shallots Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 3 to 4\nBe prepared for a little bit of splattering from browning the chicken. To avoid this you can dredge the chicken pieces first in a little flour. I wanted a gluten-free chicken dish so am not taking that step.\nYou can make this dish with skin-on chicken breasts, they will take less time to cook in the oven than thighs.\nEven if you don't eat the skin, please cook the chicken with the skin on in this recipe. The skin protects the chicken from drying out.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 Tbsp olive oil\n3 pounds skin-on, bone-in thicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 pound cremini or button mushrooms (plus a couple sliced shiitake mushrooms if available for extra mushroom flavor)\n1/2 cup chopped shallots\n3/4 teaspoon dried tarragon (or 2 teaspoons chopped fresh tarragon)\n1/2 cup chicken stock\n1/2 cup dry white wine\n2 Tbsp heavy whipping cream\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Brown the chicken on the stovetop: Heat olive oil in a large wide skillet on medium high heat. Pat dry the chicken pieces and lay them skin-side down in the pan to brown. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Cook without moving the chicken (allowing them to brown) until they are golden brown, about 7-8 minutes.\n3 Bake the chicken in the oven: Place the chicken pieces skin-side up in a roasting pan. Roast in a 350\xc2\xb0F oven for 20 to 30 minutes, or until the internal temperature of the chicken is 165\xc2\xb0F. (Cooking time depends on the size of the chicken thighs, and how long you've cooked them in the skilled first.)\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 mushrooms: While the chicken is roasting, thickly slice the mushrooms. Remove all but 1 Tbsp of the fat in the pan (do not put down the drain or you will clog your pipes). Heat the pan on medium high heat and add the mushrooms to the pan. Stir to coat with the fat in the pan.\n5 Add shallots and tarragon: Cook for a couple of minutes until the mushrooms begin to brown and release some of their water. When the mushrooms are glossy, add the chopped shallots and tarragon and stir. Cook for another minute.\n6 Add stock, wine, then cream: Add the stock and the white wine to the pan and increase the heat to high. Let the liquid reduce by half. Taste and if it needs salt, add 1/4 teaspoon or more of salt. Sprinkle with black pepper.\nStir in the cream. Lower temp to medium. Let simmer for a minute.\n7 Serve: To serve, place the mushroom shallot sauce in the bottom of a serving dish. Place the chicken pieces on top. If there are any drippings in the baking pan, pour them over the chicken. Sprinkle with parsley.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nSkillet Lemon Rosemary Chicken Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 25 minutesMarinating time: 1 hourYield: Serves 3 to 4\nWe are using fresh rosemary. Dried rosemary can get a bit "stick"-like, so I\'m not sure how well it would do as a substitute (if you try it with dry rosemary, please let me know how it works out for you in the comments!). I suggest that if you don\'t have fresh herbs, use half as much of a dry Italian herb mix.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons fresh rosemary, chopped\nZest of one lemon (1 to 2 teaspoons)\n3 cloves of garlic, roughly chopped\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons lemon juice\n  2 to 2 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 6 pieces)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n4 cloves garlic, peeled and crushed\n3 or more shallots, peeled, halved (optional, can use 1/2-inch thick wedges of red onion, or skip)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make rub with the rosemary, zest, garlic, salt, and pepper: Place the rosemary, lemon zest, chopped garlic, salt, and pepper in a mini-chopper and pulse until well ground. (If you don\'t have a mini-chopper, just mince the rosemary and garlic very fine, and mix with the rest). Then add the tablespoon of olive oil and pulse again.\n2 Marinate chicken thighs with rosemary lemon rub: Place the chicken thighs in a (non-reactive) bowl and rub all over with the rosemary lemon herb rub. Arrange the thighs skin-side down and sprinkle with the lemon juice. Let marinate for an hour at room temperature, or chill several hours or overnight, and let sit at room temp for an hour before cooking.\n3 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Sear the chicken thighs: Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a cast iron (10 to 12-inch) or other large relatively stick-free oven-proof skillet (hard anodized aluminum will work well) on medium high to high heat.\nAs soon as the oil is shimmery hot, pat dry the chicken thighs with paper towels and lay them skin-side down in the pan.\nSear the thighs without moving them for 3-5 minutes or until nicely browned.\nTurn the thighs over in the pan so they are skin-side up. Remove the pan from heat.\n5 Arrange garlic and shallots between chicken thighs and roast in oven: Place garlic cloves and either shallots or onion wedges in between the chicken thigh pieces in the pan. Place in the oven and cook for 20 minutes or until the internal temperature of the chicken thighs reach 170\xc2\xb0F.\nRemove from oven.\nAs a safety note (having burned my hand in the past), I recommend rubbing an ice cube on the handle of the hot pan as a way to cook it down quickly. Then be sure you keep the handle covered with a pot holder so that someone (including yourself) doesn\'t inadvertently pick up the pan with the hot handle on their bare hands.\nServe with a side of rice, pasta, bread, or potatoes, or over a bed of baby arugula or spinach leaves for a low carb option.\nHello!

Add the mushrooms and cook for 6 to 8 minutes until they have released their liquid and become tender. Season with salt and pepper (give one a taste!).\n2 Add the flour: Add the flour to the pot and stir it in to coat the mushrooms. The flour will form a paste on the mushrooms and the pan will look quite dry. Cook for a minute and turn heat down to low.\n3 Make the sauce: Slowly add the milk while stirring; the flour will dissolve in the milk. If any lumps of flour form, break them up against the side of the pan with the back of your spoon. Simmer for 1 to 2 minutes until the sauce has thickened slightly, and then add Parmesan cheese.\nLower the heat, cover, and keep warm until ready to serve, up to 10 minutes. If the sauce thickens too much before you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to serve, add a splash of milk to thin it out again.\n4 Make the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water to a rolling boil and cook the pasta until al dente.

If water canned tuna is your only option, drain it, and soak it in half a cup of good quality olive oil for an hour first.\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4 pound (12 ounces) dried fettuccine, spaghetti or linguine\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1/8 teaspoon hot red pepper flakes (more to taste)\n2 6-ounce cans tuna packed in olive oil, drained\nSalt\n5 to 8 ounces baby arugula\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water) to a rolling boil. Add the pasta, return to a rolling boil, and boil uncovered until the pasta is al dente, cooked, but still a little firm to the bite.\n2 Cook garlic and red pepper flakes in olive oil; add tuna, salt: While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a large skillet on medium-low heat. Add the garlic and hot pepper flakes and cook until garlic is fragrant.\nAdd the tuna and shred it into fine flakes with a fork. Season with salt. Keep warm over low heat.\n3 Set aside a cup of pasta water: Just before the pasta is ready, set aside 1 cup of boiling water. You'll need this to add back to the pasta dish to keep it from getting too dry.\n4 Combine pasta with tuna mixture, arugula, and some pasta water: Drain the pasta and depending on the size of your pan, either add it to the skillet with the tuna, or return the pasta to the pasta pot and add the tuna mixture to the pasta.\nAdd the arugula and use tongs to toss together with the pasta and tuna. Add some of the hot reserved pasta water to help loosen the pasta.\nThe arugula will wilt as you toss the pasta and tuna with it. Add more pasta water as needed.\nHello!

Here's how to make beans on the stovetop or in a pressure cooker.\nThis recipe makes a relatively small batch for a stew (serves 4). You can easily double the recipe to make a larger batch.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2 pounds of pork shoulder, trimmed of excess fat, cut into 1 1/2-inch cubes\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 large onion, chopped (about 2 cups)\n4 cloves garlic\n1-2 jalape\xc3\xb1o chili peppers, less or more to taste, seeded, stems removed\n2 tablespoons cornmeal\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n2 teaspoons ground cumin\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n1/2 teaspoon cayenne (less or more to taste)\n1 1/2 tablespoons molasses\n1 red bell pepper, diced, about 3/4 cup\n2 long 1-inch wide strips of orange zest (optional)\n1 cup water\n1 15-ounce can black beans (we recommend Bush's or S&W premium), liquid included\nMore salt to taste\n1 to 2 limes\nCilantro for garnish\nMETHOD\n1 Sprinkle 1 teaspoon salt over the pork pieces and let sit while you prep the other ingredients.\n2 Brown the pork: Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil in a thick-bottomed stew pot on medium high heat. Add the pork pieces to the pot and brown them on all sides.\n3 Add the onions: Once the pork pieces have browned, add the chopped onions to the pot with the pork. Lower the heat to medium and cook until the onions are translucent, about 7-10 minutes more.\n4 Make garlic jalape\xc3\xb1o spice mixture: As the onions are cooking, work on the garlic spice mixture. Place the garlic and the jalape\xc3\xb1os in the bowl of a food processor and pulse until minced. Then add the oregano, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, and cornmeal and pulse everything until ground.\n5 Add spice mixture to pork and onions: Once the onions are cooked, add the spice mixture to the pork and onions.\n6 Add molasses, bell pepper, zest, cover and cook: Add the molasses, bell pepper, orange zest (if using), and water to the pot. Bring it to a simmer and then reduce the heat to the lowest setting. Cover and let cook until the pork is completely tender, about 1 1/2 hours. Stir occasionally and scrape up any browned bits stuck to the bottom of the pot.\n7 Remove zest, add black beans: When pork is tender, remove the orange zest and add the black beans to the pot and cook for 20 minutes more on low heat.\n8 Remove from heat, and stir in the lime juice. Add more salt to taste.\nServe garnished with fresh cilantro. Great with warm corn tortillas.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

You can easily double the recipe. Note the cardamom is optional. I\'ve made these buns with and without a little cardamom and I  prefer them with. I\'m guessing it\'s more traditional without.\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4 cup milk (175 ml)\n1/2 teaspoon saffron threads\n1 teaspoon plus 1/4 cup (50 g) white, granulated sugar\nOne 1/4-ounce packet active dry yeast (check the expiration date on the package to make sure it\'s still good!)\n3 1/2 to 4 cups (490 g to 570 g) all purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\nThe seeds from 3 cardamom pods, ground (optional)\n1/4 cup (1/2 stick, 4 Tbsp, 56 g) unsalted butter, softened\n1/4 cup of sour cream (or quark if available)\n2 large eggs\nRaisins\nGlaze\n1 egg, beaten\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat milk, saffron, sugar: In a small pot, heat the milk, saffron, and 1 teaspoon of sugar together until the milk is steamy. Remove from heat and stir to dissolve the sugar. Let cool until about 115\xc2\xb0F, or warm to the touch, but not hot.\n2 Sprinkle the yeast over the warm saffron-infused milk and let sit for 5 to 10 minutes until foamy.\n3 Whisk flour, sugar, salt, cardamom: In the bowl of a stand-up mixer* whisk together 3 1/2cups (490 g) of the flour, remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, salt and ground cardamom (if using).\n*You can make this recipe without a mixer, for me it\'s just a bit easier with one.\n4 Make a well in the center of the flour and add the yeast milk saffron mixture, the eggs, the butter, and the sour cream. Mix the ingredients until well incorporated.\n5 Knead the dough: Switch to the dough hook of your mixer (if using, otherwise knead by hand). On low speed start to knead the dough. Slowly add additional flour, a tablespoon at a time, kneading to incorporate after each addition. Do this until the dough is still a little sticky to the touch, but does not completely stick to your hands when you handle it.\n6 Let dough rise: Shape the dough into a ball and place in a large bowl. Cover with plastic wrap. (Note at this point you can make ahead and refrigerate overnight if you wish.)\nLet sit in a warm place for 1 to 2 hours, until the dough has doubled in size. (One way to tell that the dough is ready is that you poke your finger in it and it takes quite a bit of time for the indentation left by your finger to go away.)\n7 Form dough into S shapes: When the dough has doubled in size, gently press it down and knead it a couple of times. Break off a piece and form it into a ball about 2 inches wide (60 to 70 grams if you are weighing). Roll the ball out into a snake, about 14 inches long.\nThen Curl the ends in opposite directions, forming an "S" with spirals at each end. Place on a lined baking sheet and repeat with the rest of the dough.\n8 Let sit for second rise:  Cover with plastic wrap and place in a warm spot until the dough shapes double in size, 30 minutes to an hour.\n9 Brush with egg wash, place raisins on buns: Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C). Using a pastry brush, brush some beaten egg over the tops and sides of the uncooked buns. Place raisins in the centers of the "S" spirals.\n10 Bake: Place in the oven and bake at400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C) for about 10 to 11 minutes (turning halfway through cooking to ensure even browning), until the buns are golden brown.\nRemove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before eating.\nHello!

Bake at 325\xc2\xb0F 55-60 minutes, or until cake springs back when touched lightly in the center and pulls away from the sides of the pan. You can also use a bamboo skewer and insert into the thickest part of the cake. If it comes out clean, it's done.\n7 Cool. Remove from oven and cool upright in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Invert cake onto a rack while the cake is still warm. Let cool completely.\n8 Prepare glaze. Once the cake has completely cooled, prepare glaze by whisking together powdered sugar, orange juice, and brandy. (You can sub the brandy with more orange juice or water if you want.)\nMake the glaze thick if you would like a thick, pronounced drizzle, or make it more thin if you want a glaze that is somewhat translucent.\n9 Glaze cake. Place cake on serving platter. Poke a few holes in the top and drizzle with brandy if you want. Use a spoon to stream the glaze onto the cake in back and forth motions to create a striped pattern. Or, if the glaze is thin enough, you can use a pastry brush to brush on the glaze.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Set it to the side to become foamy.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, whisk together the remaining sugar, flour, salt, 3 tablespoons of melted butter. Add the yeast-milk mixture. Mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms, then turn the mixer up to medium-low and knead for 10 minutes (set a timer!). When done, the dough should form a ball and spring back when you poke it.\n2 Let the dough rise for one hour, or overnight: Gather the dough into a ball with your hands and place into a greased bowl. Cover well with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise on the counter for 1 hour, until doubled in size, or place in the fridge to rise overnight. (The dough may not quite double in size if you\'re refrigerating overnight, but it should look risen and puffed.)\n3 Make the apples while the dough rises (or before assembling, if you\'ve chilled the dough overnight): Melt the butter for the apples in a medium skillet. Add the diced apples, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Cook over medium heat for about five minutes until the apples are just tender. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. (The apples can be made up to a day ahead and kept refrigerated.)\n4 Make the caramel sauce: In a large saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/2 cup of the apple cider, and stir over low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Once the sugar has dissolved, stop stirring, increase the heat to medium-low, and bring the mixture to a boil.\nContinue to boil (without stirring!) until the sugar turns a deep golden caramel color, 320F to 330F. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, followed by the salt, cream, and remaining 2 tablespoons of cider. Whisk until smooth. (Caramel sauce can be cooled and refrigerated for several days; warm briefly in the microwave or on the stovetop, until it\'s a "drizzle" consistency, before assembling.)\n5 Assemble the monkey bread: Grease a bundt pan well and set aside. Melt the butter needed for assembly. In a separate bowl, mix together the sugar and cinnamon.\nTear off walnut- or golf ball-sized pieces of dough and roll into balls between your hands, They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be uniform! Dip each dough ball into the melted butter, roll in cinnamon sugar, and place in the bottom of the prepared bundt until there is a good layer on the bottom of the pan (using up about half the dough).\nSpoon all of the apples over the dough, followed by a third of the caramel sauce. Continue rolling the remaining dough and layering in the pan. Drizzle another third of the caramel sauce over the top. (Save the rest of the caramel sauce for serving).\n6 Let the monkey bread rise for 30 to 60 minutes: Cover the monkey bread with plastic wrap. Room temperature dough will take about 30 minutes to rise; dough that\'s cold from the fridge will take 30 to 60 minutes. Let the monkey bread rise until the top looks slightly puffed and pillowy.\n7 Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n8 Bake the monkey bread: Uncover the bundt pan and transfer to a sheet pan (to catch butter drips!). Place in the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. When done, the top should have risen slightly over the top of the pan and the bread should be a deep golden brown.\n9 Cool and serve! Cool the monkey bread in the bundt pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Place a serving plate over the pan, and using oven mitts, flip the pan over to unmold the monkey bread onto the plate.\nDrizzle with the remaining caramel sauce and serve.

My mom made them all the time, one of only two desserts that she was known for, so when I hosted a dessert potluck at a local nonprofit community center with the theme \xe2\x80\x9cLike Mom used to make!\xe2\x80\x9d I knew I had to replicate her Bundt cake. The secret to this recipe is the homemade chocolate syrup, which you make on the stove before adding it to the batter. Made with coffee and cocoa powder (and a touch of honey), it lends a rich, deep chocolate flavor because the cocoa blooms in the hot coffee.

Gently fold in the chocolate chips.\n4 Spoon one-third of the batter into a medium bowl and add the chocolate syrup. Stir to incorporate completely and set aside.\n5 Layer the batter in the bundt: Spoon half of the remaining vanilla batter into the prepared Bundt pan. Scrape the chocolate batter on top. Spread the remaining vanilla batter on top of the chocolate batter.\n6 Swirl the vanilla and chocolate layers: Insert a butter knife or chopstick into the batter and make \xe2\x80\x9cfigure eight\xe2\x80\x9d motions throughout the entire cake to marble the batter. You may want to sometimes dig deep to the bottom and sometimes lift up to make sure the batter really moves around. Just don\xe2\x80\x99t overmix the batters, or else they will blend together instead of marbling.\n7 Bake the bundt cake: Place the pan on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until a toothpick or skewer inserted in the center comes out clean and the cake springs back when pressed down lightly, 50 to 60 minutes.\n8 Let cool in the pan on a wire rack for 20 to 30 minutes and then invert onto a serving plate while still warm. If the cake doesn\xe2\x80\x99t unmold, gently slip a very thin knife between the cake and the pan all the way around to loosen it and then try again.\n9 Make the vanilla bean glaze: Slice the vanilla bean lengthwise, if using, and scrape the seeds into the milk in a large bowl. Chop the bean in half and toss the pod in with the milk as well. Let steep in the refrigerator as the cake cools.\nOnce the cake has cooled completely (after about 2 hours), remove the vanilla bean from the milk and sift 2 cups powdered sugar into the milk. (If using the vanilla extract, add it to the milk right before sifting the powdered sugar; no need to steep it.) The glaze should be thin enough to pour, but thick enough to hold its shape on the cake, similar to honey in consistency. If the glaze is too thin, add more powdered sugar, 1 tablespoon at a time, until it reaches the desired thickness.\n10 Drizzle the glaze on top of the cake, making sure the glaze drips down the sides of the cake. [Emma\'s Tip: Tuck parchment paper under the cake while you drizzle to catch the drips, then remove once the icing is set.] If decorating with chocolate pearls, shavings, or sprinkles, sprinkle them randomly on the cake before the glaze dries.\nHello!

Generously spray a 10-cup capacity bundt pan with baking spray.\n2 Mix the dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, and poppy seeds.\n3 Make the batter: In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the butter until creamy. Add the sugar and lemon zest, beat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until pale and fluffy. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl after each addition.\nWhisk the lemon juice and buttermilk together in a measuring cup. With the mixer on medium-low, beat in a third of the flour mixture, followed by a third of the milk mixture. Continue to add the flour and milk, alternating between the two and scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed.\n  4 Bake the cake: Scrape the batter into the prepared pan and even the top. Tap the pan on the counter a few times to make sure the batter settles into the crevices of the pan.\nBake in the center of the preheated oven for 60 to 75 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean and the top of the cake springs back to the touch.\n5 Cool the cake: Remove the cake from the oven and cool in the pan for 15 minutes before unmolding on a wire rack. The cake should still be warm.\n6 Make the syrup and drizzle over the cake: While the cake is cooling in the pan, make the lemon syrup. Combine the lemon juice and sugar in a saucepan and bring it to a boil over high heat. Boil until the sugar has dissolved, then remove from heat.\nBrush the syrup over the still-warm, unmolded cake. You should use up all the syrup. Cool completely before icing.\n6 Ice the cake: To make the icing, whisk the powdered sugar and lemon juice together, followed by 1 tablespoon of the milk and the salt. Whisk in additional milk as needed until the icing is thin enough to pour, but still holds a ribbon on the surface.\nSpoon the icing over the cooled cake. This cake keeps well, glazed or unglazed, at room temperature wrapped in plastic for 3 days. (If glazed, let the glaze set until dry to the touch before wrapping in plastic.)\n  Hello!

b'Save It Print\nHow to Grill the Best Burgers\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 5 minutesYield: 6 burgers\nThis recipe will make six burgers that are 1/3 pound each. The patties should be 4-inches across and 1-inch thick at the edges before cooking.\nI like hamburgers with a bit of a garlic kick, so if you prefer a subtler garlic flavor, feel free to reduce the amount to your liking or eliminate altogether.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds 80/20 ground beef, cold\n4 cloves minced garlic\n2 tablespoons minced onion\n1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce\n1 3/4 teaspoons freshly ground pepper\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n6 hamburger buns\nButter for buns\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the burger mix: Put the cold ground beef in mixing bowl. Sprinkle the other ingredients evenly over top. Fold the meat over a few times to get everything incorporated. This entire process should only take about 30 to 45 seconds. Don\xe2\x80\x99t over handle the meat.\n  2 Shape the burger patties: Rather than forming the patties in your hand, form them on a tray. This makes it easier to shape the patties without over-handling or warming the meat. I like to use a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper, but any tray or platter will do.\nOn the tray, divide the meat into 6 equal parts (about 5 1/4 ounces each). Gently form each portion into a patty that is 4-inches across with 1-inch sides and a shallow depression in the middle (see photos below). You want the outer 1/2 inch of the patty to be slightly taller than the inside. This keeps the patty from shrinking too much and from puffing up in the center during grilling\nCover the patties with plastic wrap and transfer to the fridge while you heat up your grill and butter your buns.\n  3 Heat the grill: Heat a gas or charcoal grill to 450 to 500\xc2\xb0F, or hot enough that you can only hold your hand above the grill grates for about 1 second.\nButter the insides of all the buns and set them near the grill.\n4 Grill the burgers: Place patties on the grill over direct heat. Cook to your desired doneness:\nFor rare burgers, cook for 4 minutes total (125\xc2\xb0F)\nFor medium-rare burgers, cook for 5 minutes total (135\xc2\xb0F)\nFor medium burgers, cook for 6 to 7 minutes total (145\xc2\xb0F)\nFor well-done burgers, cook for 8 to 9 minutes total (160\xc2\xb0F)\nFlip the burgers at least once during cooking, or as often as you wish. Do not press down on the patties at any time.\n  5 Add the cheese and toast the buns: When you have about 1 minute left on the cooking time, add the cheese to the burgers and the buttered buns to the grill over indirect heat.\n6 Rest the burgers: Remove burgers and buns from grill and transfer to a clean platter. Let the burgers rest for 1 minute before serving.\n7 Serve: Serve with tomato jam, mayonnaise, bacon jam, garlic aioli, blue cheese sauce, saut\xc3\xa9ed mushrooms, Thousand Island, or the classic and always wonderful lettuce, tomato, pickles and red onion.\nHello!

b"Print\nSpicy Turkey and Zucchini Burger Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 4-6\nRecipe adapted from the cookbook Jerusalem by Yotam Ottolenghi and Sami Tamimi.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound ground turkey meat\nJust under 2 cups, lightly packed, coarsely grated zucchini (from about 2 to 3 small zucchinis or one medium zucchini)\n3 green onions, thinly sliced, onion greens included\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh mint (spearmint)\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro (tender stems included)\n1 clove garlic, crushed and minced\n1 teaspoon ground cumin\n1 teaspoon Kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/2 teaspoon cayenne\n3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\nSour cream sauce:\n1/4 cup sour cream\n1/3 cup plain Greek yogurt\n1 teaspoon grated lemon zest\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon minced garlic\n2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil\n1/4 teaspoon salt\nPinch of freshly ground black pepper\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the sour cream sauce by placing all of the sauce ingredients in a bowl and stirring until combined. Chill until ready to use.\n2 Mix the turkey zucchini mixture: In a large bowl place the grated zucchini, sliced green onions, chopped mint, cilantro, and garlic, ground cumin, salt, pepper, and cayenne. Stir to combine.\nWith your hands, mix in the ground turkey until the zucchini mixture is well distributed through the ground turkey.\n3 Form patties: Use your hands to form 3 to 4 inch wide patties, placing them on a baking sheet. Note that the patties will be rather wet, so they may be a little tricky to handle.\n4 Fry gently: Heat 3 Tbsp of olive oil in a large frying pan on medium high heat. Once the oil is hot, lower the heat to medium.\nWorking in batches, place the patties in the pan. Let cook for about 5 minutes, then flip the patties over and cook for another 5 to 6 minutes.\nYou want them to brown and to gently cook all the way through. If the temperature is too high, they'll get browned on the outside but the inside will still be raw. So, cook them gently.\nIf the outsides are browned and the insides still aren't done, lower the heat and cook longer.\n5 Remove to paper-towel lined plate: Once the first batch of patties are done, remove to a paper towel-lined plate while you cook the second batch. Or you can keep the patties warm in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven.\nMakes 8 large patties or up to 18 small ones. Serve with the sour cream sauce.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nHerbed Turkey Burger Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Makes 8 turkey burgers\nGround turkey is typically much leaner than ground beef. In order to keep the burger from being too dry it helps to use ground dark meat from thighs and legs if you can get it. Adding a little olive oil to the mix helps, too.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1/2 medium red onion, minced\n4 minced garlic cloves\n2 pounds ground turkey meat, preferably from the legs and thighs\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n1/2 cup loosely packed chopped parsley\n1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary\n1 tablespoon minced fresh sage\n2 teaspoons chopped fresh thyme\nTo serve:\nBurger buns\nToppings like sliced onions, lettuce, sliced tomatoes, bacon, mayonnaise, mustard, relish, and/or ketchup\nMETHOD\n1 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions and garlic: Saut\xc3\xa9 the chopped onion in olive oil for 3 minutes over medium heat. Add the garlic and saut\xc3\xa9 for another 2 minutes, or until the garlic begins to brown. Remove from heat. Transfer the onions, garlic, and oil to a large bowl to cool down.\n2 Make the burger mix: Once the onions are cool to the touch, add the ground turkey, salt, pepper, and herbs into the bowl. Using your hands, gently mix everything until well combined. You want the herbs mixed in without overworking the meat (which would make the burgers tough).\n3 Form the meat into patties. Use your fingers to form a slight indentation in the middle of the patties. When burgers cook, the meat contracts from the edges. If the middle part is slightly thinner than the edges it will help the patties finish with a more even shape and less of a bulge in the middle.\n4 Cook the burgers: Cook on a hot grill or in a hot cast iron frying pan for 5 to 6 minutes per side, until cooked through (165\xc2\xb0F if using a meat thermometer).\nIf using a grill, first pre-heat the grill on high for 10 minutes and coat the grates with a little vegetable oil.\nIf using a frying pan, put a little oil in the pan first to help keep the burgers from sticking. A trick my mother uses when making burgers in a cast iron frying pan is to sprinkle the bottom of the pan with a little salt. The salt acts sort of like ball bearings, keeping the patties from sticking when you go to flip them.\n5 Serve the burgers: Toast the buns and serve the burgers with the accompaniments of your choice\xe2\x80\x94sliced onions, lettuce, sliced tomatoes, bacon, mayonnaise (especially good with mayo), mustard, relish, and/or ketchup.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nGrilled Beef and Mushroom Burger Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 3-4\nWe call for fresh shiitake mushrooms, but only because they are so much more flavorful than regular button mushrooms. Feel free to use whatever mushroom you want, buttons, cremini, morels, etc. Although this recipe calls for using a grill, you can easily pan fry them on your stovetop. I would recommend using a large cast iron pan for pan frying.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound ground beef\nA 1-ounce package of dried mushrooms (porcini, morels or other mushrooms)\n2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (add more if you like burgers a little saltier)\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/2 pound fresh shiitake mushrooms (can substitute button or cremini), sliced\n1 large onion, sliced thin (about 2 cups)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\nSalt\n4-6 slices of Swiss cheese\nBurger buns\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Process the dried mushrooms in a food processor, or a clean coffee grinder (grind some raw rice to clean out coffee grinds), until ground into a powder. Remove any large mushroom pieces that didn't grind down, a few small pieces will be fine.\n2 Make the burger mixture: In a large bowl, use your clean hands to gently mix together the meat, salt, mushroom powder, black pepper and Worcestershire sauce. Mix just until everything is mostly combined, a minute or two. Do not overwork the meat mixture or it will become tough and meatloaf-like.\n3 Form into patties: Shape the meat into 3-4 patties, using about a quarter to a third of a pound per patty, creating a slight indentation at the centers of the patties (this will help keep the patties fairly flat when they cook, as the sides tend to contract more than the center).\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 the mushrooms, then the onions: Prepare your grill for high, direct heat. While the grill is heating up, heat a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over high heat for 1 minute. Add the mushrooms and dry-saut\xc3\xa9 them until they release their water, about 2-3 minutes.\nAdd the onions and the olive oil, toss to combine and continue to saut\xc3\xa9 over high heat 1 minute. Add salt to taste and cook until the onions soften and begin to brown. Turn off the heat and place in a bowl.\n5 Grill the burgers on high, direct heat to the desired doneness, between 5-8 minutes per side, depending on the thickness of the burgers and how hot your grill is.\n6 Add the cheese: When the burgers are almost done, lay the Swiss cheese over them and allow the cheese to melt.\n7 Grill the buns: Paint the burger buns with a little olive oil and toast them on the griddle or grill grates.\n8 Assemble the burgers: To assemble, put a burger on the bun and top with the saut\xc3\xa9ed onions and mushroom mixture.\nHello!

Your choice.\n3 Clean mushrooms and brush with oil: Wipe the mushrooms clean with a damp paper towel. If you are working with whole mushrooms, slice off the stems (you can use for another purpose, chopped and saut\xc3\xa9ed or for making stock.)\nPaint the tops of the mushroom caps with some of the oil from the sun-dried tomatoes.\n4 Grill onion rounds, mushroom caps, buns: Scrape the grill grates clean. Using a folded up paper towel dipped in olive oil, wipe down the grill grates to oil them.\nBrush the onion rounds with some olive oil and place them on the grill.\nPlace the mushroom caps on the grill, top side down first.

b'Print\nTuna Burgers with Dill Olive Mayo Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 18 minutesYield: 6 burgers\nThese tuna patties taste as good on a bed of lettuce as they do on a toasted hamburger bun.\nFor the spice mix, I use Zatarain\xe2\x80\x99s Creole Seasoning, but you could use Old Bay Seasoning instead.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the dill olive mayo:\n1/3 cup mayonnaise\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh dill or 1 teaspoon dried dill\n1 tablespoon sliced green olives, minced\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon Creole seasoning\nFor the tuna burgers:\n1 large egg\n1/4 cup of mayonnaise\n2 (5-ounce) cans tuna in water, drained\n3/4 cup unseasoned Panko bread crumbs\n2 cloves garlic, minced or microplaned\n1/2 cup corn (frozen or fresh)\n1/2 cup finely grated carrot\n1/4 cup minced red bell pepper\n1/4 cup minced yellow onion\n3/4 teaspoon Creole seasoning\n3 tablespoons olive oil (stove top method) or cooking spray to bake\nFor the topping:\nSliced red onion (optional)\nLettuce (optional)\nHamburger buns\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the dill olive mayo: In a small bowl, combine the mayonnaise, dill, olives, lemon juice, and Creole seasoning. Cover and place in refrigerator until the tuna burgers are ready to be served.\n2 Make the tuna mix: In a small bowl, use a fork to combine the egg and mayonnaise. Add the tuna and stir to combine. In a separate, medium bowl combine panko, garlic, corn, carrot, red pepper, yellow onion, and Creole seasoning.\nAdd the mayonnaise and tuna mixture to the panko mixture. Stir until well combined.\n3 Shape the patties: Use a 1/3 cup measuring cup to measure out a heaping scoop of tuna mixture and form into 6 patties.\n4 Cook the patties in the oven or on the stovetop:\nTo make in the oven: Place a large cast iron skillet in your oven, then preheat the oven to 375\xc2\xb0F. When it reaches the desired temperature, remove skillet from the oven with oven mitts. You want the skillet good and hot, which will help sear the burgers.\nSpray the inside of the skillet and both sides of the tuna burgers with cooking spray; it helps mimic that crisp edge you get when you actually fry something. Add the burgers to the skillet and return it to the oven. Bake for about 7 minutes or until the bottoms of the burgers are golden brown and crispy.\nFlip the burgers and cook until the other side is golden. This should take about 7 to 9 additional minutes.\nTo make this on the stovetop: Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the tuna burgers to the skillet and cook on each side for about 3 to 4 minutes, until the surface is golden brown and crispy. Drain on a paper towel.\nServe on toasted hamburger buns with the dill olive mayonnaise, sliced red onion, and lettuce.\nMake-ahead instructions: Feel free to shape the patties up to 24 hours in advance. Cover with plastic wrap and keep in the fridge until ready to use. Reheat previously cooked patties by heating a teaspoon of oil in a pan over medium heat.

Gradually whisk in the olive oil.\n2 Cook the corn: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the corn and cook for 2 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water.\nTo cut the kernels from the cob, hold one of the cobs upright in the center of a bundt pan (or a mixing bowl with an overturned ramekin in the middle). With a knife, cut the kernels from the cob in a downward motion, letting the kernels collect in the well of the bundt pan.\nRepeat with all the cobs. For more details on this method, read this post.\n3 Toss the corn and arugula: In a medium bowl, toss the arugula and corn with 2 tablespoons of the dressing. (Reserve the remaining dressing for drizzling over the salad.)\n4 Plate the salad: Divide the arugula and corn between 4 salad plates. Gently cut the burrata into four quarters, and transfer to the salad plates.\nTop the salads with the sliced tomatoes, cherry tomatoes, and torn basil leaves. Sprinkle with more dressing and a few grindings of black pepper, and serve with crusty bread.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nFreezer Breakfast Burritos with Sausage, Eggs and Salsa Verde Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 8 large burritos\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound sweet pork sausage\n2 to 3 medium Yukon potatoes, diced (about 3 cups; no need to peel them)\n1 green pepper, diced\n1 medium yellow onion, diced\n8 ounces mild or sharp cheddar cheese, grated\n1 tablespoon butter\n8 large eggs\nSalt and pepper\n1 cup salsa verde, homemade or store-bought\n8 large burrito-sized flour tortillas\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the sausage: In a large skillet over medium heat, cook the pork sausage. Break it up as it cooks until it\xe2\x80\x99s browned evenly. Transfer the cooked pork to a bowl.\n2 Cook the vegetables: Add the potatoes to the skillet used to cook the pork and cook until they are tender and browned in spots, 8 to 10 minutes, stirring regularly. Any fat left over from the pork should be enough to cook the potatoes in, but if the skillet is very dry, add a drizzle of olive oil.\nAdd the diced peppers and onions  and continue to cook until the veggies soften, another few minutes. Season with salt and pepper. Remove the skillet from heat.\n3 Scramble the eggs: In a separate nonstick skillet over low heat, add the butter. Whisk together the eggs in a medium bowl. Once the butter has melted, add eggs and cook until scrambled and set, but not completely dry. Remove from heat and set aside. (You can do this at the same time the vegetables are cooking if you want to multitask!)\n4 Assemble the burritos: Once your fillings are cooled slightly (it\xe2\x80\x99s okay if they are still a bit warm, as long as they're not steaming), lay out a large flour tortilla on a clean surface.\nAdd about 1/8 of the pork sausage, 1/8 of the potato filling, 1/8 of the cheddar cheese, and 1/8 of the eggs. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay to eyeball the amounts, but you should have enough of each filling to make eight burritos. Top with about two tablespoons of salsa verde.\n  5 Roll the burritos: Fold the sides over the filling and then roll the tortilla into a tight burrito. Immediately roll the burrito in foil. Repeat with all burritos.\n6 Freeze the burritos: Transfer the foil-wrapped burritos to a large, freezer-safe, resealable plastic bag and freeze. Burritos will store well in the freezer for up to three months.\nEven if you plan to eat your burritos the same week you make them, we still recommend freezing the burritos until you're ready to eat them. This preserves them better than in the fridge and prevents the burrito from becoming overly soggy.\n7 Reheat the burritos: Unwrap burrito from foil and microwave on high for 4 to 5 minutes, turning once halfway through. At that point the burrito will be hot and you could eat it as is. Serve with extra salsa verde, if desired.\nAs a bonus step, which I love: place the reheated burrito in a small nonstick skillet over medium heat and let the tortilla crisp up for 2 to 3 minutes per side. If you loathe any hint of sogginess in your burritos, this will eliminate the problem!\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Using your hands, massage the marinade into the chicken.\nCover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour, or up to overnight.\n2 Soak cashews and almonds in water for at least an hour to (or up to overnight) before preparing the rest of the recipe.\n3 Cook the chicken: Heat a skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat. Drizzle a teaspoon of oil to the pan.\nWorking in batches, remove chicken from the marinade and grill them on the pan for 3 to 5 minutes on each side, until the chicken is cooked through (clear juice runs out of it when you cut into it). Do not crowd the pan.\nOnce cooked, transfer the chicken into a separate dish. Cover and set aside for later.\n4 Start making the sauce: Melt 1 1/2 tablespoons of the butter in a medium sized Dutch oven or a skillet on medium low heat. As soon as the butter melts, add the ginger garlic paste followed by sugar. Saut\xc3\xa9 for 1 to 2 minutes.\nStir in the tomato and cook for 8 to 10 minutes on medium high heat, until all the extra liquid is cooked off. The sauce should be a loose, paste-like consistency.\nAdd coriander, garam masala, Kashmiri Lal Mirch, and salt. Stir and cook on medium heat for 2 to 3 minutes. Turn off the heat.\n5 Puree the sauce with the nuts: Transfer the paste to a blender or the bowl of a food processor. Add the soaked cashews and almonds. Blend into a smooth paste.\n6 Finish the dish: Return the paste to the cooking pan over medium heat. Add the water to the paste and stir to make a smooth sauce.\nAs the sauce begins to boil, add the grilled chicken and heavy cream. Stir well. Cover the pan and simmer for 5 minutes.\n7 Rest the butter chicken: Turn off the heat and uncover the pan. Stir in the remaining 1/2 tablespoon butter and the kasuri methi. Cover again, and let the dish rest for 8 to 10 minutes so the flavor of kasuri methi can marry into the butter chicken.\n8 Serve: Serve the butter with a side of steamed basmati rice, roti, or naan. Leftovers will keep refrigerated, covered, for five days.\nYou can freeze this dish in an airtight covered container or a zip-top bag for a month. Thaw and reheat in a saucepan over medium-low heat to retain the texture.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Print\nHow to Make Brown Butter\nCook time: 5 minutes\nINGREDIENTS\nUnsalted butter\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Melt the butter: Heat a thick-bottomed skillet on medium heat. Add the butter (if you slice it, it will melt more evenly) whisking frequently. Continue to cook the butter.\n2 Watch for brown specs and nutty aroma: Once melted the butter will foam up a bit, then subside. Watch carefully as lightly browned specks begin to form at the bottom of the pan. Smell the butter; it should have a nutty aroma.\n3 Remove from heat and pour into a bowl to stop the butter from cooking further and perhaps burning.\nIt's pretty easy to overcook browned butter and go from brown to burnt. If the butter starts to blacken, I suggest dumping it and starting over (something I've had to do on occasion), unless you want beurre noir which has a different taste than nutty brown butter.\nIf you want to make sage brown butter sauce, add some fresh sage leaves to the butter once it has melted. Allow the butter to brown and remove from heat.\nUse browned butter immediately or store covered in the refrigerator for future use.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Put on the lid, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the fruit is tender, about 10-15 minutes.\nRemove the apricots from the saucepan with a slotted spoon and place in a food processor. Reserve the cooking water.\nAdd the honey and 1 tablespoon of the cooking water to the food processor, and puree until very smooth, scraping down the sides of the food processor from time to time. If the fruit is too thick for the machine to puree it, add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of cooking water.\nScrape the filling into a container, let it cool, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight or up to 3 days before baking.\n2 Make the dough: Lay a large sheet of plastic wrap on the counter.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Using the large holes of a box grater, grate the margarine or butter into the bowl (work quickly so the butter does not melt). Add the lemon and orange zest.\nWork the grated butter into the flour with a pastry cutter or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add the egg and knead with your hands for a minute or 2, until the dough is smooth and no longer crumbly.\nLay the dough on the plastic wrap, press into a flat rectangle, and wrap tightly. Chill in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 3 days.\n3 Heat the oven and prepare the baking sheets: Preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F and position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it come to temperature for 10 minutes.\n4 Roll out the dough Lightly flour your countertop. Cut the dough in half; return one half to the refrigerator.\nDust both sides of the dough lightly with flour. Roll out to an even 1/8-inch thickness. Use a dry pastry brush or your hands to brush off the excess flour. Using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter or a drinking glass, cut the dough into rounds.\nPlace the rounds on the baking sheets as you go. Once your first sheet is filled, pop it in the fridge so the cookies keep their shape while you work on the second baking sheet. Save and refrigerate the dough scraps.\nRepeat with remaining half of dough, then re-roll scraps and get as many rounds as you can out of them. (You\xe2\x80\x99ll have anywhere between 26 to 36 rounds).\n5 Fill the cookies: Transfer the chilled filling to a piping bag or a zip-top sandwich bag with the corner snipped off.\nWorking with one baking sheet at a time, pipe a circle of filling (about 1-1/2 teaspoons) on the center of each dough round. (You will likely have extra filling. Store it in the refrigerator and use it to spread on toast or stir into yogurt.)\n6 Shape the cookies: Start by folding one edge over. Fold the second edge over so one corner overlaps the other and forms a 60-degree angle. Fold the third edge over, creating the three distinct corners of a triangle. The first few cookies you shape might not be perfect, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll get the hang of it quickly. There is no need to press, pinch or seal the edges.\n7 Bake the cookies: Arrange the cookies so they are about 2 inches apart (they should all fit on two baking sheets). Bake and set your timer for 6 minutes.\nWhen the timer goes off, rotate the sheets front to back and top to bottom. Reset the timer, and bake the cookies for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Total baking time will be 12 to 16 minutes.\n8 Cool the cookies: Cool the cookies on sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer to cooling racks with a metal spatula. You may serve the cookies warm, but they are best at room temperature.\nThe cookies are crispiest on the day you bake them, but they will last up to 3 days in a tightly covered container.\nHello!

To make them pliable again just wrap them in a cloth and heat them in the microwave or in a skillet for 10-20 seconds.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n3/4 teaspoon fine table salt\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter, vegetable shortening, or vegetable oil, at room temperature\n1/2 cup plus 1 tablespoon hot water\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Mix the dough: You can mix the dough by hand or in a stand mixer. I\xe2\x80\x99ve provided instructions for both methods below. Choose the one that works best for you.\nTo mix the dough by hand: In a bowl, stir the flour and salt until blended. Add the shortening, butter, or oil and mix with your fingers until the fat is incorporated in small bits. Add the water and mix with your hands until blended. If the dough seems stiff and dry, add a little more water, 1 tablespoon at a time. On a lightly floured work surface, knead for a few minutes, or until the dough is smooth.\nTo mix the dough with a stand mixer: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, mix the flour and salt on low speed. If using shortening or butter, add it in pieces to the flour and mix on low speed until it is blended. If using oil, stream it into the flour until blended.\nWith the mixer on low speed, slowly stream in the hot water, mixing until it forms a dough. If the dough seems stiff and dry, add a little more water, 1 tablespoon at a time. Turn the mixer to medium-low and mix for about 2 minutes, or until the dough is smooth and supple.\n2 Roughly form the tortillas: Sprinkle a large plate or small baking sheet with flour. On a lightly floured work surface, roll the dough into a cylinder about 6-8 inches long. Cut it into four equal pieces and cut each piece in half, to make eight pieces that are all about the same size.\nRoll the pieces into balls and flatten them into disks. You aren\xe2\x80\x99t rolling them out just yet. Just getting the basic shape in place. They need to rest before the final roll. Place them on the plate, cover with plastic wrap, and allow to rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n3 Roll the tortillas: Lightly flour the work surface and the rolling pin. Start from the center of each disk and roll outward from the center towards the edge and then back towards you. Turn the disk 45 degrees and repeat. Keep rolling back and forth, turning, and flipping the circle of dough over from time to time, until the tortilla is about 7-inches in diameter.\nContinue to roll the tortillas, stacking them between layers of parchment or waxed paper until they are all rolled. Let rest while you heat the pan.\n4 Cook the tortillas: Heat a cast iron pan, griddle, or another skillet over medium heat until hot. Line a plate with a clean dishtowel or napkin.\nPlace one tortilla on the hot pan and cook for about 30 seconds. Air bubbles will appear on the surface and they should have light brown spots on the bottom. Adjust the heat \xe2\x80\x93 you may need to lower it \xe2\x80\x93 so the tortillas cook gently without burning.\nTurn them over and cook for another 20 to 30 seconds on the other side. The tortilla should look puffed up and opaque. If the tortilla needs a little longer, flip for a third time and cook and additional 10 or 12 seconds.\nWhen finished with a tortilla, place it on the dishtowel-lined plate and cover it.\nContinue to cook, stack, and cover the remaining tortillas. (No need to sandwich cooked tortillas between layers of paper.)\n5 Steam the tortillas: If you are eating them right away, wrap them in a cloth napkin and let them steam for 5 to 10 minutes.\nIf you are planning to store them to reheat later, turn a plastic zip-top bag inside out. Place the hot stack of tortillas in the bag, close the bag without sealing it, and let cool.\nWhen cool, remove the tortillas, turn the bag right side out, and slip the stack inside the bag and seal it. The droplets of steam will now be on the outside of the bag and you can pat them dry with a dishtowel.\n6 Store the tortillas: Store the well-sealed bag in the refrigerator for up to four days, or freeze for up to two months.\n7 Reheat the tortillas: Just before serving, heat a skillet or griddle over medium heat. Place each tortilla on the hot pan, and cook for 10 to 12 seconds on each side, or until hot. You can also reheat them in a microwave for 15 to 20 seconds.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nMini Garlic Butter Pretzels Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 30 minutesRise time: 1 hourYield: 16 mini pretzels\nFor a darker color on the pretzels, brush them with an egg wash prior to baking.\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4 cup warm water (100-105\xcb\x9aF)\n1 teaspoon sugar\n2 1/4 teaspoons or one packet (7 grams) of active dry yeast\n2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n6 cups water\n2 tablespoons baking soda\nFor the garlic butter sauce:\n6 tablespoons unsalted butter\n4 cloves garlic, chopped\nCoarse salt\nFresh parsley, garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Activate the yeast: In a small bowl, stir together warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let sit for 5 minutes so yeast can activate. It should be bubbling. (If not, your yeast is old and should be replaced.)\n2 Make the pretzel dough: In a large bowl, stir together flour and salt. Pour in yeast mixture and stir to form a dough. Knead the dough for 6-7 minutes in the bowl until it\xe2\x80\x99s smooth and no longer sticky. If the dough is really sticky, add more flour by the 1/4 cup.\nWhen dough is smooth, transfer to a clean bowl. Cover loosely with a towel or plastic wrap and place in a warm area to rise. Let dough rise for 60 minutes or until the dough at least doubles in size.\n3 Boil a pot of water: Fill a large pot with 6 cups of boiling water and 2 tablespoons baking soda. Bring to a boil. Get out two baking sheets. Line one with parchment paper. Place a wire-rimmed rack on top of the other.\n4 Preheat the oven to 400\xcb\x9aF.\n5 Shape the mini pretzels and boil: After the dough has risen, divide it into quarters and then each quarter into four pieces to make 16 small dough balls. Working with one dough ball at a time, roll the dough out into a thin strand about 12-14 inches long. Form a pretzel by twisting two ends together to form a loop and then folding the ends back up.\nWhen your pretzel is formed, dunk it in the pot of boiling water. Wait until the pretzel floats (maybe 10 seconds) and then remove with a slotted spoon and place on the wire rack over a baking sheet. Let drain. Once all the pretzels have been boiled, move them to the lined baking sheet.\n6 Bake the pretzels: When all the pretzels are shaped, boiled, and placed on the baking sheet, transfer to the oven and bake for 10-12 minutes until they start to brown.\n7 Toss with the garlic butter sauce, then bake for 3-4 more minutes: In a small saucepan, melt butter with garlic over low heat. Once combined, remove from heat to avoid burning butter.\nWhen pretzels come out of the oven, add them to a large bowl and toss with garlic butter mixture. Return to baking sheet, spooning any leftover sauce over each pretzel. Sprinkle pretzels lightly with coarse salt, then return pretzels to oven and bake a second time for 3-4 minutes.\n8 Let cool and serve: Remove pretzels and let cool. Garnish finished pretzels with fresh parsley.\nPretzels are best served slightly warm. Store pretzels in an airtight container on the counter for 1-2 days or in the fridge for up to a week. Reheat in a low 300\xcb\x9aF oven until warmed through, 3-4 minutes.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nEasy Blender Hollandaise Sauce Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesYield: Makes about 1 cup of sauce, good for about 4-6 servings.\nINGREDIENTS\n10 tablespoons unsalted butter (if using salted butter, skip the added salt)\n3 egg yolks (see how to separate eggs)\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/8 teaspoon cayenne (optional)\nMETHOD\n1 Melt the butter: Melt the butter slowly in a small pot. Try not to let it boil\xe2\x80\x94you want the moisture in the butter to remain there and not steam away.\n2 Blend egg yolks, lemon juice, salt, until lightened in color: Add the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt and cayenne (if using) into your blender. Blend the egg yolk mixture at a medium to medium high speed until it lightens in color, about 20-30 seconds.\nThe friction generated by the blender blades will heat the yolks a bit. The blending action will also introduce a little air into them, making your hollandaise a bit lighter.\n3 Lower blender setting, slowly drizzle in melted butter: Once the yolks have lightened in color, turn the blender down to its lowest setting (if you only have one speed on your blender it will still work), and drizzle in the hot melted butter slowly, while the blender is going.\nContinue to blend for another couple seconds after the butter is all incorporated.\n4 Adjust salt and lemon juice to taste: Turn off the blender and taste the sauce. It should be buttery, lemony and just lightly salty. If it is not salty or lemony enough, you can add a little lemon juice or salt to taste.\nIf you want a thinner consistency, add a little warm water. Pulse briefly to incorporate the ingredients one more time.\nStore until needed in a warm spot, e.g. next to the stovetop. Use within an hour or so.\nHello!

Butterfly the chicken by using poultry shears or a knife to cut along one side of the backbone. Cut along the other side and remove the backbone and tail. (See our guide to how to spatchcock or butterfly a chicken.)\nSpread the chicken open, skin side up. Press down on the chicken with the palms of your hands (or pound with your fists) to flatten the chicken. Fold the wings under the chicken.\n2 Make ricotta Parmesan herb mixture: In a medium bowl, mix the ricotta, Parmesan cheese, egg, parsley, garlic, 2 teaspoons of chopped basil, and 1 teaspoon of chopped tarragon.\n3 Stuff ricotta mixture under chicken skin: Using a sharp paring knife and your fingers, loosen skin over top of chicken and drumsticks starting at neck edge. Work with your fingers and hand to press under the chicken skin to separate the chicken skin from the chicken breasts, thighs, and drumsticks. Be gentle, the skin can easily tear.\nCarefully spoon cheese mixture under skin of chicken, pressing with your fingers to distribute evenly over the chicken and drumsticks.\n4 Season chicken: Brush chicken lightly with oil; sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon basil, 1/2 teaspoon tarragon, paprika, and a generous amount of salt.\n5a Cook chicken using an oven: Preheat oven to 500\xc2\xb0F. Place chicken, skin side up, on a rack in a roasting pan. Place in oven and immediately turn the heat down to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n5b OR Cook chicken using a grill: Prepare grill for medium indirect heat. If using a gas grill, heat all burners on high until the grill is hot, then turn off the middle burner.\nIf using a charcoal grill, bank the coals to one side of the grill and place a large aluminum drip pan underneath the grate on the side without coals, adding a couple cups of water to the drip pan so that the drippings don't burn.\nPlace the chicken, skin side up, on the cooking grate, away from the side with coals if you are using a charcoal grill, or above the middle burner if you are using gas.\nAlternatively, you can lay the chicken out on a rack in a disposable aluminum roasting pan and place the roasting pan on the cooking grate (this tip works well with gas grills, I haven't tried it with the charcoal one yet). Cover the grill.\n6 Roast the chicken for an hour or until the juices run clear from the thigh when pierced with a fork. (Chicken should have an internal temperature of 165\xc2\xb0F when tested with a meat thermometer.) If the skin browns before the chicken is cooked through, cover it loosely with foil.\n7 Let rest: Transfer chicken to a cutting board; let stand 10 minutes. Cut into quarters to serve.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHow to Spatchcock (Butterfly) a Chicken\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: 4 or more servings, depending on the size of the bird\nThis method will work with any size bird, even turkeys.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 whole chicken\nSpecial equipment:\nKitchen shears\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Lay the chicken breast side down on a cutting surface. You should be looking down at the chicken's backbone.\n2 Using kitchen shears, cut out the backbone. You can start from the top of the chicken or the bottom. Cut slightly to one side of the backbone, so that you're cutting through rib bones and not the backbone itself.\nIf it feels very difficult to cut through the bones, try repositioning your scissors slightly further away from the backbone.\nCut all the way up one side of the backbone and then all the way up the other. Remove the backbone and set it aside.\n3 Use your hands to open up the bird slightly, then flip it breast side up. Now the breast of the chicken should be facing up. Fold the legs so they are facing inward and the majority of the meat is facing up.\n4 Flatten the chicken: Use the palm of your hand and press down firmly over the breast bone.\nThe aim is to flatten the chicken so the breast meat and the thighs are at roughly the same level. You will likely hear some crunching (though it's ok if you don't). You can also pick up the chicken and use your hands if that feels more comfortable.\n5 Tuck the wings under (optional): The tips of the tiny, thin wings tend to cook quickly and burn during cooking. Tuck them behind the body of the chicken to help slow down their cooking and keep the tips protected.\n5 Roast or grill the chicken. If roasting, place the chicken in a roasting pan, rub it all over with olive oil, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Roast at 450\xc2\xb0F for 35 to 45 minutes, until the chicken registers at least 165\xc2\xb0F in both the thighs and the breast.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Save it for stock, if you like.\nTurn the chicken over so it is lying breast side up on the cutting board. Press firmly on the breastbone to flatten it.\nPat the chicken dry, and sprinkle with salt and pepper on both sides. Place it in a baking dish.\n2 Make the marinade: In a small bowl, stir together the orange zest, orange juice, lemon juice, ginger, olive oil, honey, coriander, paprika and salt. Pour the marinade over the chicken, turning to coat.\nCover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours or up to overnight, turning occasionally in the marinade.\n3 Prepare a gas or charcoal grill: If using a gas grill, set one side to high temperature and the other side to low temperature. Heat the grill to at least 450F.\nIf using a charcoal grill, prepare a two-level fire. Arrange two-thirds of the charcoal on one side of the grill and spread the remaining one-third on the other side.\nWhen your gas or charcoal grill is hot, use tongs to oil the grill grates with a small folded piece of paper towel dipped in oil.\n4 Grill the chicken: Set the chicken on the cool side of the grill with the skin side up and legs facing the hot side. Cover with the lid and cook for 20 minutes.\nRotate the chicken, still skin-side up, so that the breast side is closer to the hot side. Continue to cook for another 10 to 20 minutes, or until an instant read thermometer registers at least 165F when inserted into both the thigh and breast.\n(Exact cooking time will depend on the heat of your grill and the size of the bird, so always double-check the internal temperature.)\n5 Crisp the skin: Once the chicken has cooked through, carefully flip the chicken over onto the hot side of the grill. Cook for an additional 1 to 3 minutes, or until the skin is brown and crisp.\n6 Let the chicken rest: Transfer the chicken to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes.

b"Print\nHow to Make Gluten-Free Biscuits Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 20 minutesChilling time: 30 minutesYield: 10 (2 1/2-inch) biscuits\nYou can also bring this dough together in the food processor (with gentle pulses) and by hand (soak your hands in cold water; the butter should be even colder), but we have found that using the stand mixer works quickly and requires the least amount of manual interference with cold butter. And this is what you want for flaky biscuits!\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups (about 300 g) gluten-free flour mix, preferably Bob\xe2\x80\x99s Red Mill 1-to-1 Gluten-Free Baking Blend or another flour blend with xanthan gum\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon baking soda\n2 tablespoons sugar\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup (8 tablespoons) very cold butter, cut into tablespoons and then cut in half, plus more to grease the pan\n3/4 to 1 cup cup cold buttermilk\n1 tablespoon melted unsalted butter\nSpecial equipment:\n9-inch cast iron skillet, or 8x8 baking dish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Combine dry ingredients: Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda, sugar, and salt in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. \n2 Add the butter: On the low speed, let the mixer break up the butter into smaller pieces; this should take about a minute. Stop the mixer and check; you still want visible pieces of butter about the size of marbles or even a little bigger. They will look like they are starting to flatten.\nThis dough is not a situation where we say the flour and butter should look like \xe2\x80\x9cthe consistency of small peas.\xe2\x80\x9d If some of the pieces haven't flattened, just press them between your fingertips to break them up a little bit\xe2\x80\x94dime-sized pieces are fine.\n3 Add the buttermilk: Remove the bowl from the stand mixer and add 2 tablespoons of buttermilk. Using a fork, quickly mix the buttermilk into the flour to hydrate it.\nThen, slowly mix in a scant 3/4 cup of buttermilk and combine with a fork until no streaks of flour remain. If the dough seems dry, add additional buttermilk a tablespoon at a time and incorporate before adding more. You don't want a wet dough.\n4 Gather the dough into a ball: On a floured surface, turn out the dough, which will look like a crumbly mess. It will come together when you begin to shape it into a ball. If for some reason (ambient humidity, variations in buttermilk thickness) the dough feels dry, add a couple of tablespoons of buttermilk to hydrate those dry bits.\n5 Fold the dough like a letter: Lightly press the dough (or roll it with a floured rolling pin) into a thick rectangular shape, about 4 inches by 6 inches. Fold one of the short ends of the dough toward the middle, and then the other, like a letter.\nRotate the dough 1/4 turn and roll it out, and fold it again into thirds. Repeat this process one more time, then wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 1/2 hour to an hour. (This process creates flaky layers; if you skip it, your biscuits will bake flat, like hockey pucks.) \n6 Prep the oven and pan: Preheat the oven to 425\xc2\xb0F and prep a 9- or 10-inch cast iron pan or an 8x8 glass baking dish with either spray oil or grease with butter.\n7 Roll and cut out the biscuits: Remove the dough from the fridge and, using a rolling pin, gently roll it out to a rectangle about 6 inches by 9 inches and one inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter that\xe2\x80\x99s been lightly floured (this dough can be sticky), cut out about 6 biscuits by pressing the cutter straight down into the dough; if you twist them when you remove them, you\xe2\x80\x99ll stunt their rise!\nReroll the scraps, reflouring the biscuit cutter if needed, and make more biscuits until all the dough is used up.\nTransfer to the pan. You will have to nestle them close to each other, and that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. You want them touching in order for them to rise better. Brush the tops with the melted butter.\n8 Bake: Bake the biscuits for 20 to 25 minutes until the tops look lightly brown around the edges. Check frequently to avoid burning.\n9 Cool and serve: Remove from the oven and brush the tops with melted butter. Let the biscuits cool in the pan for about 5 to 10 minutes before removing from the pan to a wire rack to cool completely. Try to wait the seemingly impossible 10 minutes before you eat one. They will continue to cook a little, firm up a little while cooling, and not burn your mouth. It\xe2\x80\x99s all worth the wait.\nThese biscuits are best eaten warm out of the oven, but they do okay reheated in a toaster or low oven (300\xc2\xb0F) for up to 2 days. They get dried out pretty fast.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"
b"Save It Print\nBiscuits and Gravy Recipe\nCook time: 35 minutesYield: Makes 10 to 12 servings\nI recommend preparing the biscuits first (not baking them), getting the gravy started, and then baking the biscuits while the gravy is thickening up. That way you can stir the gravy frequently which is hard to do when your hands are covered with flour and dough.\nIf you don't have self-rising flour, you can substitute using a ratio of 1 cup all-purpose flour, 1 1/4 teaspoon baking powder, plus 1/8 teaspoon of salt, for every cup of self-rising flour.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the Buttermilk Biscuits:\n2 1/2 cups self-rising flour (plus extra for flouring your surface)\n2 tsp sugar (optional)\n1/2 tsp kosher salt\n4 Tbsp vegetable shortening (see Baking Tips below)\n4 Tbsp butter, cut into cubes, chilled\n1 cup chilled buttermilk, plus 1-2 Tbsp more, if needed\n1 Tbsp melted butter (optional, to brush on top of biscuits after baking)\nFor the Sausage Gravy:\n1 lb sage-flavored pork sausage\n1/4 cup finely chopped white or yellow onion\n6 tbsp all purpose flour\n4 cups whole milk\n1/2 tsp poultry seasoning\n1/4 tsp ground nutmeg\n1/4 tsp salt\n1-2 dashes of Worcestershire sauce\n1-2 dashes of Tabasco sauce, cayenne pepper, or other hot sauce\n1-2 Tbsp butter or bacon grease (if needed)\nMETHOD\nTO MAKE THE BUTTERMILK BISCUITS:\nBaking Tips: 1) Spoon the flour into your measuring cup, and level it off with the back side of a knife. If you scoop the flour, it will pack into the measuring cup, yielding too much flour, 2) Instead of 4 Tbsp each of butter and shortening, feel free to use 8 Tbsp of shortening or butter, or any combination up to 8 Tbsp.\n1 Preheat oven to 450\xc2\xb0F. Prepare a floured surface for shaping the dough and have an un-greased baking sheet ready (lined with Silpat sheets if you have them).\n2 Whisk together flour, sugar and salt in a medium-sized bowl.\n3 Using a fork or a pastry blender cut in the shortening and butter. Work quickly, you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the fats to melt \xe2\x80\x93 the key to fluffy biscuits is minimal handling. The mixture should be crumbly.\n4 Make a well in the flour mixture, and pour in the buttermilk. Stir with a spoon and blend just until the liquid is absorbed and the dough comes away from the sides of the bowl \xe2\x80\x93 add 1-2 tbsp more buttermilk if the dough is dry. Do not over mix; the dough will be tacky, neither wet nor dry.\n5 Fold and shape dough: With lightly floured hands, turn out the dough onto a lightly-floured surface and gently fold it over on itself 2 or 3 times. Shape into a 3/4\xe2\x80\x9d thick round. If you use a rolling pin, be sure to flour it first to keep the dough from sticking to the pin.\n6 Cut out biscuits: Using a 2-inch biscuit cutter, cut out the biscuits pressing straight down (avoid the temptation to twist the cutter as twisting keeps the biscuits from rising). Dip the cutter in flour between cuttings to keep the dough from sticking to the cutter.\nPlace biscuits on the baking sheet so that they just touch (for crunchy sides, leave space in between). Reshape scrap dough and continue cutting. Remember to handle the dough as little as possible.\n(At this point you can start on making the sausage gravy below, and put the biscuits in the oven right before adding the milk in the last gravy step.)\n7 Bake: Bake at 450\xc2\xb0F for 15-18 minutes or until lightly golden brown on top. Turn the baking sheet around halfway through baking.\n8 Brush with butter: (Optional) Brush the tops of the biscuits with melted butter.\nTO MAKE THE SAUSAGE GRAVY:\n1 Brown the sausage, stir in onions: Preheat a 4-quart saucepan over medium high heat (put a few drops of water in the pan \xe2\x80\x93 when they evaporate, you know the pan is ready). Crumble the sausage into the pan and let it brown for a minute or two, then turn down to medium heat.\nContinue cooking, breaking up the sausage into smaller pieces, until no pink remains. Stir in the onions and cook until they are transparent.\n2 Adjust fat, add flour, brown the flour: Remove sausage with a slotted spatula or spoon, leaving the drippings in the pan. If less than 3 tbsp of drippings remain, add enough butter (or bacon grease) to equal about 3 tbsp of drippings.\nAdd the cooked sausage back to the pan on medium heat, and sprinkle the flour over the sausage.\nStir in the flour and cook for about 6-8 minutes, until the mixture starts bubbling and turns slightly golden brown.\n3 Add seasonings: Stir in poultry seasoning, nutmeg, Worcestershire sauce, Tabasco sauce and salt \xe2\x80\x93 cook for 1 minute to deepen the flavors.\n4 Add the milk, and cook until thickened: Slowly add the milk and cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thickened (about 15 minutes). Be patient, it will thicken!\nTO SERVE THE BISCUITS AND GRAVY:\nTo serve, break a biscuit in half and put it in a bowl or on a plate. Spoon a generous portion of sausage gravy over the biscuit half and top with the other biscuit half.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nClassic Buttermilk Waffles Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 6 Belgian-sized waffles, or 12 regular waffles\nFor extra-crispy waffles, replace half of the buttermilk with whole milk and reduce the baking soda to 1/2 teaspoon.\nLet your waffle iron fully heat before using or your waffles might not cook evenly.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups (280g) all-purpose flour\n2 tablespoons sugar\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 cups buttermilk, well-shaken\n1/4 cup (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted\n2 large eggs\n1/4 cup melted butter for the waffle iron, optional\nSpecial equipment:\nWaffle iron\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Warm the oven to 250F. Set a wire metal cooling rack on top of a baking sheet and place in the oven. (You can also toast waffles directly on the oven rack, if you prefer.)\n2 Whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.\n3 Whisk together the buttermilk and butter. Whisk in the eggs.\n4 Stir the buttermilk mixture into the flour. Continue gently stirring just until you see no more streaks of dry flour.\n5 Rest the batter while your waffle iron warms: Cover the batter with a clean kitchen towel and let it rest for at least five minutes while you warm the waffle iron. The waffle iron is ready when a drop of water sizzles on contact with the griddle.\n6 Make the waffles: Brush the waffle iron with melted butter, if you like. This helps give your waffles a golden color and prevents sticking, but isn't crucial for the recipe. Scoop 1/3 to 1/2 cup of batter into each grid of the waffle iron and cook until golden, according to your waffle iron's instructions.\n7 Transfer the cooked waffles to the oven: When the waffles are done, transfer them to the cooling rack on the baking sheet in the oven. Place them in one single layer so that they crisp evenly on top and bottom, and so steam isn't trapped between layers. Let them toast for 5 to 10 minutes.\n8 Cook the remaining waffles: Transfer each batch of waffles to the oven as they are ready. Waffles that have been toasting for a few minutes can now be stacked to make room for the following batches.\n9 Serve the waffles: Serve the waffles as soon as all batches are made and crisped. Let leftover waffles cool completely, then store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to a week, or freeze for up to 3 months. Reheat briefly in the toaster until warmed and crisped.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"

b"Print\nHow to Peel and Cut a Butternut Squash\nPrep time: 10 minutes\nKeep squash pieces as stable as possible while cutting. A rubber mallet can help, if you have one, to gently push the knife through difficult thick spots. Using a very sharp vegetable peeler, one with a carbon steel blade, will help with the peeling.\nBy the way, it helps to microwave a butternut squash (whole) for 30 seconds or so first, before peeling. This will help soften the peel just enough to make it a bit easier to peel.\nINGREDIENTS\nOne butternut squash, 1 1/2 to 3 pounds\nA sharp, heavy, chef's knife\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Slice off the ends: Using a heavy, sharpened chef's knife, cut off about 1/4-inch from the bottom of the squash in an even slice. Then cut off 1/4-inch from the stem end.\n2 Peel with a vegetable peeler: Holding the squash in one hand, use a sharp vegetable peeler in the other hand to peel off the outer layer of the squash. You can also secure the squash standing upright and peel it in downward strokes with the peeler.\n3 Cut the squash in half: Stand the peeled squash upright on a cutting board. It shouldn't wobble, you want the squash to be stable. (If it is wobbly, make another cut at the bottom to even it out.) Make one long cut, down the middle from the top to bottom, with a heavy chef's knife.\nSome squashes can be pretty hard; to help with the cutting you can use a rubber mallet to gently tap on the ends of the knife to help push the knife down through the squash.\n4 Scrape out the seeds: Use a metal spoon to scrape out the seeds and the stringy pulp from the squash cavity. (If you want, you can prepare the seeds like toasted pumpkin seeds.)\n5 Cut squash halves into slices: Lay the squash halves, cut side down on the cutting board for stability. Working section at a time, cut the squash into slices, lengthwise, the desired width of your squash pieces. Some recipes call for 1/2-inch slices or cubes, some for 1-inch or greater.\n6 Stack and slice, then make crosswise cuts into cubes: If you are cubing the squash, lay the slices down (you can stack a few at a time) and make another set of lengthwise cuts. Then make crosswise cuts to make cubes.\nOne 1 1/2 pound butternut squash will yield approximately 4 cups of 1/2-inch cubed squash.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Add half of the cubed butternut squash. Toss to coat with the oil. Let cook until lightly browned on several sides.\nRemove with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Repeat with the remaining butternut squash. Remove to a bowl.\n2 Cook the onions and spices: Add 1 tablespoon of olive oil to the pot. Add the chopped onion. Lower the heat to medium and cook for a few minutes to soften.\nThen add the curry powder, ground ginger, and nutmeg. Cook for a few minutes more.\n3 Add the chopped pear, and toss to coat.

b"Save It Print\nButternut Squash with Brown Butter and Thyme Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 35 minutesYield: Serves 3 to 4\nINGREDIENTS\n1 1/2 pounds butternut squash, peeled, seeds removed, flesh diced into 1/2-inch pieces (about 4 cups)\n3 tablespoons butter\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme (or 1 teaspoon of dried)\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the butter: Heat a large skillet on medium heat. Add the butter, whisking frequently. Once melted the butter will foam up a bit, then subside. Honey-colored browned milk solids will begin to form. The butter should have a wonderful nutty aroma.\nRemove from heat. Add the thyme, whisking continuously. If using fresh thyme, the mixture will foam up a bit.\n(Note that it doesn't take much time to go from browned butter to burnt butter. You will want to remove the pan from the heat element and place it on a cool surface to help stop the cooking of the butter. If the butter burns, I recommend dumping it and starting over, something I've had to do on occasion when not paying close attention.)\n2 Brown the cubed squash in the butter: Add the cubed butternut squash pieces to the pan and return the pan to the burner, heating to medium high.\nUse a wooden or metal spoon to stir the squash pieces so they are all well coated with the butter thyme mixture.\nSprinkle generously with salt and pepper.\nSpread the squash pieces out in an even layer and let cook, without stirring, so that they brown a bit on one side (several minutes). Stir and spread the pieces out again and let cook without stirring so more sides get browned.\n3 Lower the heat, cover and cook: Reduce the heat to low, cover the pan, and let cook until the squash is tender, 10 to 20 minutes, depending on how big you cut the pieces.\nAdd more salt and pepper to taste, sprinkle with a bit more chopped fresh thyme before serving.\nHello!

Add a dab of butter to the olive oil.\nWorking in two batches so as not to crowd the pan, add the cubed butternut squash to the pan. Toss to coat all sides with oil. Sprinkle a little salt over the squash. Then spread out in an even layer and let cook, stirring only occasionally, so that the edges and sides get lightly browned.\nYou may need to adjust the heat up to ensure browning, or down to prevent burning or drying out. Add more oil and butter for the additional batches. Remove from pan and set aside.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions, spices, ginger: Heat another tablespoon of olive oil in the pot, on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook, stirring now and then, until softened. Add the curry powder, mustard seeds, cumin, and fresh ginger, and cook for a minute or so longer. Use a flat bottomed wooden or metal spatula to scrape up any browned bits.\n3 Add the squash, stock, salt, then simmer: Return the butternut squash to the pot. Add the chicken stock and a teaspoon of salt. Increase the heat to bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer, cover the pot. Cook for 40 minutes until squash is completely tender.\n4 Pur\xc3\xa9e the soup: Use an immersion blender (or a stand up blender in which case work in batches) to blend the soup smooth.

As a guideline, roast the radicchio for about 25 minutes, turning halfway.\nRoast the onions about 35 minutes, again, turning halfway. Roast the squash pieces for 45 minutes, but do not turn.\nIn all cases do not remove from the oven until you see browning on the edges.\n2 Toast the pine nuts: While the vegetables are roasting, toast the pine nuts.  Heat a small pan on medium high heat.  Add the pine nuts in a single layer. Cook until lightly toasted. Remove from heat to a bowl to keep the nuts from burning.\n3 Chop roasted radicchio and onions: Once all the vegetables are cool enough to handle, roughly chop the radicchio and onion into manageable pieces.\n4 Toss with pine nuts, parsley, balsamic, black pepper: Place the radicchio, onion, and butternut squash in a large serving bowl. Add the pine nuts and parsley. Add black pepper to taste. Drizzle with balsamic vinegar. Stir gently to combine, taking care not to squish the soft roasted squash.\nTo serve, sprinkle with some grated Parmesan or pecorino cheese.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nPasta with Butternut Squash Parmesan Sauce Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4-6\nThis butternut pasta sauce will work with any pasta, but spaghetti is an especially good pairing.\nBe careful when you cut the squash, winter squash are hard! The best way to do it safely is to slice a bit off of both ends so that you can stand the squash upright without it rolling. Then cut down the middle. See how to cut and peel a butternut squash for visuals, though note for this recipe you do not want to peel the squash before roasting.\nIt also helps if you have a microwave, to microwave the whole squash for a minute before cutting into it. This will lightly soften the outside of the squash, making it easier to cut it.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 butternut squash weighing about 2 1/2 pounds\n1 pound pasta\n1 tablespoon of extra virgin olive oil\n1/3 cup of chopped shallots or onions\n1/4 cup of packed, freshly grated Parmesan cheese\n1/3 cup sour cream or Greek yogurt\n1/8 teaspoon of grated nutmeg\n1 tablespoon of chopped parsley, for garnish\n1 teaspoon salt (more to taste)\nPepper to taste\nWater as needed to thin the sauce, about 1 cup\nMETHOD\n1 Bake the butternut squash: Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Cut the butternut squash lengthwise in half and scoop out the guts and seeds and discard them (or save the seeds and toast them).\nPour 1/4 cup of water into a baking dish and place the butternut squash halves cut side down.\nBake for 40 minutes or until a fork easily pierces the squash. Allow to cool for 10 minutes.\nScoop out the squash flesh from the skins and put into a blender. Discard the skins.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 the shallots in the olive oil over medium heat in a small skillet until just beginning to brown, about 2-3 minutes.\n3 Pur\xc3\xa9e in blender: Add the shallots to the blender. Add 1 cup water, the parmesan, 1 teaspoons salt and 1/8 teaspoon nutmeg and blend until smooth. Taste and add more salt if needed. If the sauce is too thick, thin it with a little more water.\n4 Add sour cream and heat until warm: Pour the sauce into a small pot set over low heat. Mix in the sour cream and warm it through. Do not let the sauce boil.\n5 Cook pasta in boiling salted water: Fill a pot with water and salt (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water). Set over high heat to bring to a hard boil. Add the pasta and cook at a hard boil, uncovered until al dente.\n6 Mix cooked pasta with sauce: When the pasta is ready, drain and put it into a bowl. Mix with a little of the sauce and serve. Add a dollop of additional sauce and some parsley right when you bring it to the table.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Lightly brush two baking sheets with about 1 tablespoon of olive oil.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together miso, maple syrup, the rest of the oil, salt, and pepper. Add butternut squash cubes, and toss to coat.\nSpread squash out onto baking sheets with plenty of room between pieces. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown and crispy at the edges. For more caramelization, turn the squash at the 15-minute mark.\n2 Make the dressing: Mix together all ingredients in a small jar and shake well to emulsify.\n3 Assemble the salad: Toss the roasted squash (hot, warm, or cool), the dressing, and the remaining salad ingredients together in a large salad bowl.

b"Save It Print\nPasta with Butternut Squash, Bacon, and Brown Butter Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound butternut squash, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 4 cups)\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1 teaspoon Morton\xe2\x80\x99s kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper\n1 pound pasta, such as penne, rigatoni, or other short-shaped pasta\n8 ounces bacon (7 to 8 slices, depending on how thickly they are cut)\n1/4 cup sliced shallots\n1 stick unsalted butter (4 ounces/8 tablespoons)\n4 to 5 sage leaves\n1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Roast the squash: Preheat the oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. On a rimmed baking sheet, combine the squash with olive oil, salt, and pepper on a rimmed baking sheet, and toss to coat.\nRoast for 20 minutes, tossing half way through to evenly brown. When it\xe2\x80\x99s ready, the squash will be soft and some of the edges will have browned.\n2 Cook the pasta: Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook the pasta to al dente, or according to package directions. Drain well and set aside.\n3 Fry the bacon: In a large, deep skillet (I used cast iron), put the bacon in a cold pan and cook over medium heat until crispy. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.\n4 Cook the shallots: Place the skillet back on the stove, but with the heat turned off. Drain all but about 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease.\nAdd the shallots and cook in the residual heat from the skillet; this helps prevent the shallots from burning. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be cooking fast enough, turn the heat to medium-low and cook for just a couple of minutes until they start to soften and become aromatic. Transfer the cooked shallots to a large bowl.\n  5 Combine the bacon, shallots, squash and pasta: After the bacon cools, cut it into small pieces using kitchen scissors (or using a chef's knife), and combine with the shallots in a large bowl\xe2\x80\x94or you can use the stockpot you cooked the pasta in (I like to do this if it's just me and the boys).\nAdd the pasta and toss to combine. When the squash comes out of the oven, add the squash to this bowl and toss gently together.\n  6 Brown the butter: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir it constantly and keep an eye on it so it does not burn. (See here for full instructions on how to brown butter.) It will start to crackle, foam, and smell nutty. The color will deepen to a caramel/amber hue.\nAround when the butter stops foaming\xe2\x80\x94or at least it starts to subside\xe2\x80\x94and the butter turns slightly brown, add the sage leaves.\nRemove the saucepan from the heat as soon as the sage leaves start to curl. Pour the butter and the sage leaves into the bowl with the rest of the ingredients.\n  7 Combine all ingredients and serve: Toss everything gently together with a wooden spoon. Taste and add salt and/or pepper if needed. Serve immediately with freshly grated cheese over the top.\nIf you are feeling extra decadent, add a chunk of unsalted butter or a splash of extra virgin olive oil on top when you toss, or some of the reserved bacon grease.\nLeftovers keep for about 2 to 3 days and reheat fairly well. I like to add a bit of olive oil or water to the pot when I reheat it over low heat. (I try to avoid microwaving leftover pasta because it just makes it gummy.)\nHello!

The salt is totally non-traditional, though, so omit if you want that nostalgic, ultra-sweet Magic Bar experience.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 cups (225 g) graham cracker crumbs\n1/2 cup (115 g / 1 stick) melted unsalted butter\n14 ounces (396 g / 1 can) sweetened condensed milk\n1 cup (185 g) semi-sweet chocolate chips\n1 cup (185 g) butterscotch chips\n1 cup (115 g) chopped pecans\n1 cup (105 g) shredded sweetened coconut\n1 teaspoon flaky sea salt (like Maldon), optional\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 350F. Spray a 9 x 13-inch baking pan with cooking oil then line it with parchment paper.\n2 Make the graham cracker crust: Place the graham cracker crumbs and the melted butter in a bowl. Toss with a fork until the crumbs are moist and hold together when squeezed with your hand.\nDump the crumbs in the middle of the pan and then press them into an even layer with your fingers or the back of a flat-bottomed cup.\n3 Pour the sweetened condensed milk over the graham cracker crust. Spread to edges of the pan with a spatula.\n4 Layer on the rest of the toppings: In this order, sprinkle the chocolate chips, butterscotch chips, pecans, and then sweetened coconut over the top of the condensed milk.\nGently press the ingredients down with your palm so they stick to the condensed milk.\n5 Bake in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes. Bake until the edges of the bars turn golden-brown and start to pull away slightly from the sides of the pan. Remove from the oven and sprinkle with the sea salt (if using).\n6 Cool completely before lifting the bars out of the pan using the parchment paper. (Stick them in the fridge for a few hours or overnight if needed to help firm up.) Cut into 24 pieces and store in an airtight container with wax paper or parchment paper between layers.\nThe flavor of the bars is even better the day after baking. Bars stored at room temperature will be fairly soft and are best eaten within 3 to 5 days. For firm and chewy bars, store in the fridge for up to a week.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHow to Make Butterscotch Sauce\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 25 minutes\nINGREDIENTS\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter\n1 cup of tightly packed dark brown sugar\n\xc2\xbe cup heavy whipping cream (not ultra-pasteurized)\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nButterscotch sauce takes about a half an hour to make, from start to finish.\n1 Have everything ready to go: First, before you begin, make sure you have everything ready to go - the cream and the brown sugar next to the pan, measured and waiting. Making butterscotch is a fast process that cannot wait for hunting around for ingredients.\n2 Melt butter, add brown sugar: In a heavy bottomed stainless steel 2 quart saucepan, melt butter over low to medium heat. Just before butter is melted, add all dark brown sugar at once and stir with wooden spoon until sugar is uniformly wet.\n3 Stir infrequently: Stir infrequently until mixture goes from looking grainy to molten lava. Make sure to get into the corners of your pot, and watch closely to notice how the mixture changes. It will take about 3 to 5 minutes.\n4 Note the texture: Right before you add the cream, the caramelizing brown sugar will begin to look and feel more like liquid and less like thick wet sand.\n5 Add the cream, let boil: At this point add all the cream at once and replace your spoon with a whisk. Lower heat a little and whisk cream into mixture.\nWhen liquid is uniform, turn heat back to medium and whisk every few minutes for a total of 10 minutes or until it registers 225\xc2\xb0F on a digital or candy thermometer.\n6 Let rest, then transfer to storage vehicle to cool: After liquid has been boiling on the stove for its 10 minutes, turn heat off and let rest for a minute or two before transferring into a heatproof storage vessel. (I prefer a stainless steel or glass bowl.) Cool to room temperature.\n7 Taste, add salt and vanilla extract to taste: When butterscotch liquid is room temperature, take a small taste. It's important to know what cooked brown sugar and butter tastes like, and what happens when transforming that flat sweetness into real butterscotch flavor.\nWhisk in half the salt and vanilla extract. Taste again. Add more salt and vanilla extract until the marvelous taste of real butterscotch is achieved.\nButterscotch makes a fantastic topping for ice cream.\nChill butterscotch sauce in a non-reactive container with a tightly fitting lid only after sauce has chilled completely. It will keep for one month refrigerated, that is if you can keep from eating it all the moment it has cooled down and been seasoned to your liking.\nHello!

Mix together the brown sugar white sugar dredging mixture in another bowl and set aside.\n3 Brown the butter: Place 10 tablespoons of butter into a thick-bottomed skillet over medium heat. The butter will foam a bit before subsiding. Once the butter takes on a tan color and begins to smell nutty take it off of the heat. Add the other two tablespoons of butter and mix it in until it melts. (See tutorial on how to brown butter.)\n4 Make the cookie dough: Pour the brown butter into a mixing bowl fitted with a paddle attachment. Add the brown sugar and salt and mix. Add the egg, egg yolk, and vanilla extract and mix together, scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl at least once.\nAdd the flour mixture in three increments being sure to scrape down the sides and bottom once or twice. Mix just until the flour is incorporated. The dough will be very thick.\n5 Shape the cookies: Take 1/2 to full tablespoon-sized pieces of dough (you can make them a bit bigger or smaller to your liking, just make sure the pieces of dough are all the same size) and gently roll them into ball shapes.\nDredge them in the sugar dredging mixture until well-coated.\nPlace on the baking sheet and sprinkle with a little bit of the sprinkling salt (be reserved with the salt as very little goes a long way).\n6 Bake the cookies: Bake at 375\xc2\xb0F for 10-12 minutes or until the edges have browned a bit. Be careful not to over-bake.\n8 Cool and serve: Allow to cool on the sheet for one minute before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. Tastes best with a glass of milk for dipping.

Set four ramekins or oven-safe bowls out and a large baking dish.\n2 Make butterscotch base with butter, sugar, salt, cream and milk: In a saucepan melt the butter. Once melted add the brown sugar and salt, stir until well combined.\nAdd the cream and milk to the sugar mixture. Heat until steamy and tiny, pinprick-sized bubbles begin to show around the side of the pot and the ingredients are combined (about 170\xc2\xb0F to 180\xc2\xb0F). You do not want it to boil or even simmer as this will cause scalding or curdling of the milk. Remove from heat immediately.\n3 Temper the egg yolks: Slowly, in a thin stream, pour the heated sugar-dairy mixture into the egg yolks, whisking constantly so that the egg yolks are tempered by the warm mixture, but not cooked by it.\n4 Add vanilla and strain mixture through sieve: Stir in the vanilla extract. Pour through a fine mesh sieve to catch any cooked bits of egg.\n5 Pour mixture into ramekins, prepare water bath: Ladle the mixture evenly into the ramekins. Place ramekins in a heavy bottomed pan and pour the hot water into the pan until the water rises halfway up the sides of the ramekins.\nLightly tent the entire pan (not each individual ramekin) with some vented foil. The foil can simply be crimped on two opposite sides, it shouldn't be airtight.\n6 Bake: Bake at 325\xc2\xb0F for 45-50 minutes. Be sure to rotate the pan half way through cooking. If you shake them they will have a jell-o-like wobble. It should not ripple or move like a liquid when you shake it. Don't worry as they will set up after they cool.

b"Save It Print\nCorned Beef and Cabbage Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 2 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 4 to 6\nCorned beef is cured in a salt mixture, so it can be very salty, depending on the source. We recommend first bringing the corned beef to a boil in plain water, and discarding the water, (repeat for less salt), before proceeding with the baked version.\nINGREDIENTS\nCorned Beef (baked)\n3 pounds corned beef (in package)\n10 whole cloves\n1/4 cup hot sweet honey mustard\n2 tablespoons brown sugar\nCorned Beef (boiled)\n3 pounds corned beef (in package, including spice packet)\nCabbage (saut\xc3\xa9ed)\nExtra virgin olive oil and butter\n1 medium yellow onion, chopped\n1 cloves garlic, minced\n1 large head of cabbage, sliced into 3/8-inch to 1/2-inch wide slices\nSalt\nCabbage (boiled)\n1 large head of cabbage, sliced into 3/8-inch to 1/2-inch wide slices\nAdditional vegetables such as a couple carrots (cut to 1 inch pieces) or several new potatoes (quartered)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nCorned Beef (Baked)\n1 Lightly boil to remove excess salt: Take the corned beef from the package and discard the spice packet. Note that one side of the roast should have a layer of fat, the other side should have distinct lines indicating the grain of the beef.\nCorned beef can be very salty, especially when baked. To remove some of the salt before cooking, place it in a pot fat side up. Cover with water, bring to a boil, and discard the water. Repeat to remove even more salt.\n2 Top with cloves, honey mustard, brown sugar: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Lay the corned beef, fat side up, on a large piece of heavy duty, wide, aluminum foil (you may have to get creative with the way you wrap the beef if your foil isn't wide enough).\nInsert the cloves into the top of the slab of corned beef, evenly spaced. Spread the top with the hot sweet honey mustard. Sprinkle brown sugar over the top.\n3 Wrap in foil and bake: Wrap the corned beef with foil in a way that allows for a little space on top between the corned beef and the foil, and creates a container to catch the juices. Place foil-wrapped corned beef in a shallow roasting pan and bake for 2 hours at 350\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Add more honey mustard, broil: Open the foil wrapping, spread a little more honey mustard over the top of the corned beef, and broil it for 2-3 minutes, until the top is bubbly and lightly browned.\n5 Slice: Let rest for 5 to 10 minutes, then place on cutting board. Pull out and discard the cloves.\nLift the corned beef up to see which direction the grain of the meat is.  Then cut the meat at a diagonal, across the grain of the meat, into 1/2-inch thick slices.\nServe immediately.\nCorned Beef (Boiled)\n1 Place corned beef in a large (6 to 8 quart) pot. Cover the beef with an inch water. Add the contents of the spice packet to the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer.\nSimmer for 2-3 hours, until the corned beef is fork tender. Remove from pot to a cutting board. (Reserve cooking liquid for boiling cabbage, if you plan to boil and not saut\xc3\xa9 the cabbage.)\nCut slices across the grain, into 1/2-inch thick slices. Serve.\nCabbage (Saut\xc3\xa9ed)\n1 Heat 2 Tbsp olive oil (enough to well coat the pan) on medium high to high heat in a large, wide pot (8-quart if available) or large, high-sided saut\xc3\xa9 pan. Add chopped onions, cook for a couple of minutes, then add garlic.\n2 Add a third of the sliced cabbage to the pan. Sprinkle with a little salt and stir to coat with oil and mix with onions.\nSpread out the cabbage evenly over the bottom of the pan and do not stir until it starts to brown. If the heat is high enough, this should happen quickly. The trick is to have the burner hot enough to easily brown the cabbage, but not so hot that it easily burns.\nWhen the bottom of the cabbage is nicely browned, use a metal spatula to lift it up and flip it, scraping the browned bits as you go.\n3 Once the cabbage in the pan has browned on a couple of flips, add another third of the cabbage to the pan. Mix well, then spread out the cabbage and repeat. Add a bit of butter to the pan for flavor, and to keep the cabbage from sticking too much to the pan. Once this batch has cooked down a bit and browned, add the remaining third of the cabbage and repeat.\nServe with the corned beef. Serve with boiled new potatoes. Can be made ahead and reheated.\nCabbage (Boiled)\n1 Once you have removed the corned beef from the pot, add the cabbage and any other vegetables (carrots, new potatoes) to the pot. Taste the liquid.

b'Print\nNew England Boiled Dinner Recipe\nCook time: 4 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nCorned beef can be pretty salty, so if you are making boiled dinner with corned beef you may want to put it in a pot, cover with cold water, bring to a boil, and then discard the water before starting the recipe. If the broth ends up being too salty, you can serve just the meat and vegetables, without the broth, or add water to the broth to dilute it.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 1/2 pounds corned beef brisket or plain beef brisket\n15 peppercorns\n8 whole cloves\n1 bay leaf\nSalt, if using plain brisket\n2 medium sized turnips, peeled and quartered\n4 red new potatoes, peeled and quartered\n3 large carrots, cut into thirds and the thickest pieces quartered lengthwise\n1 small head cabbage, cut into fourths\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Put corned beef in a pot, cover with water, add seasonings, simmer: Put the brisket in a 5 or 6 quart Dutch oven and cover with an inch of water.\nIf you are using corned beef brisket and it does not come already packed in seasoning, add peppercorns, cloves, and a bay leaf to the pot.\nIf using plain brisket, add a teaspoon of salt for every quart of water.\nBring to a simmer and then cover, lower the heat until it is barely simmering. Keep at a low simmer for four hours or until the meat is tender (a fork goes through easily).\n2 Remove meat, add vegetables, simmer: Remove the meat and set aside, keeping the meat warm. Add the vegetables to the pot. Check the broth for taste. If it is too salty, add a little more water to taste.\nRaise the temperature and bring the soup to a high simmer. Cook at a high simmer until done, about 15-30 minutes longer, depending on the size of the cut of your vegetables.\n\n3 Slice meat across the grain: Slice the meat in thin slices across the grain. You may find it easier to slice if you first cut the roast in half along the same direction as the grain of the meat. Then slice smaller lengths across the grain.\n\nServe in bowls, a few pieces of meat in each, add some of the vegetables and some broth. Serve with horseradish or mustard or both.\nHello!

b"Print\nPolish Hunter\xe2\x80\x99s Stew Recipe\nPrep time: 40 minutesCook time: 3 hoursYield: Serves 10 to 12\nI used beer as the liquid, although lots of people use red wine. If you are making the tomato-based version, skip the beer and use the can of tomato sauce. If you cannot drink alcohol, use some beef stock.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 ounce dried porcini or other wild mushrooms\n2 Tbsp bacon fat or vegetable oil\n2 pounds pork shoulder\n1 large onion, chopped\n1 head cabbage (regular, not savoy or red), chopped\n1 1/2 pounds mixed fresh mushrooms\n1-2 pounds kielbasa or other smoked sausage\n1 smoked ham hock\n1 pound fresh Polish sausage (optional)\n1 25-ounce jar of fresh sauerkraut (we recommend Bubbies, which you may be able to find in the refrigerated section of your local supermarket)\n1 bottle of pilsner or lager beer\n1 Tbsp juniper berries (optional)\n1 Tbsp black peppercorns\n1 Tbsp caraway seeds\n2 Tbsp dried marjoram\nSalt\n20 prunes, sliced in half (optional)\n2 Tbsp tomato paste (optional)\n1 15-ounce can tomato sauce (optional)\n1-2 Tbsp mustard or horseradish (optional)\nMETHOD\n1 Pour hot tap water over the dried mushrooms and submerge them for 20-40 minutes, or until soft. Grind or crush the juniper berries and black peppercorns roughly; you don\xe2\x80\x99t want a powder. Cut the pork shoulder into large chunks, about 2 inches. Cut the sausages into similar-sized chunks. Drain the sauerkraut and set aside. Clean off any dirt from the mushrooms and cut them into large pieces; leave small ones whole.\n2 Heat the bacon fat or vegetable oil in a large lidded pot for a minute or two. Working in batches if necessary, brown the pork shoulder over medium-high heat. Do not crowd the pan. Set the browned meat aside.\n3 Put the onion and fresh cabbage into the pot and saut\xc3\xa9 for a few minutes, stirring often, until the cabbage is soft. Sprinkle a little salt over them. The vegetables will give off plenty of water, and when they do, use a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits off the bottom of the pot. If you are making the tomato-based version, add the tomato paste here. Once the pot is clean and the cabbage and onions soft, remove from the pot and set aside with the pork shoulder.\n4 Add the mushrooms and cook them without any additional oil, stirring often, until they release their water. Once they do, sprinkle a little salt on the mushrooms. When the water is nearly all gone, add back the pork shoulder, the cabbage-and-onion mixture, and then everything else except the prunes. Add the beer, if using, or the tomato sauce if you're making the tomato-based version. Stir well to combine.\n5 You should not have enough liquid to submerge everything. That\xe2\x80\x99s good: Bigos is a \xe2\x80\x9cdry\xe2\x80\x9d stew, and besides, the ingredients will give off more liquid as they cook. Bring everything to a simmer, cover the pot and cook gently for at least 2 hours.\n6 Bigos is better the longer it cooks, but you can eat it once the ham hock falls apart. Check at 2 hours, and then every 30 minutes after that. When the hock is tender, fish it out and pull off the meat and fat from the bones Discard the bones and the fat, then chop the meat roughly and return to the pot. Add the prunes and cook until they are tender, at least 30 more minutes.\nBigos is best served simply, with rye bread and a beer. If you want a little kick, add the mustard or horseradish right before you eat it. Bigos improves with age, too, which is why this recipe makes so much: Your leftovers will be even better than the stew was on the first day.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nPork Chops with Braised Cabbage Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 4 to 6\nWe used large, bone-in pork chops for this recipe, but any style pork chop\xe2\x80\x94thick or thin, bone-in or boneless\xe2\x80\x94will work.\nThe ultimate cooking time may depend on if you are using pork chops taken directly from the fridge or chops that have been allowed to come closer to room temperature before cooking. Thin chops you can take directly from the refrigerator. Thick chops should probably sit out for a bit before cooking.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 teaspoons bacon fat, butter or extra virgin olive oil\n1 large onion, sliced 1/4-inch, about 2 cups\n1/2 head of cabbage, sliced 1/4-inch wide slices\nSalt\n1/4 teaspoon celery seed\n1 teaspoon caraway seed\n1/2 cup stock (chicken, beef, or vegetable) or water\n1 tablespoon mustard, preferably Dijon\n1 tablespoon malt or cider vinegar\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon bacon fat or extra virgin olive oil\n4 pork chops\nMETHOD\n1 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions and cabbage: Heat the bacon fat (or butter or olive oil) in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium-high heat.\nAdd the onion and saut\xc3\xa9, stirring only occasionally, until the edges of the onions begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle salt over the onions as they cook.\nAdd the sliced cabbage and toss to combine. Cook for a minute or two, then add the celery seed, caraway, and stock. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook, covered for 10 minutes.\n2 Stir in mustard and vinegar: After 10 minutes, remove from heat, but leave the cover on the pan. Wait another 5 minutes, then uncover the pan and mix in the mustard and vinegar. Add salt and black pepper to taste.\n3 Cook the pork chops in a separate pan: As soon as you cover the cabbage pan in step 1, heat a tablespoon of bacon fat or oil in a cast iron frying pan on medium high heat. Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels. Sprinkle them with salt and lay them in the pan, working in batches if necessary as to not crowd the pan.\nTip: Place the chops in the pan so that the thickest, boniest parts are near the center of the pan where they get the most heat.\nAs soon as the chops are nicely browned on one side, about 2 minutes or so, flip them and sear them on the other side. If your pork chops are less than 3/4-inch thick, and you are using a cast iron pan, once the chops are seared on the second side, remove the pan from heat and let the chops sit in the hot pan until cooked through (you can use the finger test to check for the doneness of the meat). If you are not using a cast iron pan, just remove the pan from heat and cover the pan for a few minutes until the chops are done.\nIf your chops are thicker than 3/4-inch, and you are using a cast iron pan, remove the pan from heat and cover it, letting the chops finish cooking for about 5 minutes. If not using a cast iron pan, keep the chops covered on low heat for another 5 minutes after searing.\n4 Let chops rest, serve with cabbage: Remove the chops from the pan and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve alongside the cabbage.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'

I hope you and your guests find as much joy and pleasure in this simple recipe as we do."\nAdapted from Dishing Up the Dirt by Andrea Bemis, copyright \xc2\xa9 2017. Published by Harper Wave, an imprint of Harper Collins Publishers.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the cabbage:\n1 medium-sized head of cabbage (about 1 1/2 pounds)\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\nFor the bacon gremolata:\n3/4 cup roasted unsalted almonds\n4 strips (about 1/4 pound) good-quality thick-cut bacon\n3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley\n1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest\nPinch of kosher salt\nTo serve:\nFreshly grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the oven to 400F. Arrange two oven racks in the upper and lower third of the oven.\n2 Slice the cabbage: Peel off one or two of the thin, limp outer layers of the cabbage. Trim the stem so that it is flush with the bottom of the cabbage (if it isn\'t already).\nSet the cabbage upright and slice into 1-inch thick slices. Don\'t worry if a few of the outer layers unfurl or fall away.\n3 Brush the cabbage slices with olive oil: Use a pastry brush to cover both sides of the cabbage slices with olive oil, or use your fingers to rub the oil in. Season both sides with a little salt and pepper.\n4 Roast the cabbage: Arrange the cabbage slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast on the lower oven rack for 35 to 45 minutes, flipping the slices halfway through cooking.\nWhen done, both sides should be seared an even golden-brown with crispy edges and the center of the slices should be tender.\n5 While the cabbage is roasting, prepare the bacon gremolata. If using unroasted almonds, arrange them on another sheet pan and roast in the upper part of the oven for about 10 minutes, until toasted and fragrant. Remove from the oven, cool briefly, then finely chop using a chef\'s knife (or pulse a few times in a food processor, but be careful not to over process or you\'ll make almond butter!)\nCook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until very crispy. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. When cool, roughly chop.\nCombine the chopped almonds, chopped bacon, minced parsley, lemon zest, and a pinch of kosher salt in a small mixing bowl. Toss to combine and set aside. (This bacon gremolata can be prepared ahead and kept refrigerated in an airtight container for about a week.)\n6 To serve: As soon as the cabbage slices are done roasting, transfer to a serving platter or individual plates. Sprinkle with a few spoonfuls of bacon gremolata and grated Parmesan cheese. Serve warm.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

For this version, I discard the packaged spices, and instead make my own blend for a more flavorful, satisfying brisket.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the corned beef\n1 flat-cut corned beef brisket (about 4 pounds)\n1/4 teaspoon mustard seed\n1/4 teaspoon coriander seed\n1/8 teaspoon whole cloves\n1/8 teaspoon whole peppercorns\n2 to 3 bay leaves\n1 large onion, peeled and quartered\n6 Yukon gold potatoes (about 1 pound), halved, or quartered, if large\n1 small head of cabbage (about 1 3/4 pounds), outer tough leaves removed and cut into 6 wedges\n12 slender carrots (about 1 pound), peeled and left whole\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley (for garnish)\nDijon or grainy mustard (for serving)\nFor the horseradish sauce (Optional)\n1 cup sour cream\n3 tablespoons whole milk\n1 tablespoon lemon juice, or more, to taste\n1 tablespoon prepared horseradish in brine, or more, to taste\n1/2 teaspoon Dijon mustard\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the horseradish sauce (optional): In a bowl, stir the sour cream and milk together until blended. Stir in the lemon juice, horseradish, and mustard. Add the salt, pepper, and parsley, and taste. Add more horseradish or lemon juice, if you like. Cover and set in the refrigerator until ready to serve.\n2 Preheat the oven: Preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xbaF.\n3 Prepare the meat for braising: Discard the spice packet that came with the beef. In a Dutch oven or other large, heavy-bottomed pot, place the brisket, mustard seed, coriander seed, cloves, peppercorns, bay leaves, and onion quarters. Add enough cold water to just cover the meat.\n4 Braise the meat: Over medium heat on the stovetop, bring the water to a boil. Cover the pot and place in the oven for 3 1/2 hours, or until the beef is very tender when pierced with a fork. Remove the meat from the broth with tongs and transfer it to a shallow baking dish or baking sheet.\n5 Brown the meat: Increase the oven temperature to 425\xc2\xb0F. Place the corned beef in the oven with a ladle of stock, and bake for 10 to 15 minutes, or until the top browns. Transfer the meat to a cutting board, cover with foil to keep warm, and let rest while you cook the vegetables. Turn off the oven.\n6 Strain the stock, cook the vegetables, and slice the meat: In a fine mesh strainer, strain the stock and return it to the pot. Add the salt. With a ladle, skim the fat that rises to the top. Bring it to a boil.\nAdd the potatoes and adjust the heat to a simmer. Cook for 5 minutes. Add the cabbage wedges and carrots, cover and bring to a simmer again. Cook for 15 to 20 minutes, or until the potatoes, carrots, and cabbage are tender.\nTransfer them to a deep platter, cover with foil, and keep them warm in the turned-off oven.\n7 Slice and serve the corned beef: Slice the beef across the grain into 1/4-inch thick slices. Transfer them to the platter with the vegetables, and spoon a few ladles of stock over the meat and vegetables. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Serve with mustard and/or horseradish sauce.\nHello!

It does add to the flavor. If you have a dietary restriction that prohibits wine, just omit.\nINGREDIENTS\nOne 4 pound chicken, cut into serving pieces, trimmed of excess fat (or 3 1/2 to 4 pounds of chicken thighs, bone in, skin on)\nSalt\n2 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n1 medium onion, thinly sliced root to tip, about 1 1/2 cups\n1 red or green bell pepper, seeded, sliced into 1/4-inch wide slices\n8 ounces cremini mushrooms, thickly sliced\n2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced\n1/3 cup white or red wine\n2 1/2 to 3 cups peeled and chopped, firm ripe tomatoes, with their juices,  or 1 28 ounce can of plum tomatoes in their juice\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 teaspoon dry thyme (or 2 teaspoons fresh, chopped)\n1 teaspoon dry oregano (or 2 teaspoons fresh, chopped)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the chicken: Rinse chicken and pat dry.

Cook until nicely browned, about 5 minutes, then turn over and lightly brown the other side.\nRemove chicken to a bowl, set aside. Drain off all but 2 tablespoons of the rendered fat. If you have less than 2 Tbsp of fat in the pan, add more olive oil until you have about that much oil coating the pan.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions, bell peppers, mushrooms, garlic: Add the sliced onions, bell peppers, and mushrooms to the pan. Increase the heat to medium high.\nCook until the onions are translucent, and the mushrooms have given up most of their moisture, stirring frequently, about 10 minutes.\nAdd the garlic to the pan and cook a minute more.\n3 Deglaze pan with wine, add tomatoes, spices: Add the wine and scrape up any browned bits at the bottom of the pan. Simmer until the wine is reduced by half. Add the tomatoes.\nStir in the pepper, thyme, oregano, and about a teaspoon of salt. Test and taste to adjust. Simmer uncovered for another 5 minutes.\n4 Add chicken back to pan, partially cover, cook until tender: Place the chicken pieces on top of the tomatoes and onions, skin side up. Lower the heat and cover the skillet with the lid slightly ajar.\nCook the chicken on a low simmer, turning and basting from time to time. Cook until the thighs are tender, about 30 to 40 minutes.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Discard them.\n2 Make one long vertical slice down the body of the prickly pear.\n3 Slip your finger into the slice and grab a hold of the skin.\n4 Peel back the skin: Begin to peel back the thick fleshy skin that\'s wrapped around the prickly pear. Discard the skin. You\'ll be left with the prickly pear itself.\nThe flesh is studded with tons of little edible seeds, if you like them, feel free to just chop the prickly pear up and eat, seeds and all.\n5 Extract the juice: To extract the prickly pear juice, place the "husked" prickly pears into a blender or food processor and pulse until liquefied.\nPlace the juice into a fine mesh sieve and push out the juice into a pitcher or bowl. Discard the remaining pulp and seeds.\nUse the juice as you like. Depending on the size of the prickly pears, 6 to 12 prickly pears will get you about 1 cup of juice. It\'s great mixed in with some fresh lemonade, just use equal parts of prickly pear juice to lemonade.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nCactus and Corn Salsa Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Makes 3 cups\nIf your farmers market doesn\xe2\x80\x99t sell cactus, you can find it in most Latin grocery stores in the produce aisle, either whole or already prepped and chopped.\nYou can also buy it in a jar in the Mexican food aisle of your grocery store, but fresh paddles taste far better. You\xe2\x80\x99ll want fresh paddles for this recipe.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 nopales cactus paddles, spikes removed*\n2 green tomatoes, cored and cut in half\n1/2 large, white onion, peeled and cut into 4 chunks\n2 jalape\xc3\xb1o chiles, red or green, more or less to taste\n1 teaspoon extra virgin olive oil plus more to grease baking sheet\n1 cup frozen corn**\n1 cup cilantro, stems removed\n1 garlic clove, peeled\nJuice from 1/2 a lime, about 1 tablespoon\n2 tablespoons tequila, optional\n1 teaspoon dried Mexican oregano\nSalt to taste\nTortilla chips, to serve\n*This recipe is designed for the whole paddles, but you may be able to make it with bagged cut cactus for nopalitos if that's all that is available in the market. Just arrange them close together on the roasting pan while you roast the vegetables so they don't dry out.\n**You can also use freshly cooked corn or grilled corn, stripped from the cob. In this case, skip the corn roasting in step 2, and just add to the salsa in the last step.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep cactus paddles: Heat oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. Working with a large sharp knife with a fairly straight edge, scrape off any remaining prickles or nubs on the cactus paddles.\nCut the paddles crosswise into 1-inch thick strips. Lightly grease a baking sheet with olive oil.\n2 Roast the cactus paddles, onion and jalape\xc3\xb1os in oven: Place cactus, green tomatoes, white onion and jalape\xc3\xb1os on the baking sheet in preheated 425\xc2\xb0F oven for 12 minutes. The cactus should still be slightly crisp when pierced with a fork.\n3 Roast the corn kernels: Heat a cast iron or stick-free skillet with 1 teaspoon olive oil over medium heat on the stove top. When the pan is heated, add frozen corn and spread out in an even layer. Do not stir the corn. Allow it to roast in the hot pan for about 2 to 3 minutes.\nThe corn should become browned and roasted. You can check by gently flipping a few pieces with the corner of a spatula.\nWhen corn is browned, stir and roast for another 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat. Place corn in a small bowl and set aside.\n4 Pulse in a food processor: Place the oven roasted vegetables in a food processor with the cilantro, garlic, lime juice, tequila, oregano and salt. Pulse until nearly smooth, about 30 seconds.\n(Be careful when you remove the lid on the food processor\xe2\x80\x94the heat released from the peppers will zoom up your nose and down your throat, so don\xe2\x80\x99t stand directly over the open food processor.)\n5 Stir in the roasted corn: Pour the salsa into a serving dish. Stir the roasted corn into the finished salsa. Allow to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes to 1 hour. Serve with tortilla chips.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nShrimp Gumbo with Andouille Sausage Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6-8\nIf you are not familiar with fil\xc3\xa9 (fee-lay), it is a powder made from dried sassafras leaves. It is a powerful thickener, but must be added at the end of cooking or it will form slimy, ropey strands in the gumbo. Fil\xc3\xa9 is available in many supermarkets (we found ours at Whole Foods), or online.\nNote that you can make your own shellfish stock with the shells from the shrimp. Put the shrimp shells and tail tips in a pot and cover with 2 quarts of water.  Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and simmer uncovered for an hour. Strain and use in this recipe for the stock. Diluted bottle clam juice will also work as shellfish stock in this recipe. Read more here.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/2 cup peanut oil, or other vegetable oil\n1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n1 green bell pepper, chopped\n1 medium onion, chopped\n3 celery stalks, chopped\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n1 tablespoons Cajun seasoning\n1 quart shellfish or chicken stock, plus 1 cup water (see Recipe Note)\n2 teaspoons Worcestershire sauce\n8-12 ounces smoked andouille sausage, cut into 1/4-inch thick rounds\n2 pounds shrimp, peeled and deveined\nSalt and pepper to taste\n3-5 green onions, white and green parts, chopped\nFil\xc3\xa9 powder (optional)\nHot sauce (such as Tabasco) to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the roux. Heat the peanut oil in a large, thick-bottomed pot, such as a Dutch oven, on medium high heat, for a minute or two. Whisk in the flour and lower the heat to medium. Stir almost constantly, making sure to scrape the bottom of the pan as you stir.\nLet the roux cook until it is the color of peanut butter, then lower the heat to medium low. Keep cooking and stirring (careful, you want the flour to cook, not burn!) until the roux is the color of an old penny, about 20-30 minutes total time.\n2 Stir in the vegetables: Mix in the "holy trinity" of green pepper, onion and celery and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes.\nAdd the garlic and cook another 2 minutes. Stir in the Cajun seasoning.\n3 Slowly add stock, then simmer: In a separate pot, heat the stock and water until steamy. Slowly add the steamy stock and water to the bell pepper onion roux mixture, stirring constantly while you do so.\nBring the gumbo to a simmer and add the Worcestershire sauce and salt to taste. Simmer gently for 30 minutes.\nIf you find that the roux has broken a bit and oil is pooling on the surface of the gumbo, whisk in about another 1/2 to 1 cup of water. This will often "fix" it.\n4 Stir in the andouille sausage and cook for 5 minutes (andouille sausage is already cooked, so you just need to heat it).\n5 Add the shrimp, return to a simmer and cook another 5 minutes, until the shrimp has just cooked through. Add salt and black pepper to taste.\n6 Serve: Serve with white rice, garnished with green onions. To eat, sprinkle with fil\xc3\xa9 powder and hot sauce.\nHello!

And if you don't feel like making remoulade, smear the top of the bread with mayo and the bottom with mustard.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound medium shrimp, shelled, deveined and with tails removed\n3/4 cup fine cornmeal\n3/4 cup flour\n1 Tbsp Cajun seasoning\n1 teaspoon salt\n2 eggs, beaten\nPeanut oil for frying\n1/2 head iceberg lettuce, shredded\n2-3 tomatoes, sliced about 1/4 inch thick\n4 small French sandwich rolls\nRemoulade\n1/4 cup mustard, preferably Creole mustard\n1 1/4 cups mayo\n2 teaspoons prepared horseradish\n1 teaspoon pickle juice or vinegar\n1 teaspoon hot sauce (Crystal, Tabasco, etc)\n1 large garlic clove, minced and smashed\n1 Tbsp sweet paprika\n1-2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the remoulade sauce: If you are making your own remoulade, mix all the ingredients together in a bowl and set aside for 30 minutes or so; you don't have to wait that long, but the sauce will be better over time.\n2 Heat oil in pan: Pour enough peanut oil in a large frying pan to come up about 1/4 inch, and set the pan over medium-high heat until a small amount of flour sizzles immediately when you drop some in.\n3 Dredge shrimp: Mix the cornmeal, flour, Cajun seasoning and salt in a large bowl. Working with a few at a time, dredge the shrimp in the egg, then in the cornmeal-flour mixture.\n4 Fry shrimp: Shake off any excess breading and fry the shrimp until golden on both sides, about 2 minutes total. Set the fried shrimp aside on paper towels to drain.\n5 Assemble sandwiches: To assemble the sandwiches, slice the sandwich loaves almost all the way through and smear remoulade on both the top and bottom.\nLay down a layer of shredded lettuce on the bottom of the sandwich, then arrange the shrimp on top.\nLay 3-4 slices of tomato on the shrimp and press the top of the bread down on the bottom, compressing the sandwich a little.\nServe at once with hot sauce and a beer.\nHello!

b"Print\nChicken Gumbo with Andouille Sausage Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 3 hoursYield: Serves 10-12\nI include a recipe for my own Cajun spice blend, but you can use a commercial spice blend if you want.\nA word on the andouille sausage: try your best to find it. We've found it in regular supermarkets, and it comes fresh or smoked. Either is good. It can be spicy, however, so if you are sensitive to spicy foods, lower the amount of cayenne in the recipe and use a mild Italian sausage.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/3 pound bacon, diced\n2-3 pounds chicken thighs, skin on\nSalt\n1-2 pounds andouille sausage\n1/2 cup peanut or other vegetable oil\n1 cup flour\n2 green peppers, diced\n4 celery stalks, diced\n1 large onion, diced\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n1 quart chicken stock\n1 quart water\n1/2 to 1 pound okra, sliced into discs\n3 green onions, chopped\n1/2 cup fresh parsley, chopped\nCajun spice mix\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n1/2 to 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1 teaspoon celery seed\n2 Tbsp sweet paprika\n1 Tbsp garlic powder\n1 Tbsp dried thyme\n1 Tbsp dried oregano\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the bacon: Cook the diced bacon until crispy in a large stew pot set over medium heat. Remove the bacon and set aside; you'll add it back in when you serve your gumbo.\n2 Brown the chicken in the bacon fat: Once the bacon is cooked, set the chicken thighs skin side down in the bacon fat to crisp. Salt the meat side, which will be facing up in the pot.\nCook the chicken, without moving, for at least 4-5 minutes before trying to turn the chicken over.\nBrown the other side of the chicken thighs. Incidentally, you start with skin side down to render some fat, which you will need for the roux.\n3 Brown the sausages: Remove the browned chicken thighs and set aside. Brown the sausages in the fat, remove and set aside.\n4 Make the roux: If you want, measure how much fat is in the pot; it should be about 1/2 cup. Or, do what I do and add 1/2 cup peanut oil to the pot. Let this heat up a minute or two, then stir in 1 cup flour. Stir this almost constantly for the first few minutes, then every couple minutes or so thereafter.\nLower the heat to medium-low and cook this roux until it turns dark. How dark? I like my roux the color of coffee with just a tiny bit of cream.\nYou can go all the way to chocolate brown, but be careful! If you burn your roux you will need to start over and make it again. This whole process can take 30 minutes.\n5 Heat chicken stock: While you are stirring and cooking the roux, bring the chicken stock and water to a boil in a separate pot.\n6 Add onion, bell pepper, celery to roux, add garlic, then tomato paste: Add to the roux the onion, green pepper and celery and mix well. Let this cook, stirring often, for about 5 minutes.\nAdd the garlic, stir again and cook for another 2 minutes. Mix in the tomato paste.\n7 Ladle hot stock into the gumbo, stir in some spice: Using a large ladle, add the hot chicken stock to the gumbo. It will sizzle and seize up as the roux absorbs the liquid.\nKeep adding more stock, stirring all the time and scraping the bottom of the pot, to incorporate all the stock and all the roux.\nYou might not need all 2 quarts, but add enough to make the gumbo slightly more watery than you want it to be at the end\xe2\x80\x94remember you are going to cook this down for several hours.\nStir in half the Cajun spice mix, taste the gumbo, and add more if you want.\n8 Lower the heat, add the chicken, simmer: Lower the heat to medium-low and add back the chicken thighs. Now you can either eat the skin while it's still crispy, or toss it into the gumbo and chop it fine later. I tend to do half-and-half.\nSimmer this gently, stirring from time to time, until the meat wants to fall off the bones of the chicken, about 90 minutes. Remove the chicken and let it cool a bit.\n9 Add sausage, okra, chicken meat: While the chicken is cooling, cut the andouille sausage into thick discs and drop them in the gumbo.\nAdd the okra.\nPick the chicken meat from the bones and chop it roughly. Add it back to the gumbo.\nAt this point you can cook the gumbo for another hour, or up to several more hours, depending on how cooked down you want the final stew to be.\n10 Add green onions, parsley, bacon to serve: When you are ready to eat, add the green onions, parsley and bacon and stir well. Serve over rice, or with good French bread.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"
b"Save It Print\nRed Beans and Rice Recipe\nYield: Serves 8\nIf you have access to ham hocks and not shanks, you may want to make up the difference in meat (hocks have much less meat) with sausage. Just take 1/2 pound of Andouille sausage, slice, brown first before adding to the beans with the ham shanks.\nIf you do not eat pork, you might try making this with smoked turkey sausage, in which case I would replace some of the water with chicken stock.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 lb dry small red beans\n1 1/2 to 2 lbs meaty ham shanks\n4 cups water\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n1 large onion, chopped (about 2 cups)\n1 1/2 cups chopped celery\n1 cup chopped green bell pepper\n1 Tbsp Worcestershire sauce\n2 teaspoons of Cajun or Creole seasoning (Tony Chachere's or Zatarains) or to taste*\nTabasco sauce**\nSalt and pepper to taste\nCooked white rice (from about 3 cups raw rice)\n*If you don't have access to packaged seasoning, just skip it and add some thyme (fresh or dried), a bay leaf (in with the beans and shanks in step 2), and a little paprika\n**We used a combo of Chipotle Tabasco sauce and regular Tabasco, could also use cayenne pepper\nMETHOD\n1 Soak the beans: Place dried beans in a large bowl and cover them with cold water by a couple of inches. Let soak for 8 hours or overnight. (You can quick soak them by putting them in a bowl and pouring boiling water over them, covering them by 2 inches, then letting them soak for two hours.) Drain.\n2 Cook beans with ham, garlic, onion, water: Place beans, ham shanks, garlic, chopped onion, and water in a large (8-quart) pot and bring to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cover, simmer for 1 1/2 hours or until beans are tender.\n3 Remove ham shanks, separate meat from bones: Remove ham shanks from the pot to a dish. Let cool slightly then shred the meat away from the bones. Return the meat back to the pot.\n4 Add vegetables, seasonings, cook until thick: Add the celery, bell peppers, Worcestershire and seasonings. Cover and cook for another hour or until the mixture gets thick.\nSeason to taste with Tabasco sauce, salt and pepper.\nServe over rice.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nSlow Cooker Cajun-Spiced Stuffed Peppers Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 4 hoursYield: 5 to 6 servings\nLook for Cajun seasoning in the spice section at the grocery store. It is typically a mix of paprika, cayenne, garlic, cumin, oregano, and a few other dried spices.\nBe sure to buy bell peppers that are shaped like big cups and can stand upright on their own.\nYou can also cook these peppers in the oven: Put them in a baking dish, cover with foil, and bake at 400F for 50 to 60 minutes. Slice one pepper open to make sure the beef has cooked through.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound (450g) lean ground beef\n1 1/2 (225g) cups cooked brown rice\n1 1/4 cups (150g) diced yellow onions\n1 1/4 (115g) cups shredded mozzarella cheese\n3/4 cup (80g) corn kernels (fresh or frozen)\n1 1/2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\n1 teaspoon sea salt\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n5 to 6 large bell peppers\nSpecial Equipment:\n4- to 6-quart slow cooker, though any size will work as long as the peppers will stand upright\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Mix the filling: In a large bowl, mix the ground beef, cooked rice, onions, 3/4 cup of the mozzarella cheese, corn, Cajun seasoning, oregano, sea salt and paprika together.

Set filling aside (or cover and refrigerate for up to 24 hours).\n2 Prepare the peppers: Slice off the tops of the bell peppers. You don\xe2\x80\x99t need to cut off a lot; just enough to get the stem off. Remove the seeds and membrane from the insides of the peppers. The peppers should look like little cups that are ready for stuffing.\n3 Stuff each pepper with beef and rice filling. Carefully place each stuffed pepper into the slow cooker. Cover the pot.\n(The stuffed peppers can also be covered and refrigerated for up to 24 hours before cooking.)\n4 Set the slow cooker on low and cook for 4 to 5 hours. The peppers are done when the meat is cooked through. About 10 minutes before the peppers are done, sprinkle the remaining cheese on top of the peppers and close the lid.\n5 Drain excess liquid and serve: Carefully remove peppers from the slow cooker. Some of your peppers may have filled with some liquid. That\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly normal. I like to gently tip the peppers over to drain the excess liquid before serving. Be careful when doing this, as the peppers may still be quite hot.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Print\nCajun Turkey Pot Pie Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hour, 15 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Serves 6-8\nYou can make the turkey pot pie either in individual ramekins or in one large casserole dish.\nINGREDIENTS\nFilling:\n5 Tbsp peanut oil or unsalted butter\n3 celery stalks, chopped\n1 1/2 cups chopped yellow or white onion\n1 large green pepper, chopped\n1-2 jalapeno peppers, chopped\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n3 cups diced, cooked turkey meat\n2 Tbsp Cajun seasoning*\nSalt\n1/3 cup all-purpose flour\n2 1/2 cups turkey or chicken stock\n1 cup dark beer (brown ale or Guinness)\n1 cup diced tomatoes\nPie Crust:\n1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) chilled unsalted butter, diced into 1/2-inch cubes\n3 to 4 Tbsp chilled ice water\nEgg Wash:\n1 egg yolk\n1 Tbsp cream\n*If you can't find Cajun seasoning in your local market, you can make your own with 3/4 teaspoon each of salt, pepper, dried oregano, dried thyme, and 1 1/2 teaspoons each of paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the pie crust dough: Pulse the flour and salt together in a food processor. Add the chilled butter cubes to the food processor and pulse 5 times. The dough should resemble a coarse cornmeal, with some pea-sized pieces of butter.\nSlowly add the chilled water (make sure there are no small ice cube bits), just a tablespoon at a time, pulsing once after each addition, until the dough just sticks together when you press some between your fingers.\n \n  Empty the food processor, placing the dough mixture on a clean surface. Use the heel of your palm to shmoosh the dough mixture onto the table surface a few times. This action will help flatten and spread the butter between layers of flour, so that the resulting dough will be flaky.\nOnce you've done this a few (5 or 6) times, use your hands to mold the dough into a disk. Sprinkle the disk with a little flour, wrap it in plastic wrap, and let it chill for an hour, or up to 2 days, before rolling out.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions, celery, green pepper, jalape\xc3\xb1o: Heat the oil over medium-high heat and saut\xc3\xa9 the onion, celery, green pepper and jalape\xc3\xb1o, stirring often, until they are soft, about 6-8 minutes.\n3 Add the garlic, turkey meat, Cajun seasoning, and salt. Mix well and cook another 1 minute, stirring once or twice.\n4 Finish making the filling: Bring the stock and beer to a boil in a small pot. Sprinkle the flour over the turkey and veggies and mix well. Cook for 4-5 minutes, stirring often and making sure no flour burns on the bottom of the pan.\nSlowly pour in the hot stock-beer mixture, stirring. It will seize up at first, then, as you pour in more stock and stir, will form a silky sauce for the turkey.\nAdd the tomatoes and cook until the mixture thickens, about 3-5 minutes.\nPour the filling into a 2-quart casserole or, if you wish, into individual ramekins.\n5 Prepare the crust: Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface to a little less than a quarter-inch thick. If you are using a casserole, roll into a sheet a little larger than the dish.\nIf you are using ramekins (use 10 ounce ramekins), cut the dough into 6 rounds that are slightly larger than the circumference of the ramekins.\n6 Top the filling with the crust dough: Lay the dough onto the filling. Fold the excess dough under itself and use the tines of a fork to press the dough against the edge of the ramekins. Cut a 1-inch vent into each individual pie, or several if you are making a casserole.\n7 Brush with egg wash: Whisk together in a small bowl the egg yolk and cream for an egg wash. Use a pastry brush to paint the egg wash over the crust. This will help the crust brown nicely.\n8 Bake: Bake at 400\xc2\xb0F for 25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden and the filling is bubbling. Let cool for at least 5 minutes before serving.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nPerfect Cheesecake Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 2 hours, 40 minutesChilling time: 4 hours or overnightYield: Makes 16 servings\nRecipe adapted from Dorie Greenspan's Baking: From My Home to Yours. Published with permission from author.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crust:\n1 3/4 cups (230g) of Graham cracker crumbs (from about 15 Graham crackers)\n2 Tbsp sugar\nPinch salt\n4 Tbsp plus 1 teaspoon (60g) unsalted butter (if using salted butter, omit the pinch of salt), melted\nFor the filling:\n2 pounds cream cheese (900g), room temperature\n1 1/3 cup granulated sugar (270g)\nPinch of salt\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n4 large eggs\n2/3 cup sour cream (160 ml)\n2/3 cup heavy whipping cream (160 ml)\nFor the sour cream topping:\n2 cups sour cream (475 ml)\n1/3 cup powdered sugar (35g)\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\nFor the raspberry sauce:\n12 ounces (340g) fresh raspberries\n1/2 cup granulated sugar (100g)\n1/2 cup water (120 ml)\nSpecial equipment:\n9-inch, 2 3/4-inch high springform pan\nHeavy-duty, 18-inch wide aluminum foil\nA large, high-sided roasting pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nPREPARE THE CRUST\n1 Process graham crackers, mix with sugar, salt, butter: Pulse the graham crackers in a food processor or blender until finely ground. Put in a large bowl, and stir in the sugar and salt. Stir in the melted butter.\nPreheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C), with rack in lower third of oven.\n2 Press the graham cracker crumbs into the bottom of the springform pan: Gently press down on the crumbs using your fingers, until the crumbs are a nice even layer at the bottom of the pan, with maybe just a slight rise along the inside edges of the pan.\n3 Bake the crust: Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake at 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. While the crust is cooling, you can skip ahead and start on the filling. Wait until the crust has cooled to wrap the pan in foil in the next step.\n4 Triple wrap pan in heavy duty foil: Prepare the springform pan so that no water leaks into it while cooking. Place a large 18-inch by 18-inch square of heavy duty aluminum foil on a flat surface.\nPlace the springform pan in the middle of the foil. Gently fold up the sides of the foil around the pan. Make sure to do this gently so that you don't create any holes in the foil.\nIf there are any holes, water will get into the pan and ruin the crust.\nPress the foil around the edges of the pan. Place a second large square of foil underneath the pan, and repeat, gently folding up the sides of the foil around the pan and pressing the foil against the pan.\nTo be triply safe, repeat with a third layer of heavy duty foil. Gently crimp the top of the foil sheets around the top edge of the pan.\nMAKE THE CHEESECAKE\n1 Beat cream cheese, then sugar: Cut the cream cheese into chunks and place in the bowl of an electric mixer, with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed for 4 minutes until smooth, soft and creamy. Add the sugar, beat for 4 minutes more.\n2 Add salt, vanilla, then eggs, then sour cream: Add the salt and vanilla, beating after each addition. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating for one minute after each addition. Add the sour cream, beat until incorporated.\n3 Add the heavy cream, beat until incorporated. Remember to scrape down the sides of the mixer bowl, and scrape up any thicker bits of cream cheese that have stuck to the bottom of the mixer that paddle attachment has failed to incorporate.\n4 Prepare pan and boiling water: Place the foil-wrapped springform pan in a large, high-sided roasting pan. Prepare 2 quarts of boiling water.\nHeat the oven to 325\xc2\xb0F (160\xc2\xb0C).\n5 Pour filling into pan: Pour the cream cheese filling into the springform pan, over the graham cracker bottom layer. Smooth the top with a rubber spatula.\n6 Place in oven: Place the roasting pan with the springform pan in it, in the oven, on the lower rack.\n7 Carefully pour the hot water into the roasting pan (without touching the hot oven), to create a water bath for the cheesecake, pouring until the water reaches halfway up the side of the springform pan, about 1 1/4 inches. (Alternatively you can add the water before putting the pan in the oven, whichever is easier for you.)\n8 Bake at 325\xc2\xb0F (160\xc2\xb0C) for 1 1/2 hours.\n9 Turn off the heat of the oven. Crack open the oven door 1-inch, and let the cake cool in the oven, as the oven cools, for another hour. This gentle cooling will help prevent the cheesecake surface from cracking.\n10 Chill 4 hours: Cover the top of the cheesecake with foil, so that it doesn't actually touch the cheesecake. Chill in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours, or overnight.\nFINISH AND SERVE THE CHEESECAKE\n1 Prepare the sour cream topping: Place sour cream in a medium sized bowl, stir in the powdered sugar and vanilla, until smooth. Chill until you are ready to serve the cake.\nNote that this recipe produces enough sour cream topping for a thick topping and some extra to spoon over individual pieces of cheesecake, if desired. If you would like a thinner layer of topping and no extra, reduce the sour cream topping ingredients in half.\n2 Prepare the raspberry sauce: Place raspberries, sugar, and water in a small saucepan. Use a potato masher to mash the raspberries. Heat on medium, whisking, about 5 minutes, until the sauce begins to thicken. Remove from heat. Let cool.\n3 Prepare the cheesecake to serve: Remove the cake from the refrigerator. Remove the foil from the sides of the pan, and place the cake on your cake serving dish. Run the side of a blunt knife between the edge of the cake and the pan.\nDorie recommends, and we've done with success, that you use a hair dryer to heat the sides of the pan to make it easier to remove. Open the springform latch and gently open the pan and lift up the sides.\nSpread the top with the sour cream mixture. Serve plain or drizzle individual slices with raspberry sauce.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHow to Make Classic Tiramisu\nPrep time: 45 minutesChilling time: 8 to 24 hoursYield: About 9 servings\nINGREDIENTS\n6 large egg yolks\n1 cup (200 grams) sugar, divided\n3 ounces (6 tablespoons) dark rum, divided\n1 1/2 cups (12 oz) mascarpone cheese, cold from the fridge\n1 cup heavy whipping cream, cold from the fridge\n1 cup boiling water\n1 tablespoon instant espresso powder\n1 (7-ounce) package ladyfingers\nCocoa powder for dusting the top\nSpecial equipment:\n8x8-inch baking dish\nSaucepan and heatproof bowl, or a double-boiler\nBalloon whisk\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the dish: Lightly oil an 8x8 inch baking dish.\n2 Whisk the yolks and sugar to make the zabaglione: Set a large heatproof bowl over a pan of simmering water to create a double boiler (the bowl should rest on the rim of the pan and the bottom should not touch the surface of the water).\nWhisk together the egg yolks and 3/4 cup of the sugar in the bowl. Continue whisking until the sugar has dissolved, the mixture has increased slightly in volume, and it looks light yellow color. Not sure? Rub a little of the mixture between two fingers (it will be warm, but not too hot to touch) \xe2\x80\x93 it should feel smooth and silky; if you feel any sugar granules, keep whisking.\n3 Add in the rum: Gradually whisk in 2 ounces (4 tablespoons) of the rum and continue whisking rapidly over the double boiler for about 10 minutes, until the mixture is thick, foamy, and very pale yellow. (You can also use a hand mixer for this step, if you prefer.)\nRemove the bowl from the double boiler and set aside until cooled to at least 90F or room temperature.\n4 Whip the mascarpone and cream: You can use either a hand mixer or a stand mixer with a whisk attachment for this step. If using a stand mixer, be very attentive and do not walk away while the mascarpone is whipping. Stand mixers are so powerful, that it's easy to overwhip, which causes the mascarpone to separate. You have a little more wiggle room with a hand mixer.\nWith a hand mixer or in the bowl of a stand mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the mascarpone on medium speed for 15 to 30 seconds, until it smooths out and softens. Be careful not to over-beat or else the mascarpone will separate and become grainy.\nWith the mixer still on medium speed, gradually add the cream in a thin, slow stream until it's all incorporated. This should take 1 to 2 minutes. Stop the mixer and scrape down the bowl. Continue beating with the mixer on medium-high speed for another 30 to 60 seconds, until the mixture holds firm, not-quite-stiff peaks.\n5 Mix the whipped cream and the zabaglione: Fold 1/3 of the whipped cream into the zabaglione to lighten it, then fold in the remaining whipped cream.\n6 Make the coffee dipping liquid for the ladyfingers: In a wide, shallow dish, whisk the remaining 1/4 cup sugar with the remaining 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of rum, the boiling water, and the espresso powder. Stir to dissolve the sugar and espresso.\n7 Assemble the tiramisu: Dunk one ladyfinger at a time in the espresso liquid, turning it so that all sides are evenly moistened \xe2\x80\x93 a quick dunk is all you need; any more and the ladyfingers start to disintegrate. Arrange the dunked ladyfingers in rows on the bottom of the baking dish.\nOnce you finish the layer, spread 1/2 of the mascarpone mixture over the top. Repeat dunking and arranging a second layer, and spread the remaining mascarpone over top.\n8 Chill the tiramisu: Cover the tiramisu and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours to give the tiramisu time to firm up and for the ladyfingers to soften.\n9 Serve: Dust with cocoa before serving. Serve in wedges directly from the pan. Leftovers will keep for about 5 days.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Save It Print\nFlourless Lemon Almond Cake Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Serves 8\nIt helps to separate the eggs first, while they are cold, and then let them sit to come to room temperature as you prep the other ingredients.  Eggs are easier to separate when cold, and they perform better as leavening agents when at room temperature.\nWhen whipping egg whites, make sure your equipment is perfectly clean. Any fat (or even bits of egg yolk in the whites) can keep the egg whites from properly whipping up.\nIf almond flour is not available at your market, you can grind up blanched, slivered almonds in a food processor until very finely ground.  I would start with a little more than 1 1/3 cups. Our local Whole Foods carries a Bob's Red Mill brand of finely ground blanched almond flour which is what we used for this recipe.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 eggs (large), separated into 4 egg yolks and 4 egg whites, room temperature (see how to separate eggs)\n2 Tbsp lemon zest, packed\n1/2 cup (100 g) white sugar, divided 1/4 cup (50 g) and 1/4 cup (50 g)\n1 1/2 cup lightly scooped (144 g) finely ground blanched almond flour\n1 teaspoon baking powder (make sure your baking powder is fresh!)\n1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom\n1 teaspoon white or cider vinegar\nPinch of salt\nPowdered sugar for sprinkling\nSpecial equipment:\n8 or 9-inch springform pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven, prepare pan: Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175 \xc2\xb0C).  Place a round of parchment paper on the bottom of a 8 or 9-inch springform pan, and grease it and the sides of the pan with butter or cooking spray.\n2 Beat egg yolks, lemon zest, 1/4 cup sugar: In a large bowl, beat together with a wooden spoon the egg yolks, lemon zest, and 1/4 cup sugar until smooth.\n3 Whisk almond flour, baking powder, cardamom, beat into egg yolk mixture: In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond flour, ground cardamom, and baking powder. Add the flour mixture to the egg yolk mixture and beat until well combined. The mixture should resemble a thick paste.\n4 Whip egg whites to soft peaks: With an electric mixer with a very clean bowl and clean whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, starting on low speed and gradually increasing the speed.\nWhen bubbles start to form, add a pinch of salt and the teaspoon of vinegar (both the salt and the vinegar will help the beaten egg whites maintain better structure, as will the sugar in the next step).\nAs the egg whites begin to increase in volume, sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, a little at a time, as you continue to beat the egg whites. Beat until soft peaks form.\n5 Fold beaten egg whites into almond mixture: Stir a third to a half of the beaten egg whites into the almond mixture to loosen it and make it lighter.\nThen gently fold the remaining whipped egg whites into the batter, a large scoopful at a time.\n6 Scoop batter into pan, bake: Gently scoop the batter into the prepared springform pan and place in the oven. Bake at 350\xc2\xb0F (175 \xc2\xb0C) for 30 minutes.\nRemove from the oven and let cool. Run a sharp knife around the edge of the cake helping it to separate from the side of the pan.\nRelease the springform pan sides, and gently move the cake (on parchment) to a cake serving plate. Sprinkle with a little powdered sugar before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"

b'Save It Print\nChocolate Peppermint Swiss Roll Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 20 minutesCooling and Chilling time: 1 1/2 to 2 hoursYield: 10 to 12 servings\nFor this recipe, you\'ll need a clean kitchen towel on hand. Cocoa powder and cake crumbs can stain, so make sure it\'s one you won\'t mind getting dirty.\nOnce the ganache is added, the cake is best served the day it is made (the ganache won\'t look as pretty the second day). Leftover cake that doesn\'t get devoured can be stored, covered, in the fridge for several days.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the Chocolate Sponge Cake:\n1/3 cup all-purpose flour\n1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder, plus extra for rolling the cake\n1/8 teaspoon kosher salt\n6 large eggs\n2/3 cup sugar\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted and cooled (but still liquid)\nFor the Peppermint Whipped Cream:\n1 1/4 cups heavy whipping cream\n2 tablespoons sugar\n1 teaspoon peppermint extract\nFor the Ganache and Peppermint Topping:\n1/2 cup heavy cream\n4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped, divided\n1 teaspoon light corn syrup\n1/4 cup crushed peppermint candies or candy canes\nSpecial Equipment:\nStandard half-sheet pan or baking sheet with a rim (approximately 13x17)\nOffset spatula\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 450F. Position a baking rack in the center of the oven.\n2 Prepare the baking sheet: Spray a 13 x 17-inch rimmed baking sheet with cooking spray, line bottom with parchment paper, then spray again and dust with cocoa powder, tapping out any excess. Set aside.\n3 Sift together the flour, cocoa powder, and salt for the cake. Set aside.\n4 Warm the eggs and sugar: Make a double boiler by filling a medium saucepan with 2 inches of water, and brining the water to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Combine the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract in the bowl of a stand mixer, or another large heatproof bowl, and set this bowl over the simmering water. The bowl should be larger than the pan and sit above the surface of the simmering water.\nBegin whisking the eggs, sugar, and vanilla extract with a sturdy whisk. Continue whisking until the sugar has dissolved and the egg mixture is pale and warm to the touch. Remove from heat.\n5 Beat the egg mixture until tripled in volume: Using a stand mixer with a whisk attachment or a hand mixer, beat egg mixture on high speed until mixture is very pale , has a shiny gloss, and has nearly tripled in volume. This will take 5 to 10 minutes depending your mixer.\n6 Fold the flour and cocoa mixture into the egg mixture in two batches: Sprinkle half of the flour and cocoa mixture over the surface of the eggs, and gently fold until just barely combined. Sprinkle the remaining flour and cocoa mixture over the top and fold until you see no more dry streaks and the mixture looks uniform.\n7 Drizzle the melted, cooled butter into the batter. Stir to combine.\n8 Working quickly, spoon mixture out onto prepared baking sheet. Use an offset spatula to spread batter out evenly.\n9 Bake for 6 to 7 minutes, or until cake has pulled away from sides and is springy to the touch. Cool cake 2 for 3 minutes, but no longer.\n10 While the cake is baking, prepare the kitchen towel for rolling: Find a clean kitchen towel that is larger than your baking sheet (or use two, overlapping). Dust it all over with cocoa powder.\n11 Roll the cake in the kitchen towel: With swift, confident motions, run a knife along the outside edge of the cake pan. Set the pan on its side, and then flip face down onto the dusted towel. Carefully lift the pan up and away, and peel away parchment.\nFold an edge of towel over one of the shorter sides of the cake, and gently roll the cake up. Set rolled cake on a wire rack and cool completely, an hour or longer.\n12 Make the whipped cream filling: Whip the heavy cream until is billowy, then add the sugar and peppermint extract. Continue whipping until the cream just barely holds firm peaks; be careful not to overwhip.\n13 Fill the cake with whipped cream: Gently unroll cake on a clean surface. Spread the whipped cream filling evenly over the cake, leaving a 1-inch border on all sides. Roll the cake back up again (this time without the towel!). If any whipped cream squeezes out as you roll, spoon it up and add it back in.\n14 Chill the cake: Wrap cake roll in parchment, then plastic wrap, and set in fridge to chill at least 30 minutes to set, or as long as overnight.\n15 When ready to finish the cake, make the ganache: Make a double boiler by filling a medium saucepan with 2 inches of water, and bringing the water to a gentle simmer over medium heat. Set a larger bowl on top of the saucepan, over the water.\nAdd the heavy cream, two-thirds of the chopped chocolate, and a pinch salt to the bowl. Stir until melted. Remove the bowl from heat, and stir in remaining chocolate and corn syrup.\n16 Drizzle the cake with ganache: Unwrap the chilled cake and set it on a platter seem-side down. Slip two pieces of parchment on either side of the "log" to catch the drips. Drizzle the prepared ganache over roll until roll is completely covered. Remove the parchment paper "drip catchers." Scatter the peppermint candy bits on the top.\n17 Chill and serve: Set the cake in the fridge and chill 20 minutes. Slice and serve!\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Strain out excess water.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crust:\n1 cup pecans\n1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs (approximately 4 graham crackers)\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n1 egg yolk\nFor the filling:\n2 15-ounce cans pumpkin puree (see Recipe Note)\n3 tablespoons all purpose flour\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n2 tablespoons vanilla extract\n2 tablespoons bourbon or other whiskey\n5 large eggs\n4 8-ounce packages cream cheese, room temperature\n2 cups (1 pound) brown sugar\nSpecial equipment:\n1 9-inch diameter, 3-inch tall springform pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make graham cracker pecan crust: Pulse pecans, flour, brown sugar, and graham cracker crumbs in a food processor. Add butter and egg yolk. Pulse until mixture is homogenous. Press into bottom of 9\xe2\x80\x9d springform pan and bake for 10 minutes at 375\xc2\xb0F. Remove from oven and let cool.\n2 Drain or strain any liquid from pumpkin pur\xc3\xa9e. Take pumpkin pur\xc3\xa9e and place on several layers of paper towels. Cover with several layers of paper towels and use your hands to gently squeeze out liquid from the pur\xc3\xa9e.\nNote that you will probably go through a lot of paper towels (can use tea towels too). Two 15-ounce cans of pur\xc3\xa9ed pumpkin should yield a little more than 2 cups of pur\xc3\xa9e, with the excess moisture removed. You want exactly 2 cups of the pur\xc3\xa9e.\n3 Mix spices with pumpkin pur\xc3\xa9e, bourbon, eggs: Whisk together the flour, cinnamon, ground ginger, grated nutmeg, and allspice in a medium bowl. With a wooden spoon (no need for a mixer for this step), mix in the salt, pumpkin pur\xc3\xa9e, vanilla, and bourbon. Beat in the eggs, one at a time.\n4 Mix cream cheese with brown sugar, add pumpkin mixture: In a large bowl, (helps to use a mixer for this step) combine the cream cheese and the brown sugar until fully creamed and smooth (no lumps). Gradually add the pumpkin mixture until fully incorporated. Bring a kettle of water to a boil.\n5 Line pan with 3 layers of thick foil: Place crust-baked springform pan in the middle of three layers of large sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil (to help prevent water-bath moisture from leaking into the pan). Fold the aluminum foil up the sides of the pan and trim. (You can also use a turkey roasting bag instead of the foil to keep the water out.)\n6 Pour filling into pan: Place the aluminum wrapped pan in a large roasting pan (large enough so that there is room on all sides). Pour the pumpkin cream cheese mixture into the springform pan.\n7 Pour hot water into roasting pan to create water bath: Place the roasting pan containing the springform pan in a 325\xc2\xb0F oven on the middle rack. Pour boiling water into the pan so that it comes halfway up the side of the springform pan.\n8 Cook for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off the oven heat and prop the oven door open. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven, cooling for another hour. Then remove from oven and let come to room temperature. Once it has cooled down, chill for several hours in the refrigerator, preferably overnight.\n9 When ready to serve, gently remove the cake from the springform pan.\nTo do this well, I recommend a tip by Dorie Greenspan in her book Baking: From My Home to Yours. To help ensure that the cake doesn't stick to the springform side as you unlock it, first run a blunt knife around the cake and then warm the sides of the pan with a hair dryer. Then carefully unlock the springform and lift off the sides.\nServe cheesecake with caramel sauce, candied pecans, and whipped cream.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

This banana cake is on the sweet side (it is a cake after all).\nIf you are trying to cut sugars, you may want to experiment dropping the sugar in the cake mixture by a half cup and cutting the amount of frosting in half.\nINGREDIENTS\nCake\n2 cups all purpose flour\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter\n1 cup white granulated sugar\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n2 eggs\nThe scraped insides of one vanilla bean, or 1 teaspoon of vanilla extract\n1 cup of mashed ripe bananas (2 large or 3 medium bananas)\n1/2 cup full fat sour cream\nFrosting\n6 ounces cream cheese, room temp\n4 Tbsp (1/4 cup) unsalted butter, room temp\n2 cups powdered sugar\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\nMETHOD\n1 Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) . In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt.\n2 Beat together in a mixer the butter and sugars. Beat in the eggs one at a time. Mix in the vanilla and mashed bananas.\n3 Mix in half of the flour mixture, then the sour cream, then the other half of the flour mixture.\n4 Spread batter evenly in a greased 10x15 baking pan. Bake at 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) for 20 minutes, or until nicely browned and the surface bounces back when you press it with your finger. Cool completely before frosting.\n5 To make the frosting, mix all of the ingredients together with an electric mixer. If too stiff to spread, add a teaspoon or two of water. Spread the frosting evenly over the cake and slice to serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan.\n2 Combine the dry ingredients: Sift the flour, cocoa, baking powder, soda, and salt into a large mixing bowl.\n3 Make the batter: In a measuring cup combine the boiling water, chocolate, and espresso. Cover and let the hot water melt the chocolate, about 10 minutes, and whisk until smooth. Check the water with your finger; it's fine if it's still a little warm, but it should no longer be hot to the touch.\nIn a separate bowl (or in your measuring cup, if it's large enough), combine chocolate-water with the sugar, eggs, oil, and vanilla extract. Whisk to combine.\nPour the chocolate mixture into the flour mixture and beat, using a stand mixer or a hand mixer, until just combined. Stop periodically and scrape the bottom of the bowl.\n4 Bake the cake: Spread the batter into the pan and bake for 25 to 35 minutes or until the top springs back to the touch, the sides of the cake have pulled slightly away from the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean.\nLeave the cake in the pan, and set it on a wire rack to cool completely before frosting, about 45 minutes.\n5 Make the frosting: Whisk together the egg yolks, evaporated milk, and brown sugar in a saucepan. Add the butter and warm over medium-high heat, stirring constantly until the mixture thickens, about 10 minutes. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla and salt, followed by the coconut and pecans.\nThe frosting should be thick, creamy, and nubbly with coconut and pecans.\n6 Finish the cake: Cool the frosting to room temperature and spread generously onto the cake. Serve the cake from the pan.\nThe cake can be made a few days ahead, but wait to top it with the coconut-pecan frosting until before serving. This cake is best served the same day it's frosted. Leftovers can be kept, covered, for 2 to 3 days at room temperature.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Save It Print\nTriple Ginger Gingerbread Cake Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 55 minutesYield: 9 to 16 slices\nThis is a cake that benefits from time. When the cake is cool wrap it up in plastic wrap and wait 24 hours to allow the flavors to intensify.\nIf you can't find candied ginger, you can simply substitute more fresh ginger.\nGINGERBREAD LOAF: A loaf pan can also be used for this recipe. Simply place foil over the top at 25 minutes, and then increase the continuing baking time by 5 to 10 minutes or until a toothpick comes out clean. I find, however, that a loaf pan often results in slightly crispier, more well-done crust.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter\n1/2 cup water\n1/2 cup molasses, unsulphured\n1/2 cup honey (preferably a dark variety such as buckwheat, avocado or wildflower)\n1/2 cup dark brown sugar (can substitute light brown)\n2 large eggs, room temperature\n1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated\n1 tablespoon candied ginger, minced\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda\n1 1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n1 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon ground cloves\n1/8 teaspoon nutmeg\nMETHOD\n1 Preheat oven, prep baking dish: Preheat oven to 325\xc2\xb0F. Butter and lightly flour an 8x8 or 9x9 baking dish. Fit a piece of parchment or baking paper inside and allow some to hang off the sides (this will make it easier to lift the cake out of the pan later). Lightly butter and flour the paper as well.\n2 Melt butter with molasses, honey, water, brown sugar: In a medium saucepan over medium heat place the butter, molasses, honey, water, and brown sugar. Stir to melt the butter. Do not allow to simmer or boil.\nOnce the butter is melted take the pot off the heat and allow to cool to room temperature. Be sure to stir the mixture every so often as the the sugar and fat will form skin on the surface.\n3 Add eggs, grated and candied ginger: Once the butter mixture is at room temperature whisk the eggs, grated ginger, and candied ginger into the molasses mixture. Set aside.\n4 Whisk flour, baking soda, and spices:  Whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, and nutmeg.\n5 Add the flour to the molasses mixture in three or four additions and whisk until it just comes together.\n6 Bake: Pour into the prepared pan and bake for 35 minutes. Loosely place a piece of foil over the top and bake for another 15 to 25 minutes or until a tester comes out clean.\n7 Cool: Cool on a wire rack for ten minutes, then lift the cake out of the pan and continue to cool on the rack.\nYou can serve this fresh out of the oven, but the flavor is much better if you give it a day to sit and allow the spices to intensify the cake.\nHello!

If so, apply sparingly so there is enough to cover the entire cake.\nFeel free to use any favorite liquor, such as Grand Marnier, Triple Sec, Cognac, Armagnac, Brandy or even Bourbon. Or, simply omit the liquor and use 2 tsp vanilla extract.\n  INGREDIENTS\nFor the cake:\n3 cups all-purpose flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder (make sure your baking powder is still fresh!)\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)\n3 large eggs\n2 cups granulated white sugar\n1 cup canola oil\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, with juice\n2 cups mashed bananas (from 3 to 5 bananas)\n1 cup finely chopped pecans\nFor the cream cheese frosting:\n1 pound cream cheese, softened\n1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened\n2 pounds (32-ounces) powdered sugar\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon Cointreau or other liquor (see Recipe Note)\n1 cup roughly chopped pecans, for topping (optional, toasted)\nEdible flowers for garnish (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\n3 9-inch cake pans\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0 F.

Stir the pineapple, bananas, vanilla and one cup of the chopped pecans into the egg mixture and mix (do not beat).\n4 Fold wet ingredients into dry: Using a wooden spoon or spatula, fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined (do not over-mix).\n5 Pour into cake pans and bake: Pour the batter into the three prepared cake pans, taking care to divide evenly. Bake at 350\xc2\xb0F on center racks of oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick or knife inserted in the center comes out clean.\n6 Cool: Allow the cakes to cool in the pan on wire racks for 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes, run a knife around the edges and remove the cakes from the pans.  Cool completely on wire racks before frosting.\n7 Make the frosting: Beat the softened butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer. With the mixer on low speed, add the powdered sugar in small amounts until all is incorporated, then add the Cointreau and vanilla and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy.\nNote: Do not add the powdered sugar while the mixer is set on a high speed, or you will create a snowy mess of sugar all over your kitchen. (Please do not ask me how I know this.)\n8 Frost the cake: Place one layer, top down, on a large plate or cake stand (this creates a smooth surface on the top and results in a more level cake). Spread frosting evenly over the first layer, then repeat with the second and third layers, then frost the sides.\n3 Sprinkle with chopped pecans: Sprinkle the top completely with the remaining cup of chopped pecans (toasted or un-toasted). Alternatively, press the chopped pecans onto the sides of the cake and leave the top simply frosted.\nThis cake is best served the day it's made and can be kept, assembled and frosted, for a few hours before servings. If you need to serve it the next day or if you have leftovers, cover the cake as well as possible and refrigerate it. Remove it from the fridge and let it come up to room temperature for an hour or two before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Using an electric mixer on medium speed, beat butter until creamy, 30-45 seconds. Add sugar and beat until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Scrape bowl with a rubber spatula occasionally as needed. Add eggs one at a time, beating 1 minute after each addition. Add the vanilla extract.\n5 Add dry ingredients and eggnog to butter sugar mixture. Remove the mixing bowl from the mixer and use a rubber spatula to gently add the dry ingredients in 4 additions, alternating with eggnog (begin and end with dry ingredients). Gently fold in orange zest, dried cranberries and any remaining brandy.\n6 Bake. Spoon the batter into the prepared bundt pan and spread evenly. Bake at 325\xc2\xb0F 55-60 minutes, or until cake springs back when touched lightly in the center and pulls away from the sides of the pan. You can also use a bamboo skewer and insert into the thickest part of the cake. If it comes out clean, it's done.\n7 Cool. Remove from oven and cool upright in the pan on a rack for 10 minutes. Invert cake onto a rack while the cake is still warm. Let cool completely.\n8 Prepare glaze. Once the cake has completely cooled, prepare glaze by whisking together powdered sugar, orange juice, and brandy. (You can sub the brandy with more orange juice or water if you want.)\nMake the glaze thick if you would like a thick, pronounced drizzle, or make it more thin if you want a glaze that is somewhat translucent.\n9 Glaze cake. Place cake on serving platter. Poke a few holes in the top and drizzle with brandy if you want. Use a spoon to stream the glaze onto the cake in back and forth motions to create a striped pattern. Or, if the glaze is thin enough, you can use a pastry brush to brush on the glaze.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Baking powder older than 6 months tends to go flat.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 3/4 cups (250 g) all purpose flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter, room temperature\n1 cup (8 ounces, 230 g) ricotta cheese, left to stand at room temperature for a few minutes to take the chill off\n1 1/2 cups sugar (300 g)\n3 large eggs, room temperature\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon lemon zest\n1 1/2 cups (140 g) blueberries\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 325\xc2\xb0F (160\xc2\xb0C). Prepare a 9x5-inch loaf pan, smearing the inside with butter.\n2 Whisk the dry ingredients: In a medium bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, baking powder and salt.\n2 Toss blueberries with flour: Rinse the blueberries and toss them with a little flour to lightly coat them (this will help keep them from sinking to the bottom of the cake).\n3 Mix wet ingredients and sugar for batter: Use an electric mixer (you can mix by hand but will get better results if you use an electric mixer) to beat together the butter, ricotta, and sugar, on high speed, for 3 minutes, until pale and fluffy.\nAdd the eggs one at a time, mixing on medium speed for one minute after each addition.\nMix in the lemon zest and vanilla extract. Don't worry if the batter looks a little curdled at this point. It isn't curdled; it just looks that way.\n4 Add dry ingredients, then blueberries: Remove the bowl from the mixer and stir in the dry ingredients in 3 or 4 additions, until just incorporated. Do not over mix. Stir in the blueberries.\n5 Pour the batter into the prepared loaf pan, smoothing out the top with a rubber spatula. Place on a baking sheet on the middle oven rack of the oven. (This will help moderate the temperature at the bottom of the pan.)\n6 Bake: Bake at 325\xc2\xb0F (160\xc2\xb0C) for 1 hour 10 minutes to 1 hour 20 minutes, or until a tester inserted into the center comes out mostly clean, or if you press on the center with your fingers and lift up, the cake surface gently bounces back.\nAfter the first 40 minutes of baking you may want to put a sheet of aluminum foil over the top of the pan to keep it from browning further.\n7 Cool: Remove from oven and let cool for 15 minutes in the pan. Then run a dull knife around the edge of the cake to make sure it is separated from the pan.\nGently remove the cake from the pan and let cool completely on a wire rack. Let cook completely before slicing.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"

Prepare a rack in the center of the oven. Place a baking sheet in a rack below it (to catch any drippings or spill-overs).\nGenerously butter the sides and bottom of a 9-inch or 10-inch springform pan. Add a few tablespoons of sugar and gently shake so that all the sides and bottom of the pan are coated with sugar. Tap out excess sugar.\n2 Beat egg yolks with sugar: Beat egg yolks with the granulated sugar until they are thick and pale yellow and form a ribbon when they fall from the beater, about 2 to 3 minutes on medium speed of an electric hand mixer.\n3 Melt chocolate: Make a double boiler by heating an inch of water to a bare simmer in a saucepan, and place a metal bowl on top of it. Make sure that the bottom of the metal bowl is not touching the water below.\nPlace chocolate and 4 Tbsp of water together in the top metal bowl of the double boiler.\nSlowly melt the chocolate over barely simmering water, whisking it until smooth. If the chocolate gets too thick, and looks like it will firm up, whisk in a tablespoon more of water.\nWhisk in a pinch of salt.\nLet cool until just warm to the touch.\n4 Make batter base: Slowly fold the warm chocolate into the egg mixture, gently stirring while you add the chocolate. Stir in the softened butter. Stir in the grated orange peel. Stir in the sifted flour. Mix thoroughly but gently.\n5 Incorporate beaten egg whites: Beat the egg whites until stiff. (See this wonderful explanation of whisking egg whites taken from La Bonne Cuisine de Madame Sant-Ange.)\nStir one third of the beaten egg whites in to the chocolate egg mixture to thin it. Gently fold in the remaining beaten egg whites, a third at a time until the egg whites are completely incorporated. Be careful at this stage not to over-mix.\n6 Bake: Pour the batter into your prepared springform pan. The batter will come close to the top of the pan. Set the pan on the middle rack of your oven and bake at 325\xc2\xb0F for 1 hour and 20 minutes, or until a cake tester comes out clean, or a digital thermometer inserted into the center reaches 200\xc2\xb0F (93\xc2\xb0C).\nDo not worry if the top of your baked chocolate cake has cracks in it! As the cake cools the top will settle and the cracks will close.\n7 Cool: Cool on a rack for 15 minutes, then remove the outer rim. Allow the cake to cool completely before removing the bottom of the pan. Refrigerate.\n8 When ready to serve, sprinkle with powdered sugar.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Cover and place in refrigerator until the tuna burgers are ready to be served.\n2 Make the tuna mix: In a small bowl, use a fork to combine the egg and mayonnaise. Add the tuna and stir to combine. In a separate, medium bowl combine panko, garlic, corn, carrot, red pepper, yellow onion, and Creole seasoning.\nAdd the mayonnaise and tuna mixture to the panko mixture. Stir until well combined.\n3 Shape the patties: Use a 1/3 cup measuring cup to measure out a heaping scoop of tuna mixture and form into 6 patties.\n4 Cook the patties in the oven or on the stovetop:\nTo make in the oven: Place a large cast iron skillet in your oven, then preheat the oven to 375\xc2\xb0F. When it reaches the desired temperature, remove skillet from the oven with oven mitts. You want the skillet good and hot, which will help sear the burgers.\nSpray the inside of the skillet and both sides of the tuna burgers with cooking spray; it helps mimic that crisp edge you get when you actually fry something. Add the burgers to the skillet and return it to the oven. Bake for about 7 minutes or until the bottoms of the burgers are golden brown and crispy.\nFlip the burgers and cook until the other side is golden. This should take about 7 to 9 additional minutes.\nTo make this on the stovetop: Heat 3 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the tuna burgers to the skillet and cook on each side for about 3 to 4 minutes, until the surface is golden brown and crispy. Drain on a paper towel.\nServe on toasted hamburger buns with the dill olive mayonnaise, sliced red onion, and lettuce.\nMake-ahead instructions: Feel free to shape the patties up to 24 hours in advance. Cover with plastic wrap and keep in the fridge until ready to use. Reheat previously cooked patties by heating a teaspoon of oil in a pan over medium heat. When the oil begins to shimmer, add the patties. Flip them once and cook until they are warmed through\xe2\x80\x94about 5 minutes.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nHow To Make Fast, No-Soak Beans in the Instant Pot\nCook time: 30 minutesYield: about 5 cups cooked beans\nDon\'t skip the olive oil. This helps reduce foam during cooking, which could clog the pressure valve on the pressure cooker.\nIf cooking red kidney beans, I recommend boiling the beans for about 10 minutes first to break down the lectins.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound dried beans (see below for cooking times for specific beans)\n8 cups water\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 to 2 teaspoons salt\n2 o 3 cloves peeled garlic, optional\n1 bay leaf, optional\nSpecial equipment:\n6- to 8-quart pressure cooker (I use a 6-quart Instant Pot)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Combine all ingredients in the pressure cooker. Do not fill the pressure cooker more than half full.\n2 Secure the lid. Make sure the pressure regulator valve is closed. (On an Instant Pot, this means it will be set to the the "sealing" position.)\n3 Cook the beans: Here are the cooking times for unsoaked beans in the Instant Pot. Cooking times will be similar for other electric pressure cookers; cooking time will be slightly less for stovetop pressure cookers. Double-check the manual that came with your pressure cooker for more exact cooking times:\nBlack beans: 20 to 25 minutes\nBlack-eyed peas : 20 to 25 minutes\nGreat Northern beans: 25 to 30 minutes\nNavy beans: 25 to 30 minutes\nPinto beans: 25 to 30 minutes\nCannellini beans: 35 to 40 minutes\nChickpeas (garbanzo beans): 35 to 40 minutes\nRed kidney beans: 25-30 minutes (boil for 10 minutes before pressure cooking)\nCook beans at high pressure for the time recommended above. The pressure cooker will take 15 to 20 minutes to come to full pressure before cooking begins.\n4 Let the pressure release: Once cooking is complete, you can let the pressure release naturally on its own, which takes about 20 to 30 minutes, or you can do a "quick release" by opening the pressure valve on the top of the pressure cooker. If doing a rapid release, be careful because the bean liquid sometimes foams into the valve.\nI recommend letting the pressure release naturally for as long as you\'re able before the beans are needed. This helps the beans retain their shape and avoids the bean liquid foaming.\nWhat to do if your beans aren\'t quite done: Put the lid back on the pressure cooker and make sure the release valve is set back to "sealing." Cook at high pressure for another 5 to 10 minutes (depending on if you think your beans need just a little more time or a little more time to finish). The pot will quickly come back up to pressure because the contents are already hot. Check your beans after the extra cooking time and continue cooking for longer if needed.\n5 Using and storing your beans: The beans can be strained and used right away, or cooled and stored in their cooking liquid. They will keep for up to a week refrigerated or up to 3 months in the freezer.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nEasy Tuscan Bean Soup Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 4 servings\nIf eating gluten-free, use gluten-free bread for the Parmesan toasts, or replace the toasts with another gluten-free side dish.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the soup:\n3 tablespoons olive oil\n2 medium carrots, thickly sliced\n1 large onion, coarsely chopped\n1 stalk celery, coarsely chopped\n1 clove garlic, finely chopped\n3 sprigs fresh oregano\n1/4 teaspoon salt\nBlack pepper, to taste\n2 (15 -ounce) cans cannellini beans or other small white beans, drained and rinsed\n5 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock\n4 cups baby kale or baby spinach, stems removed if tough\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano, for garnish\nOlive oil, to serve\nExtra grated Parmesan, to serve\nFor the parmesan toasts:\n1/2 baguette, thinly sliced\nOlive oil\n1/2 cup grated Parmesan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the vegetables: In a soup pot, heat the olive oil. When it is hot, add the carrots, onion, celery, garlic, fresh oregano sprigs, salt, and pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 10 minutes until the vegetables look softened and the onions turn translucent.\n2 Prepare the beans: On a plate, mash 1/2 cup of the beans with a fork or potato masher. Add them to the vegetables in the pot. Cook, stirring, for 2 minutes.\n3 Simmer the soup: Add the remaining beans to the pot and stir well. Stir in the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, partially cover with the lid placed askew, and simmer for 20 minutes, or until the carrots are tender and the liquid is flavorful.\nDiscard the oregano sprigs; the leaves will have fallen into the soup. Add additional salt and pepper to taste.\n4 While the soup simmers, make the Parmesan toasts: Toast the bread until lightly golden on both sides. While the toast is still hot from the toaster, sprinkle with olive oil and cheese. If you have a toaster oven, return them to the toaster for 1 minute to melt the cheese; otherwise, arrange the toasts in a skillet over medium heat, cover, and warm for about 1 minute or until the cheese has melted.\n5 Add the greens to the soup: Add the kale or spinach to the pot and simmering for another 2 minutes, or just until the greens wilt.\n 6 Serve the soup: Ladle the soup into bowls, sprinkle with oregano and more olive oil, if you like. Serve with Parmesan toasts and extra Parmesan for sprinkling.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Use 3 or 4 15-ounce cans, drained and rinsed and proceed to step 3. If you want a vegetarian version, skip the bacon, increase the olive oil, and use vegetable stock.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound dry cannellini, borlotti or Great Northern beans\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n1/4 pound bacon or pancetta, roughly chopped\n1/2 medium onion, chopped\n4 garlic cloves, chopped\n1 tablespoon fresh sage, minced (can sub fresh rosemary)\n1/2 to 1 teaspoon chile flakes (depending on how spicy you want it)\n2 tablespoons honey\n1/4 cup tomato paste\n1 15-ounce can crushed tomatoes or tomato sauce\n2 cups beef or chicken stock (use gluten-free stock for gluten-free version)\nSalt\n1/2 cup chopped fresh parsley\n2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Soak the beans in water: Pre-soak the beans, either by covering with two inches of water and soaking overnight, or by pouring boiling water over them and soaking them for an hour.\n2 Drain beans, cover with water, cook until tender: Drain the beans and put them in a medium-sized pot and cover with 2 inches of water. Bring to a simmer, cover, reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook until the beans are just soft enough to eat, about 1 hour, give or take 15 minutes or so, depending on how old the beans are (older beans will take longer to cook).\n3 Cook bacon or pancetta: Preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xb0F. In a 3 or 4 quart heavy-bottomed, oven-proof, lidded pot such as a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until lightly browned and crispy.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions: Add the chopped onions and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring often, until the onions begin to brown.

b"Save It Print\nBread and Butter Pickles Recipe\nPrep time: 4 hours, 20 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Makes about 5 pint jars\nStart with the freshest pickling cucumbers you can find; your pickles are only going to be as good as the produce you start with. The fresher the cucumbers are, the crispier your pickles will be.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 1/2 lbs pickling cucumbers (fresh from the market)\n1/4 cup pickling salt (can use Kosher salt as a substitute, regular table salt has additives in it that will turn the pickles dark and muddy the color of the pickle juice)\n1 pound white or yellow onions, thinly sliced\n1 1/4 cup white distilled vinegar (5% acidity)\n1 cup apple cider vinegar (5% acidity)\n2 1/4 cups sugar\nPickling spices:\n1 tablespoon mustard seeds\n1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes\n3/4 teaspoon celery seeds\n1 inch cinnamon stick\n6 allspice berries plus a pinch of ground allspice\n6 whole cloves plus a pinch of ground cloves\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric\nSpecial equipment:\nIf you are planning to store pickles outside of refrigerator, you will need the following canning equipment:\n5 pint-sized canning jars, clean, unused lids, metal screw bands for the lids (see Canning jars and lids)\n1 16-qt canning pot with rack\nJar lifters or tongs\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Rinse and slice the cucumbers: Carefully rinse the cucumbers, scrubbing away any dirt that may have stuck to the ribs. Slice off 1/8-inch from the ends and discard. Slice the cucumbers in 1/4-inch thick slices, place in a large bowl.\n2 Salt, chill, and drain the cucumber slices: Add the sliced onions and all of the pickling salt. Stir in so that the salt is well distributed among the cucumber slices. Cover with a clean tea towel (thin towel, not terry cloth). Cover with a couple of inches of ice.\nPut in the refrigerator and let chill for 4 hours. Discard ice. Rinse the cucumber and onion slices thoroughly, drain. Rinse and drain again.\n3 Sterilize the jars: If you are planning to store your pickles outside of the refrigerator for any length of time, you will need to sterilize your jars before canning, and heat the filled jars in a hot water bath after canning.\nIf you are planning to eat the pickles right away and store them the whole time in the refrigerator, you can skip the water bath step. It's still a good idea to sterilize the jars first, you can do that by running them through the dishwasher, or placing them in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 minutes.\nTo sterilize the jars for canning, place empty jars on a metal rack in a large, 16-qt canning pot. (Jars must rest on a rack in the pot, not on the bottom of the pot). Fill with warm water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to warm to keep the jars hot and ready for canning.\nRemove with tongs or jar lifters one by one as you can the cucumbers.\nSterilize the lids by bringing a pot of water to a boil and pouring water over a bowl containing the lids.\n4 Make pickling syrup: In a 4 qt or 6 qt pot, place the vinegar, sugar, and all of the pickling spices. (Do NOT add salt.) Bring to a boil. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the sliced cucumbers and onions. Bring to a boil again. As soon as the sugar vinegar solution begins boiling again, use a slotted spoon to start packing the hot jars with the cucumbers and onions.\n5 Pack jars, add pickling syrup: Pack jars to an inch from the rim with the cucumbers and onions. Then pour hot vinegar sugar syrup over them to a half inch from the rim.\nWipe the rim clean with a paper towel. Place a sterilized lid on the jar. Secure with a metal screw band.\n6 Process in hot water bath: If you are planning to store pickles outside of refrigerator, you will want to process the filled jars in a hot water bath.\nReturn filled jars to the same canning pot with its already hot water. Water level needs to be at least one inch above the top of the cans.\nBring to a boil and let boil hard for 15 minutes, or 20 minutes for altitudes of 1001 to 6,000 feet. Over 6,000 feet, boil for 25 minutes. Remove jars from pot.\nLet cool down to room temperature. Jars should make a popping sound as their lids seal. If a lid doesn't properly seal, do not store the jar outside of the refrigerator.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nCanned Tomato Salsa Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: Makes about 5 pints\nBefore starting, prepare your workspace so that it is clean and uncluttered. If you don\'t want to roast your own green chiles, you can sub with about two 7-ounce cans of green chiles, chopped.\nThis recipe uses specific amounts of ingredients, balancing the non-acidic ingredients with the amount of added acid needed to make the recipe safe. Do not increase the amount of green chiles beyond 1 1/2 cups, or decrease the amount of tomatoes less than 7 cups.\nINGREDIENTS\n5 pounds of tomatoes\n1 pound large Anaheim green chiles (5-6 chiles)\n3 jalape\xc3\xb1o chilies, seeded and stems removed, chopped\n1 1/2 cups chopped onion\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 cup apple cider vinegar\n1/2 cup loosely packed fresh chopped cilantro (including stems)\n2 teaspoons dried oregano\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n2 teaspoons salt\n1 to 2 tablespoons sugar or more (to taste, depending on how sweet your tomatoes are)\nSpecial equipment:\n5 to 6 pint-sized canning jars, with rings and new lids\nA very large stockpot or canning pot (16-qt)\nA flat steamer rack on which to place the filled jar for the water bath canning, so that they don\'t touch the bottom of the pan and crack from excess heat\nOptional but recommended:\nJar lifter canning tongs to make it easy to lift the jars in and out of boiling water\nRubber or latex coated gardening gloves to make it easier on your hands for handling hot jars\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Sterilize jars and lids in water bath: Place steamer rack in the bottom of a large (16-qt) stock pot or canning pot. Place new or clean mason jars on the rack. Fill the jars with water and fill the pot with just enough water to come to the top of the jars. Heat water to a simmer. Simmer for 10 minutes. (Keep the jars warm while preparing the salsa.)\nHave a kettle half filled with water ready to boil, to use to sterilize the jar lids a few minutes before canning.\n2 Roast chile peppers: Roast the Anaheim green chile peppers until blackened all over. The best way to do this is directly over a gas flame on the stovetop (see how to roast chiles over a gas flame.) If you don\'t have a gas cooktop you can broil the chiles, or blister them on a grill.\nNote that it is not essential that the chile peppers be cooked through, only that the outer tough skin is blistered and blackened. This is what will help with flavor. Also it will make it easy to peel the chiles.\nJust put the chiles near a heat source until blistered and blackened, and turn them so that they get blackened on all sides.\nThen place the chiles in a brown paper bag (or in a covered bowl), close the bag and let the chiles steam in their own heat for a few minutes.\nThen gently rub off the outer skin and discard. Cut away the stems and remove the seeds and any prominent veins.\nChop up the chiles and set aside; you should have 1 cup of chopped chiles. Do not use more than 1 1/2 cups of chopped chiles.\n3 Prepare the tomatoes: You want the tomatoes peeled, and there are several ways of doing that. Blanching them is easiest; grilling or broiling will result in more flavor.\nTo blanch them, score the ends of the tomatoes and place them in boiling water for a minute.\nIf you are going to grill or broil the tomatoes, I recommend coring them first. Grilling is best with whole plum tomatoes; grill them on high direct heat until blackened in parts and the peels are cracked.\nBroiling works with any sized tomato. Just cut them in half and place the cut side down on a rimmed baking sheet or roasting pan. Broil until the peels are blackened in parts.\nRemove the tomatoes (from water, grill or broiler) and let cool to the touch. Remove and discard the peels. Cut away any cores if you haven\'t done so already. Chop the tomatoes taking care to save any juices that may come out of them.\nStarting with 5 pounds of tomatoes you should end up with about 8 cups of chopped tomatoes and juices. (You must use at least 7 cups of tomatoes.) Place them in a bowl and set aside.\n4 Simmer all ingredients in a large pot: Put all of the ingredients into a large (8-qt) stainless steel pot. (Do not use aluminum or the acidity of the sauce will cause the aluminum to leach into the sauce.)\nBring to a boil, reduce to a simmer. Cook uncovered for about 10 minutes.\n5 Sterilize jar lids: While the salsa is cooking, place the jar lids in a bowl and cover with boiling water to sterilize.\n6 Blend salsa if you want it to be more smooth: If you want your salsa to be more smooth than chunky, use an immersion blender to pulse it a few times, or working in batches ladle about half of it into a blender and pur\xc3\xa9e.\n7 Adjust seasonings: If too acidic to taste, add more sugar to balance the vinegar! If too sweet, add a bit more vinegar.\n8 Ladle salsa into canning jars and seal: Ladle salsa into canning jars, leaving 1/2-inch head space. Wipe the rims with a clean, dampened paper towel so that there is no residual food on the rims.\nPlace canning lids on the jars. Screw on the lid rings. Do not over-tighten or you may not get a good seal. Air does need to escape from the jars during the next step, the water bath.\n9 Boil in a water bath: Place the filled and lidded jars back onto the rack in the large stock-pot of hot water you used to sterilize the jars in step one. You may need to remove some of the water from the pot to prevent it from overfilling.\nCover the jars with at least 1-inch of water. Bring to a rolling boil and process for 15 minutes (20 minutes for altitudes 1000 to 6000 ft, 25 minutes above 6000 ft). Then turn off heat and let the jars sit in the hot water for 5 minutes.\n10 Let jars cool, lids should pop: Remove jars from the water bath and let sit on a counter for several hours until completely cool. The lids should "pop" as the cooling salsa creates a vacuum under the lid and the jars are sealed.\nIf a lid has not sealed, either replace the lid and reprocess in a water bath for another 15 minutes, or store in the refrigerator and use within the next few days.\nRemember to label the cans with the date processed. (I use a Sharpie on the lid.) Canned salsa should be eaten within a year.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

They\'ll need to pickle for 2 to 3 days in the fridge before they\'re ready.\nAs is, the recipe makes a fairly sweet pickle. You can cut the sugar in half for a more sour and tart pickle, if desired.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Kirby or other small cucumbers\n1 small sweet yellow onion\n1 cup apple cider vinegar\n1 cup water\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon kosher salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons pickling spice, homemade or store-bought\nSpecial equipment:\n2 wide-mouth pint canning jars\nCanning jar lids, plastic or metal\nMandoline, or sharp knife\nCanning funnel (helpful, but not essential)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Wash and dry the jars and cucumbers: Wash 2 wide-mouth pint jars and their lids in hot, soapy water. Set them aside to dry.\nRinse the cucumbers well under cold water, pat them dry, and then set them on a towel to dry completely.\n2 Slice the cucumbers and onion, then pack them in the jars: With a sharp knife or a mandoline slicer, slice the cucumbers and onion into slices 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick.\nFirmly pack the cucumbers and onions into the jars, fitting in as many as you can without smashing the vegetables. Leave 1/2-inch or so of headspace at the top of the jars.\n3 Make the brine: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and pickling spice up to a simmer. Stir occasionally and continue simmering until the sugar and salt are dissolved.\n4 Pour the brine over the vegetables: If you have a canning funnel, use it here to make it easier to fill the jars. Carefully pour or ladle the hot brine into each jar, filling the jars until the cucumbers and onions are covered. It\'s ok if a few small pieces poke out the top.\n5 Cool and refrigerate for 24 hours: Screw on the lids, then let the jars cool to room temperature (about an hour). The cucumbers will start off bright green, but will become darker and more "pickle-colored" as they cool.\nPlace them in the refrigerator. Wait at least 24 hours before eating the pickles in order to let the flavors develop. Use them within one month.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

The fresher the cucumbers are, the crispier your pickles will be.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 1/2 lbs pickling cucumbers (fresh from the market)\n1/4 cup pickling salt (can use Kosher salt as a substitute, regular table salt has additives in it that will turn the pickles dark and muddy the color of the pickle juice)\n1 pound white or yellow onions, thinly sliced\n1 1/4 cup white distilled vinegar (5% acidity)\n1 cup apple cider vinegar (5% acidity)\n2 1/4 cups sugar\nPickling spices:\n1 tablespoon mustard seeds\n1 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes\n3/4 teaspoon celery seeds\n1 inch cinnamon stick\n6 allspice berries plus a pinch of ground allspice\n6 whole cloves plus a pinch of ground cloves\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric\nSpecial equipment:\nIf you are planning to store pickles outside of refrigerator, you will need the following canning equipment:\n5 pint-sized canning jars, clean, unused lids, metal screw bands for the lids (see Canning jars and lids)\n1 16-qt canning pot with rack\nJar lifters or tongs\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Rinse and slice the cucumbers: Carefully rinse the cucumbers, scrubbing away any dirt that may have stuck to the ribs. Slice off 1/8-inch from the ends and discard. Slice the cucumbers in 1/4-inch thick slices, place in a large bowl.\n2 Salt, chill, and drain the cucumber slices: Add the sliced onions and all of the pickling salt. Stir in so that the salt is well distributed among the cucumber slices. Cover with a clean tea towel (thin towel, not terry cloth). Cover with a couple of inches of ice.\nPut in the refrigerator and let chill for 4 hours. Discard ice. Rinse the cucumber and onion slices thoroughly, drain. Rinse and drain again.\n3 Sterilize the jars: If you are planning to store your pickles outside of the refrigerator for any length of time, you will need to sterilize your jars before canning, and heat the filled jars in a hot water bath after canning.\nIf you are planning to eat the pickles right away and store them the whole time in the refrigerator, you can skip the water bath step. It's still a good idea to sterilize the jars first, you can do that by running them through the dishwasher, or placing them in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 minutes.\nTo sterilize the jars for canning, place empty jars on a metal rack in a large, 16-qt canning pot. (Jars must rest on a rack in the pot, not on the bottom of the pot). Fill with warm water and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to warm to keep the jars hot and ready for canning.\nRemove with tongs or jar lifters one by one as you can the cucumbers.\nSterilize the lids by bringing a pot of water to a boil and pouring water over a bowl containing the lids.\n4 Make pickling syrup: In a 4 qt or 6 qt pot, place the vinegar, sugar, and all of the pickling spices. (Do NOT add salt.) Bring to a boil. Once the sugar has dissolved, add the sliced cucumbers and onions. Bring to a boil again. As soon as the sugar vinegar solution begins boiling again, use a slotted spoon to start packing the hot jars with the cucumbers and onions.\n5 Pack jars, add pickling syrup: Pack jars to an inch from the rim with the cucumbers and onions. Then pour hot vinegar sugar syrup over them to a half inch from the rim.\nWipe the rim clean with a paper towel. Place a sterilized lid on the jar. Secure with a metal screw band.\n6 Process in hot water bath: If you are planning to store pickles outside of refrigerator, you will want to process the filled jars in a hot water bath.\nReturn filled jars to the same canning pot with its already hot water. Water level needs to be at least one inch above the top of the cans.\nBring to a boil and let boil hard for 15 minutes, or 20 minutes for altitudes of 1001 to 6,000 feet. Over 6,000 feet, boil for 25 minutes. Remove jars from pot.\nLet cool down to room temperature. Jars should make a popping sound as their lids seal.

b'Print\nMeyer Lemon Marmalade Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hourCook time: 1 hourYield: Makes 6-8 half-pint (8-ounce) jars\nThis recipe calls for Meyer lemons, a hybrid of a regular lemon and an orange, that is thinner skinned and sweeter than a regular lemon. You cannot substitute regular lemons for Meyer lemons in this recipe.\nThe proportion of lemon segments to water to sugar is 1:1:1. So if you don\'t have a kitchen scale and don\'t weigh your lemons to begin with, as you proceed through this recipe keep in mind these proportions. Your 2 1/2 lbs of lemons should yield 6 cups of chopped lemon. 6 cups of chopped lemon will be cooked first with 6 cups of water, and then later 6 cups of sugar are added.\nYou can also do this recipe with 4 cups of chopped lemons, 4 cups of water, and 4 cups of sugar. Do not double the recipe.\nDo not reduce the sugar (if you want a reduced sugar recipe, use a different recipe); the sugar is needed for the jelly to set.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 1/2 lbs of Meyer lemons (about 9 lemons)\n6 cups water\n6 cups granulated sugar\nSpecial equipment:\n1 wide 6 or 8-quart pan (Stainless steel or copper with stainless steel lining, not aluminum which will leach)\nA sharp chef\'s knife\nA candy thermometer or instant-read thermometer (I use a thermapen or thermopop)\n6 half-pint (8-oz) canning jars\nCheesecloth, enough to double over and form a bag to hold the seeds for making pectin, or a Muslin jelly bag\nAdditional Equipment Recommended:\nFlexible plastic cutting board surface (to curl up to catch the lemon juice from the lemons to add to the fruit)\nDisposable latex or non-latex gloves to protect your hands from the acid from the lemons\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nPREPARING THE FRUIT\n1 Scrub the lemons clean. Discard any that are moldy or damaged.\n2 Prepare the lemons: Cut 1/4 inch off from the ends of the lemons. Working one at a time, stand a lemon on end. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise. Cut each lemon half into several segments, lengthwise.\nAs you cut the lemons into segments, if you can, pull off any exposed membranes. Just get the ones that are easy to get to, ignore the rest. When you\'ve cut down to the final segment, cut away the pithy core. Remove all seeds from the segments. Reserve the seeds and any removed membrane or pith. You will need them to make pectin.\nCut each lemon segment crosswise into even pieces to make little triangles of lemon peel and pulp.\n3 Put seeds, membranes, pith into cheesecloth or muslin bag: Put all of the seeds, membranes and pith you removed from the lemons into a bag fashioned out of two layers of cheesecloth or a muslin jelly bag.\n  FIRST STAGE OF COOKING\n4 Place the lemon segments and water into a large, wide pot.\n5 Secure pectin bag: Place the pectin bag in the pot with the fruit pulp and secure to the pot handle.\n6 Boil until peels are soft: Bring mixture to a strong boil on high heat. Let boil, uncovered, for about 25-35 minutes, until the peels are soft and cooked through. (If too much of the water evaporates from the boil and the peels start sticking to the bottom of the pan, add a little more water back in.)\nTest one of the lemon peel pieces by eating it. It should be very soft. If it is still chewy, keep cooking until soft.\nRemove from heat.\n7 Remove the pectin bag, place the pectin bag in a bowl and let cool until it is comfortable to touch.\nADD THE PECTIN AND SUGAR\n8 Squeeze pectin from pectin bag: Once your pectin bag has cooled to the point you can handle it, if you want, squeeze it like play-doh to extract any extra pectin. This is not necessary but will help ensure a good set. (I like to wear latex-type gloves for this part.) You should be able to get a teaspoon or two more from the bag. It has the consistency of sour cream. Return this pectin to the pan with the lemon mixture.\n9 Add sugar: Measure out your sugar and add it to the pan with the lemon mixture.\n  SECOND STAGE OF COOKING\n10 Boil and check temperature: Heat the jelly mixture on medium high and bring it to a rapid boil, stirring occasionally, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan.\nAfter the jelly first comes to a boil, it will foam up considerably. this is why you need need to use a large pot, and make sure you pay attention and keep your eyes on the whole process. Stir with a wooden spoon to bring the foam back down. If it gets too high, lower the temperature to keep it from overflowing the pot.\nSecure a candy thermometer to the side of the pan, or check the jelly temperature with an instant read thermometer. The marmalade may take anywhere from 20 to 35 minutes or so to be ready to pour out. After about 15 minutes, start checking the temperature frequently.\n11 Test to see if the marmalade is at set point: There are two ways to test that the marmalade is ready to pour out into jars: the mixture reaching a temperature of 218-220\xc2\xb0F (6-8\xc2\xb0F above the boiling point at your altitude) OR putting a bit of it on a chilled plate "wrinkling up" when you push it with your finger tip. I steer off of the wrinkle test. If the sample of jelly wrinkles, it\'s ready. I use a thermometer just to help me gauge when to do the wrinkle test.\nFor the wrinkle test, place a small plate into the freezer. As the jelly temperature reaches 217\xc2\xb0F, start testing it by placing a small amount of the hot jelly on the chilled plate. If the jelly spreads out and thins immediately, it isn\'t ready. If it holds its shape a bit, like an egg yolk, that\'s a good sign. Push up against it with your finger tip. If the jelly sample wrinkles at all, it is time to take the jelly off the heat and pour it out into jars.\nWhen you use a candy thermometer or an insta-read thermometer to test the temperature of your mixture, make sure the probe is NOT touching the bottom of the pan. Make sure that the indentation on the probe (with modern candy thermometers this is about an inch and a half from the bottom of the probe) is actually surrounded by the mixture. This may mean that you have to tilt the pan to one side, to cover the probe sufficiently to get a good reading.\n  CANNING\n12 Sterilize canning jars: While the marmalade is in its second cooking stage, rinse out your canning jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven. They should be in the oven at least 10 minutes before using them. This not only sterilizes the jars, but it helps to keep them from cracking from the temperature differential when you add the hot jelly mixture to them.\n13 Sterilize lids: As the time approaches for the marmalade to be done, boil some water in a tea pot. Put the jar lids in a glass or ceramic bowl and pour the boiling water over them to sterilize.\n14 Ladle marmalade into sterilized jars: Once the jelly has reached 218-220\xc2\xb0F or its "wrinkly" stage, remove the jelly pot from the heat. Carefully ladle the jelly into the jars, leaving 1/4 inch head space at the top of the jars for a vacuum seal.\n15 Clean rims, secure with lids and jar ring: Wipe the rim clean with a clean, wet paper towel. Place the lid on the jar, securing with a jar ring. Work quickly.\n16 Allow jars to cool and seal: Allow the jars to sit overnight. You will hear them make a popping sound as a vacuum seal is created.\nEven if the jelly is not firm as it goes into the jar (it shouldn\'t be), it should firm up as it cools.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nPomegranate Jelly Recipe\nYield: Makes 6 to 7 eight-ounce jars\nThe process of canning jelly is specific to what fruit you are canning, the type of pectin you are using - whether natural, liquid, powder - and the ratio of juice to sugar to pectin.\nIf you plan to store your jelly on a shelf, and not in the refrigerator, you need special canning equipment to ensure against spoilage.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 cups pomegranate juice\n1/4 cup lemon juice\n1 package SureJell powdered pectin*\n5 cups white cane sugar\n*If using MCP pectin, use 3 cups of pomegranate juice, 4 cups sugar, 1/4 cup lemon juice for one package of pectin\nSpecial equipment:\n6-7 Eight ounce canning jars\nFine mesh strainer\nSteaming rack for water bath\nMETHOD\n1 Make the Juice: There are two basic ways to make pomegranate juice from fresh pomegranates.\nThe first way is to cut open a pomegranate and submerge it in a large bowl filled with water. Remove the seeds underwater; they will sink to the bottom while the white membrane holding them together will float. Discard the peel and membranes.\nStrain the seeds and put them in a blender. Cover the blender. Pulse the blender only a few times so that the seeds are broken up. Place a mesh strainer over a bowl and pour the seed mixture through the strainer. Use a rubber spatula to help press the pulp against the strainer as to extract as much juice as possible.\nThe second way to juice a pomegranate is to use a juice press. I have an old fashioned press that I use. I wash the pomegranate and cut it into quarters or halves, depending on how big the pomegranate is.\nI then crush the sections with a press and strain the juice through a mesh strainer. I have found that this method takes half the time or less of the first method, but the flavor can be a little more bitter because you are squeezing the peel as well.\n2 Prepare canning jars: Seep the clean, empty canning jars in boiling water for several minutes. Boil a few cups of water in a separate kettle and pour over the lids in a small bowl to sterilize.\n3 Bring pomegranate juice, lemon juice, and pectin to a rolling boil: Measure pomegranate juice and lemon juice in a 6-quart pan. Add pectin, stir and place over high heat. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly to prevent scorching.\n4 Add sugar: When you reach a full rolling boil that cannot be stirred down, and add sugar. Return to a boil and boil hard for exactly 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Let stand for a minute and skim off foam.\n5 Fill jars: Fill jars to 1/2" of the top. Wipe rims clean. Screw on 2-piece lids.\n6 Water bath:  It helps to take this step if you plan to keep the jelly unrefrigerated. A water bath will give you a tighter seal.\nPlace the jelly jars, not touching, on a rack in a tall pot of boiling water. The water should cover the top of the jars by at least an inch. Boil for 5 minutes and then remove from the water.\nLet the jars cool. Check seals, the lids should be sucked down (you\'ll hear a popping noise as the jelly cools).\nOnce the jars reach room temperature, put them in the refrigerator for a few hours to complete the jellying. Lasts about 3 weeks once opened.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'
b'Save It Print\nSeville Orange Marmalade Recipe\nYield: Makes 5-6 8-ounce jars\nIt\'s best to make just one batch at a time of this marmalade. I do not recommend experimenting with a double batch until you are comfortable making single batches.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 pounds (1.36 kg) of seville or bitter oranges (6 to 12 oranges, depending on the size of the oranges)\n6 to 8 cups water\n2 lemons - 1 regular lemon and 1 Meyer lemon\n5 to 6 cups white granulated sugar (or more to taste)\nSpecial equipment:\n1 wide 6 to 8-quart pan (stainless steel or copper with stainless steel lining, do not use aluminum which will leach, hard anodized aluminum is okay)\nA citrus juicer (an electric one will make the process easier, but you can use a hand juicer)\nA sharp chef\'s knife\nAn instant read digital thermometer or a candy thermometer\nA large (8 cup) measuring cup pourer\n6 to 8 8-oz canning jars\nA muslin jelly bag (for the pectin), or a large (18" diameter) round piece of muslin, or several pieces of cheesecloth that you can tie up into a bag\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nPREPARING THE FRUIT\n1 Scrub the oranges clean. Discard any that are damaged or soft.\n2 Cut the oranges in half and juice them. As you juice the oranges, save the seeds. Put the seeds into a separate bowl and set them aside. You will use the seeds to make natural pectin for the marmalade\n3 Cut the peels into narrow strips: Taking a clean juiced orange half rind, use a spoon to dig out segment membranes still attached to the inside. Put a few of these in with the seeds (segment membranes will also provide pectin).\nUse a sharp chef\'s knife to thinly julienne the peel. Once you julienne all of the oranges put the cut peels and the juice in a large (8-cup Pyrex works great) measuring cup.\n4 Juice the regular lemon and add this juice to the orange peels and juice. Save the seeds for making pectin.\n5 Prep the Meyer lemon: Cut the Meyer lemon in eighths, lengthwise. Remove the seeds and as much of the inner membranes as you can easily remove. Cut the lemon segments crosswise into triangular pieces. (See the steps in the Meyer lemon marmalade recipe for photo descriptions.)\nAdd the cut Meyer lemon to the measuring cup with the oranges.\nAdd the Meyer lemon seeds to the Seville orange seeds and membranes.\nYou should have 5 to 6 cups combined, of citrus peels and juices.\n6 Put seeds into cheesecloth or muslin bag: Put the citrus seeds and membranes into 4 layers of cheesecloth, tied up tightly with string, or into a muslin jelly bag. (I made a "pectin bag" which I use for making marmalade, by sewing up piece of plain muslin cloth into a bag with a drawstring at the end.)\nFIRST STAGE OF COOKING\n1 Put orange mixture into pot, add water: Place the orange and lemon juices and cut peels into a large, wide (6 to 8-quart) thick-bottomed pot.\nAdd 6 cups of water. (At this point you can soak overnight if you want. It will help the peels cook faster.)\n2 Secure pectin bag: Place the cheesecloth or muslin bag containing the citrus seeds and pulp into the pot, submerging it in the liquid, and secure the string at the other end to the pot handle.\nAs the mixture cooks, the pectin from the seeds and membranes will be extracted into the mixture.\n3 Boil until the peels are soft: Bring mixture to a boil. Let boil, uncovered, for 30 minutes (or longer), or until the peels are completely soft and cooked through.\nDepending on your particular fruit, it may take more time, and more water, to get to the point where the peels are soft. Once you add sugar to the mixture in the next step, the peels will firm up with the sugar, so it\'s very important that the peels in this first stage of cooking are completely soft.\nTest the orange peels as you go. Take a bite, if the peel is at all firm to the bite, it needs more cooking.\nIf the water has boiled down and the mixture starts to stick to the bottom of the pot, add more water, a cup at a time.\nWhen the peels are soft, remove from heat.\n4 Remove the pectin bag and place it in a bowl to let cool until it is comfortable to touch.\nMEASURE THE FRUIT AND ADD SUGAR AND PECTIN\n1 Measure the mixture: Pour out the mixture from the pot into a large measuring cup. Measure how much of the mixture you have. Depending on how hard of a boil and how long the cooking time, you could have anywhere from 4 to 5 cups. Return the mixture back to the pan.\n2 Add sugar: Add to the mixture 7/8 cup of sugar for every cup of mixture. So, if you measured 4 cups of mixture, add in 3 1/2 cups of sugar. Once the sugar has dissolved, taste the mixture. Add more sugar depending on how sweet you want your marmalade to be.\nNote that the jelly mixture will reduce further, intensifying both the flavor and the sweetness of the jelly. I typically use 4 cups of sugar for every 4 cups of fruit mixture, which produces a rather tart marmalade. Feel free to use more!\n3 Squeeze pectin from pectin bag: Once your pectin bag has cooled to the point you can handle it, squeeze it like play-doh to extract extra pectin. Grasp a tangerine size portion of the bag and squeeze, pulling the bag away from you with one hand as you hold firmly with the other hand. Work your way around the bag.\n"Milk" the pectin until you have released about a tablespoon of pectin. The pectin has the consistency of sour cream. Add it to the orange mixture.\nSECOND STAGE OF COOKING\n1 Boil and check temperature: Heat the jelly mixture on medium high and bring it to a rapid boil, stirring occasionally, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan. Secure a candy thermometer to the side of the pan.\nThe marmalade may take anywhere from 15 to 30 minutes or so to set. After about 10 minutes, start checking it frequently.\n2 Test to see if the marmalade is at setting point: Once the mixture reaches a temperature of 218\xc2\xb0F it is close to the set point. It should set between 218\xc2\xb0F and 222\xc2\xb0F (or 6 to 10\xc2\xb0F above the boiling point at your altitude).\nYou can tell if the mixture has reached its set point by putting a small amount of the jelly liquid on a chilled plate, and looking for signs of it wrinkling when you push it with your finger tip.\nWhile thermometers aren\'t always accurate, the wrinkle test works. If the jelly wrinkles on a cold plate, it\'s ready.\nPut several small plates into the freezer to chill. As the marmalade temperature reaches 218\xc2\xb0F, start testing it by placing a small amount of the hot jelly on a chilled plate. If the jelly spreads out and thins immediately, it isn\'t ready. If it holds its shape a bit, that\'s a good sign. Let it cool on the plate for a few seconds.\nPush up against it with your finger tip. If the jelly sample wrinkles at all, it is time to take the jelly off the heat.\nIf it wrinkles even just a little, it\'s ready\nWhen you use a candy thermometer to test the temperature of your mixture, make sure the probe is NOT touching the bottom of the pan. Make sure the indentation on the probe (with modern candy thermometers this is about an inch and a half from the bottom of the probe) is actually surrounded by the mixture. You may have to tilt the pan to one side, to cover the probe sufficiently to get a good reading.\nOvercooking a marmalade will result in a caramelized flavor or tough orange peels in your marmalade.\nCANNING THE MARMALADE\n1 Sterilize the canning jars: There are several ways to sterilize your jars for canning. You can run them through a short cycle on your dishwasher.\nYou can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don\'t touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes.\nOr you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 minutes.\n2 Sterilize the lids: As the time approaches for the marmalade to be done, boil some water in a tea pot. Put the jar lids in a glass or ceramic bowl and pour the boiling water over them to sterilize.\n3 Ladle jam into sterilized jars: Once the jelly has reached its set point, remove the jelly pot from the heat. Let the jelly sit in the pot for a couple minutes (that will help keep the peels from floating in the jars).\nCarefully pour or ladle the marmalade into the jars, one at a time, leaving 1/4 inch head space at the top of the jars for a vacuum seal.\n4 Clean rims, secure with lids and jar ring: Wipe the rim clean with a clean, wet paper towel. Place the lid on the jar, securing with a jar ring. Work quickly.\n5 Process in water bath (optional): If you want, you can process the jars in a hot water bath for 5 minutes to help get a better seal and to help prevent mold. If you used boiling water in an earlier step to sterilize the jars, you can just keep the same set-up for the water bath. You want to make sure there is a rack at the bottom of the pot so that the jars aren\'t actually resting on the bottom of the pot.\n6 Allowing the jars to seal: Once you have sealed the jars with a lid and ring, and have water bathed (or not) the jars, let them sit on your kitchen counter. As the marmalade cools, you\'ll hear a popping noise as a vacuum is created in the headspace of the jars, pulling the lids down.\nSometimes the marmalade orange peels float to the top of the jar, so to help keep that from happening, turn the jars upside down for half an hour at a time. Keep turning every 30 minutes or so until the marmalade seems stable and the peels are well distributed through the marmalade.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nMeyer Lemon Marmalade Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hourCook time: 1 hourYield: Makes 6-8 half-pint (8-ounce) jars\nThis recipe calls for Meyer lemons, a hybrid of a regular lemon and an orange, that is thinner skinned and sweeter than a regular lemon. You cannot substitute regular lemons for Meyer lemons in this recipe.\nThe proportion of lemon segments to water to sugar is 1:1:1. So if you don\'t have a kitchen scale and don\'t weigh your lemons to begin with, as you proceed through this recipe keep in mind these proportions. Your 2 1/2 lbs of lemons should yield 6 cups of chopped lemon. 6 cups of chopped lemon will be cooked first with 6 cups of water, and then later 6 cups of sugar are added.\nYou can also do this recipe with 4 cups of chopped lemons, 4 cups of water, and 4 cups of sugar. Do not double the recipe.\nDo not reduce the sugar (if you want a reduced sugar recipe, use a different recipe); the sugar is needed for the jelly to set.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 1/2 lbs of Meyer lemons (about 9 lemons)\n6 cups water\n6 cups granulated sugar\nSpecial equipment:\n1 wide 6 or 8-quart pan (Stainless steel or copper with stainless steel lining, not aluminum which will leach)\nA sharp chef\'s knife\nA candy thermometer or instant-read thermometer (I use a thermapen or thermopop)\n6 half-pint (8-oz) canning jars\nCheesecloth, enough to double over and form a bag to hold the seeds for making pectin, or a Muslin jelly bag\nAdditional Equipment Recommended:\nFlexible plastic cutting board surface (to curl up to catch the lemon juice from the lemons to add to the fruit)\nDisposable latex or non-latex gloves to protect your hands from the acid from the lemons\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nPREPARING THE FRUIT\n1 Scrub the lemons clean. Discard any that are moldy or damaged.\n2 Prepare the lemons: Cut 1/4 inch off from the ends of the lemons. Working one at a time, stand a lemon on end. Cut the lemon in half lengthwise. Cut each lemon half into several segments, lengthwise.\nAs you cut the lemons into segments, if you can, pull off any exposed membranes. Just get the ones that are easy to get to, ignore the rest. When you\'ve cut down to the final segment, cut away the pithy core. Remove all seeds from the segments. Reserve the seeds and any removed membrane or pith. You will need them to make pectin.\nCut each lemon segment crosswise into even pieces to make little triangles of lemon peel and pulp.\n3 Put seeds, membranes, pith into cheesecloth or muslin bag: Put all of the seeds, membranes and pith you removed from the lemons into a bag fashioned out of two layers of cheesecloth or a muslin jelly bag.\n  FIRST STAGE OF COOKING\n4 Place the lemon segments and water into a large, wide pot.\n5 Secure pectin bag: Place the pectin bag in the pot with the fruit pulp and secure to the pot handle.\n6 Boil until peels are soft: Bring mixture to a strong boil on high heat. Let boil, uncovered, for about 25-35 minutes, until the peels are soft and cooked through. (If too much of the water evaporates from the boil and the peels start sticking to the bottom of the pan, add a little more water back in.)\nTest one of the lemon peel pieces by eating it. It should be very soft. If it is still chewy, keep cooking until soft.\nRemove from heat.\n7 Remove the pectin bag, place the pectin bag in a bowl and let cool until it is comfortable to touch.\nADD THE PECTIN AND SUGAR\n8 Squeeze pectin from pectin bag: Once your pectin bag has cooled to the point you can handle it, if you want, squeeze it like play-doh to extract any extra pectin. This is not necessary but will help ensure a good set. (I like to wear latex-type gloves for this part.) You should be able to get a teaspoon or two more from the bag. It has the consistency of sour cream. Return this pectin to the pan with the lemon mixture.\n9 Add sugar: Measure out your sugar and add it to the pan with the lemon mixture.\n  SECOND STAGE OF COOKING\n10 Boil and check temperature: Heat the jelly mixture on medium high and bring it to a rapid boil, stirring occasionally, making sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan.\nAfter the jelly first comes to a boil, it will foam up considerably. this is why you need need to use a large pot, and make sure you pay attention and keep your eyes on the whole process. Stir with a wooden spoon to bring the foam back down. If it gets too high, lower the temperature to keep it from overflowing the pot.\nSecure a candy thermometer to the side of the pan, or check the jelly temperature with an instant read thermometer. The marmalade may take anywhere from 20 to 35 minutes or so to be ready to pour out. After about 15 minutes, start checking the temperature frequently.\n11 Test to see if the marmalade is at set point: There are two ways to test that the marmalade is ready to pour out into jars: the mixture reaching a temperature of 218-220\xc2\xb0F (6-8\xc2\xb0F above the boiling point at your altitude) OR putting a bit of it on a chilled plate "wrinkling up" when you push it with your finger tip. I steer off of the wrinkle test. If the sample of jelly wrinkles, it\'s ready. I use a thermometer just to help me gauge when to do the wrinkle test.\nFor the wrinkle test, place a small plate into the freezer. As the jelly temperature reaches 217\xc2\xb0F, start testing it by placing a small amount of the hot jelly on the chilled plate. If the jelly spreads out and thins immediately, it isn\'t ready. If it holds its shape a bit, like an egg yolk, that\'s a good sign. Push up against it with your finger tip. If the jelly sample wrinkles at all, it is time to take the jelly off the heat and pour it out into jars.\nWhen you use a candy thermometer or an insta-read thermometer to test the temperature of your mixture, make sure the probe is NOT touching the bottom of the pan. Make sure that the indentation on the probe (with modern candy thermometers this is about an inch and a half from the bottom of the probe) is actually surrounded by the mixture. This may mean that you have to tilt the pan to one side, to cover the probe sufficiently to get a good reading.\n  CANNING\n12 Sterilize canning jars: While the marmalade is in its second cooking stage, rinse out your canning jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven. They should be in the oven at least 10 minutes before using them. This not only sterilizes the jars, but it helps to keep them from cracking from the temperature differential when you add the hot jelly mixture to them.\n13 Sterilize lids: As the time approaches for the marmalade to be done, boil some water in a tea pot. Put the jar lids in a glass or ceramic bowl and pour the boiling water over them to sterilize.\n14 Ladle marmalade into sterilized jars: Once the jelly has reached 218-220\xc2\xb0F or its "wrinkly" stage, remove the jelly pot from the heat. Carefully ladle the jelly into the jars, leaving 1/4 inch head space at the top of the jars for a vacuum seal.\n15 Clean rims, secure with lids and jar ring: Wipe the rim clean with a clean, wet paper towel. Place the lid on the jar, securing with a jar ring. Work quickly.\n16 Allow jars to cool and seal: Allow the jars to sit overnight. You will hear them make a popping sound as a vacuum seal is created.\nEven if the jelly is not firm as it goes into the jar (it shouldn\'t be), it should firm up as it cools.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nJalapeno Pepper Jelly Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 20 minutesMash straining time: Several hoursYield: Makes 4-5 half-pint jars of jelly\nTart green apples have more pectin in them than sweet apples, so use tart green apples for this recipe, earlier in the season the better. This is especially true if you are not also using cranberries, as cranberries have their own natural pectin as well.\nJalape\xc3\xb1o jelly can be pretty "hot" if you have included a lot of the seeds in your cooking. The jelly is great served on crackers with cream cheese because the fat molecules in the cream cheese absorb the hot capsaicin of the jalape\xc3\xb1os, reducing the heat, but leaving the flavor of the chiles. This is also why sour cream tastes so good with spicy Mexican food.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 lbs of tart apples (e.g. Granny Smith), unpeeled, chopped into big pieces, including the cores\n6 jalape\xc3\xb1o chili peppers, sliced in half lengthwise, the seeds and ribs removed from 3 of them (for mildly hot jelly. If you want a hotter jelly leave the seeds and ribs in all of them.)\n1 green bell pepper (or red if you want the color), seeds and ribs removed, chopped\n1 cup cranberries (optional but recommended, will help with color and with setting)\n3 cups water\n3 cups white vinegar\n3 1/2 cups sugar (7/8 cup for each cup of juice)\nSpecial equipment:\nOne 6-quart pan (Stainless steel or copper with stainless steel)\nA digital thermometer\nA large fine mesh sieve (or several layers of cheesecloth, or a muslin cloth jelly bag)\n4-5 half-pint canning jars\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Boil and mash the apples, jalape\xc3\xb1os, bell pepper, and cranberries: Combine the apple pieces, apple cores (needed for their pectin content), jalape\xc3\xb1os, bell pepper, cranberries (if using), water and vinegar in a large pot.\nBring to a boil and then reduce heat to medium-low, simmering for about 20 minutes, or until the apples, cranberries, and peppers are soft. Stir occasionally to make sure nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan where it might burn.\nUse a potato masher to mash up the apple pieces to the consistency of slightly runny apple sauce. If the mash is too thick, add more water.\n2 Strain through a fine mesh sieve or cheesecloth: Spoon the mash into a fine mesh sieve, muslin cloth, or a couple layers of cheesecloth, suspended over a large bowl. Leave to strain for several hours (even overnight).\nIf you want a clear jelly, do not squeeze or force through the mesh. Just let it drip. If you want a fuller flavor jelly and don\'t mind that the result won\'t be clear, you can force some of the pulp through the mesh.\nIf your pulp is too thick, and nothing is coming out, you can add an extra 1/2 cup or cup of water to it. You want to end up with about 4 cups of juice.\n3 Add sugar to juice, heat to dissolve: Measure the juice, then pour into a large, wide, thick-bottomed pot. Add the sugar (7/8 a cup for each cup of juice). Heat gently, stirring to make sure the sugar gets dissolved and doesn\'t stick to the bottom of the pan and burn.\n4 Boil until setting point: Bring to a boil. Cook for 10-15 minutes, using a spoon to skim off the surface scum.\nContinue to boil until a digital thermometer shows that the temperature has reached 220-222\xc2\xb0F (8-10\xc2\xb0F above the boiling point at your altitude).\nAdditional time needed for cooking can be anywhere from 10 minutes to an hour or longer, depending on the amount of water, sugar, and apple pectin in the mix.\n\nLeft: Jelly is too runny. Right: Jelly is wrinkling when pushed, which means it\'s ready.\nA thermometer reading isn\'t always the most reliable indicator of whether or not a jelly is done. Another way to test is put a half teaspoonful of the jelly on a chilled (in the freezer) plate. Allow the jelly to cool a few seconds, then push it with your fingertip. If it wrinkles up, it\'s ready.\n5 Can in jars: Pour jelly into sterilized jars* to within 1/4" from the top and seal.\nMakes approx. 4 half-pint jars.\nServe with cream cheese on crackers.\n*There are several ways to sterilize your jars for canning jelly. You can run them through a short cycle on your dishwasher. You can place them in a large pot (12 quart) of water on top of a steaming rack (so they don\'t touch the bottom of the pan), and bring the water to a boil for 10 minutes. Or you can rinse out the jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 minutes.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nMarinated Roasted Red Bell Peppers Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 40 minutesWater bath time: 15 minutesYield: Makes 3 pint jars\nRecipe adapted from Eugenia Bone\'s fabulous canning book Well-Preserved and a marinated pepper recipe from University of Minnesota.\nUser water bath method instructions if canning for shelf storage, otherwise just use clean jars and lids and store in the refrigerator for up to 3 weeks.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 pounds firm, fresh, clean red bell peppers\n1 cup bottled lemon juice*\n2 cups white vinegar (5%)\n1 cup extra virgin olive oil + additional for roasting the peppers\n2 cloves garlic, quartered\n1 1/2 teaspoons salt\n3 pint canning jars\n*Bottle lemon juice has a consistent level of acidity which you need for this canning recipe.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare water bath and mason jars if canning: If you are canning for shelf storage (and not just chilling in the refrigerator), place a steaming rack at the bottom of a large (12-qt) pot, add the empty mason jars that you will be using for canning.\nFill the pot with enough water to cover the jars and bring to a boil. It takes a while to get a large pot of water to boil, so while the water is heating, proceed with the recipe.\n2a Blacken Peppers, Broiler Method Position rack in oven so that the top surface of bell peppers placed in the oven will be 4-5 inches from the broiler heat element. Rub the surface of the peppers with a little olive oil (this will help them blister faster).\nPreheat broiler on high. Place peppers either directly on the top oven rack, with a pan to catch the drippings on a rack beneath, or place on a aluminum-foil or Silpat lined broiler pan (a cookie sheet will warp).\nAs the surface of the peppers blister and blacken, turn them with tongs so that they will blacken on all sides.\n2b Blacken Peppers, Stovetop Method If you have a gas range (or grill) you can place the peppers directly on the range top so that the flames lick the peppers. Work carefully so that as soon as one section of a pepper is blackened, you turn it to work on a fresh side.\nIf you have an electric stove, heat a cast iron pan on high and place the peppers in the pan, allowing the peel to blister and blacken, turning so that all sides get blackened.\n3 Remove blackened peel: When the peppers are all well blistered and blackened, place in a non-reactive bowl and cover. (The steam from the hot peppers will help dislodge the skins.)\nOnce the peppers have cooled enough to handle, work with them one by one over a plate, gently peel off the blackened skins.\nCut the peppers in half and remove and discard the seed pods, stems and all seeds.\n4 Heat lemon juice, white vinegar, olive oil, garlic, and salt, in a saucepan until boiling.\n5 Sterilize the lids: If canning for shelf storage, remove some boiling water from the pot of boiling water in step one and place into a bowl. Put the lids in that bowl.\n6 Distribute peppers and vinegar mixture in jars: Use tongs or a jar lifter to remove mason jars from the boiling water in step 1 (if canning). Distribute the peppers evenly among the jars. Pour the hot vinegar mixture over the peppers to cover (try to make sure some garlic gets in each jar).\nLeave 1/2-inch head space on the jars. Wipe the rims with a clean, dampened paper towel. Place on lids and rings (do not tighten rings too tight).\nAt this point you can store in the refrigerator for several weeks. If you want longer storage, or shelf storage, proceed.\n7 Water bath for canning: Place filled jars in boiling water on a rack (from step 1). (Helps to use tongs and wear thick rubber gloves). Water should cover jars by at least an inch. Boil for 15 minutes.\nLet cool in pot for several minutes, remove. Let cool completely. You should hear the jars "pop" as the lids seal.\nIf a jar does not seal, store it in the refrigerator and use up within a few weeks. Otherwise the jars should last a year.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nHow to Make Easy Refrigerator Pickles\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 5 minutesPickling time: 24 hoursYield: 2 pint jars of pickles\nYou can use this method to make pickle spears as well! They\'ll need to pickle for 2 to 3 days in the fridge before they\'re ready.\nAs is, the recipe makes a fairly sweet pickle. You can cut the sugar in half for a more sour and tart pickle, if desired.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Kirby or other small cucumbers\n1 small sweet yellow onion\n1 cup apple cider vinegar\n1 cup water\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon kosher salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons pickling spice, homemade or store-bought\nSpecial equipment:\n2 wide-mouth pint canning jars\nCanning jar lids, plastic or metal\nMandoline, or sharp knife\nCanning funnel (helpful, but not essential)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Wash and dry the jars and cucumbers: Wash 2 wide-mouth pint jars and their lids in hot, soapy water. Set them aside to dry.\nRinse the cucumbers well under cold water, pat them dry, and then set them on a towel to dry completely.\n2 Slice the cucumbers and onion, then pack them in the jars: With a sharp knife or a mandoline slicer, slice the cucumbers and onion into slices 1/8- to 1/4-inch thick.\nFirmly pack the cucumbers and onions into the jars, fitting in as many as you can without smashing the vegetables. Leave 1/2-inch or so of headspace at the top of the jars.\n3 Make the brine: In a small saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the vinegar, water, sugar, salt, and pickling spice up to a simmer. Stir occasionally and continue simmering until the sugar and salt are dissolved.\n4 Pour the brine over the vegetables: If you have a canning funnel, use it here to make it easier to fill the jars. Carefully pour or ladle the hot brine into each jar, filling the jars until the cucumbers and onions are covered. It\'s ok if a few small pieces poke out the top.\n5 Cool and refrigerate for 24 hours: Screw on the lids, then let the jars cool to room temperature (about an hour). The cucumbers will start off bright green, but will become darker and more "pickle-colored" as they cool.\nPlace them in the refrigerator. Wait at least 24 hours before eating the pickles in order to let the flavors develop. Use them within one month.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

If you plan on storing in the refrigerator and using up within a few months, you can skip the sterilization and canning steps (steps 1 and 4).\nINGREDIENTS\n2 1/2 pounds firm green tomatoes, about 7 cups, cored and chopped\n1 1/4 cups brown sugar, packed\n1 cup chopped red onion\n1 cup golden raisins\n1 cup cider vinegar\n2 Tbsp chopped candied ginger\n1 Tbsp mustard seeds\n1 teaspoon chili pepper flakes\n1 teaspoon fennel seeds\n1 teaspoon of salt\n1/2 teaspoon ground allspice\n1/8 teaspoon ground cloves\n1 cinnamon stick\nPinch of ground nutmeg\nSpecial equipment:\n3 pint jars or 6 8-ounce jars for canning\nSteamer rack\nJar lifter (helpful for lifting jars out of boiling water)\nLarge 16-quart pot\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Sterilize the jars and lids: Place a steamer rack in a large (16 quart) pot, and place the jars on the rack. Fill the jars and the pot with water up to the rim of the jars.\nIf you don't have a rack you can place a clean dish towel at the base of the pot. You want to prevent the glass jars from touching the bottom of the pot which can get quite hot and cause the glass to crack.\nPut the burner on high and heat until a rolling boil. Boil for 10 minutes. To sterilize the lids, place them in a bowl and pour boiling water over them.\n2 Put all ingredients into a large pot and cook them 45 minutes: Place all of the ingredients in a medium sized (about 4 qt) thick-bottomed pot.\nBring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook for 45 minutes. Taste and adjust seasonings.\n3 Scoop chutney into jars: Remove the jars from the pot of hot water (reserving the water if you plan to can for shelf storage.). Scoop the green tomato chutney into the jars, filling them to 1/4 of an inch from the rim.\nWipe the rims with a clean wet paper towel. Place sterilized lids on the jars. Secure with canning rings.\n4 Process filled jars in a water bath: Place the filled jars back on the steamer rack in the pot of hot water. Make sure the jars are covered with an inch of water.\nBring to a boil and process for 15 minutes, or 20 minutes if you are at altitudes between 1000 and 6000 feet.\nRemove the jars from the pot and place on a dish towel spread out on your counter. Allow the jars to cool completely.\nThe jar lids should make a popping sound as they seal. If a lid doesn't seal for some reason, store the jar in the refrigerator.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nMicrowave Strawberry Jam Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 15 minutesMacerating time: 30 minutesYield: 1 1/2 cups of jam\nThe best strawberries for making strawberry jam are those that are firm and not soft, overly ripe, or too sweet.\nYou can sub 1/2 cup of the strawberries for 1/2 cup of chopped orange segments for more orange flavor. Just don't use more than 2 1/2 cups of fruit or your bowl may overflow in the microwave.\nYou can swap out some of the lemon juice with balsamic vinegar.\nA tiny pinch of finely ground black pepper added in step 1 can add some zing to the jam.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 1/2 cups hulled and quartered strawberries (from about 1 pound)\n2 teaspoons orange zest\n2 Tbsp lemon juice\n1/2 cup sugar (can reduce to 1/4 cup if you would like your jam less sweet)\nSpecial equipment:\nAn 8-cup Pyrex measuring cup OR a large microwave safe bowl (no metal)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toss berries with orange zest, lemon juice, sugar: Place the quartered strawberries, orange zest, lemon juice, and sugar in a large microwave-safe bowl (at least 10 cup capacity) or 8-cup Pyrex measuring cup.\nGently toss to combine so that the strawberries are well coated with the sugar. Let sit for 30 minutes at room temp to macerate.\n2 Microwave in 5 min intervals: Place bowl with strawberries on a plate (to catch possible overflow) in your microwave oven. Cook on high for intervals of 5 minutes each, gently stirring after each 5 minute interval.\nIn my 1650 Watt microwave, I use 3 intervals of 5 minutes each for a total of 15 minutes. If you have a lower powered microwave, you may need to cook longer, or if you have a higher powered microwave, you may need less time.\nPay attention so that the mixture doesn't overflow. If it bubbles up too much and begins to overflow, put the mixture in a larger (microwave safe) bowl and continue.\nThe jam mixture will be ready when the liquid in it thickens slightly and gets syrupy. Because it is hot, it will not be thick like regular jam. As it cools it should thicken.\n3 Pour into jar, let cool, then chill: Pour the hot jam into a jar. Let cool to room temperature then store in the refrigerator.\nIf the jam is too loose and watery even after it has chilled, it may need to be microwaved for several minutes longer.\nIf you want your jam to be shelf stable, use the full amount of recommended sugar (1/2 cup), use sterilized jars and lids, and leave 1/4 inch headspace from the top of the jar. Otherwise, store in the refrigerator, or freeze (leaving an inch headspace in the jar to account for the expansion of the liquid as it freezes into ice).\nHello!

You will cook the fruit mixture on the high setting for approximately 15 minutes.\nAs soon as the mixture starts to boil, after about 6 to 8 minutes, stop the cooking and stir. Continue cooking and stir every few minutes.\nAt about 13 minutes the mixture should start to get viscous. If you spoon out a bit on to a small plate that has been in the freezer, you can push the mixture around a bit with your finger tip to see how thick it is.\nIf it is runny, cook it a couple minutes more. You can also check by seeing how the jam runs off of a spoon. If it seems to firm up a bit as it drips, it's done.\nIf you use a large pyrex measuring cup as we have done here, you can see that you start with close to 3 cups of liquid. You want to boil it down to 2 cups.\n3 Pour into jars: Pour out the jam into jars, leaving 1/4-inch of headroom from the top of the jars. If you want to keep your jam in a cupboard, then use sterilized jars (heat them in the oven at 200\xc2\xb0F for 10 minutes). If you plan to eat up quickly and will keep them in the refrigerator, regular clean jars will do.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

If you don't have gloves, you can protect your hands with plastic baggies. If you must handle the cut peppers with your bare hands, rub a little vegetable oil over your hands first. The oil will provide your pores with some protection.\nWash your hands thoroughly with warm soapy water after handling the peppers. Do not touch your eyes for several hours.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds jalape\xc3\xb1o chile peppers\n1 pound white or yellow onions, thinly sliced\n1/4 cup pickling salt (can use Kosher salt or sea salt as a substitute, regular table salt has additives in it that will darken your pickles and make the color of the pickle juice muddy)\n1 1/4 cup white distilled vinegar\n1 cup apple cider vinegar\n2 1/4 cups sugar\n1 tablespoon mustard seeds\n1 star anise\n1 cardamom pod\n3/4 teaspoon celery seeds\n1 inch cinnamon stick\n6 whole cloves\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric\nSpecial equipment:\n2 clean 1-quart canning jars, or 4 pint jars\nMETHOD\n1 Prep the jalape\xc3\xb1os: Cut the stem end off of the jalape\xc3\xb1os. Then cut them in half lengthwise. Remove and discard the seeds and the ribs.\n2 Salt peppers and onions, cover with ice, chill: Place the peppers in a large bowl. Add the onions and stir in the pickling salt so that it is well distributed. Cover the peppers with a clean, thin towel. Put ice over the towel and place the bowl in the refrigerator to chill for at 4 hours.\n3 Rinse and drain the peppers and onions: After the jalape\xc3\xb1os and onions have been chilling for 4 hours, rinse the salt off of the peppers and onions. Drain, and rinse and drain again.\n4 Make pickling solution: In a 4 or 6 quart pot, put the vinegar, sugar, and spices. Bring to a boil to dissolve the sugar.\n5 Boil peppers and onions in pickling solution: Add the peppers and onions to the pot with the pickling solution. Bring to a boil again.\n6 Pack jars with peppers and onions: Watch the jalape\xc3\xb1o peppers. As soon as they are all cooked through (you can tell because their color changes from a vibrant to a more dull green), start packing your canning jars with the peppers and onions, using a slotted spoon to remove them from the pan.\nPack the jars evenly with the peppers and onions, up to about an inch from the top of the jars.\nThen pour the sugary vinegar mixture over the peppers, until it covers them.\n7 Seal and chill: Cover the jars and let cool to room temperature before chilling in the refrigerator.\nIf you are planning to store outside of the refrigerator or for an extended period of time, use canning jars. Sterilize your jars and lids first. Wipe the rims of the jars after you pack them with pickles. Process in a water bath for 10 minutes.

This recipe can be easily doubled; if doubling, use an 8-quart pot.\nINGREDIENTS\n5 cups of chopped apricots, pits discarded*\n2 + 3/4 cups of sugar\n1/3 cup of Riesling (or Gew\xc3\xbcrztraminer)\n5 tablespoons of lemon juice\nMETHOD\n1 Place a couple small plates in the freezer, these will be used to test the jam later.\n2 Bring apricots, sugar, wine, lemon juice to a boil: Place the apricots, sugar, wine, and lemon juice in a large (at least 4-qt), thick-bottomed, stainless steel pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.\n3 Skim the foam, gently stir: The mixture will boil and rise in volume. Skim off the pale yellow foam that forms at the top and discard. The boil will subside to larger bubbles, but still bubble vigorously. Be sure to begin gently stirring the jam frequently to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.\n4 Test jam on cold plate: After about 25 minutes begin testing the jam by placing a small amount on a cold plate. Allow 30 seconds to pass and then run your finger through it to see what the cooled consistency will be. Boil for a few minutes longer if desired for a thicker jam.\n5 Ladle into jars: Ladle into hot, sterilized canning jars** and seal leaving 1/4 inch of head space. Before applying the lids, sterilize the lids by placing them in a bowl and pouring boiling water over them. Wipe the rims of the jars clean before applying the lids.\nWill keep for up to a year.\n* If you want, you can use a few of the kernels from the pits to give your jam a slight almond-y flavor. Roast the pits at 350 for about 10 minutes. Take them and crack them open with a hammer (do outside on concrete), and extract the kernel. Roast the "nuts" for a couple of minutes. Pop one or two in each sterilized jar when you pour the jam in.\n** To sterilize the jars, rinse out clean Mason jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, upright in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 minutes.\nHello!

If you need to freeze, let the crackers warm up for about 10 minutes before cracking.\nINGREDIENTS\n28 to 35 saltine crackers (about one sleeve, enough to line your tray)\n1 cup (220 g) packed dark brown sugar\n1 cup (225 g or 2 sticks) unsalted butter\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n2 cups (10 to 12 ounces) semi-sweet chocolate\nSpecial equipment:\nJelly roll pan (10x15-inches)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 400F. Line a 10x15-inch jelly roll pan with nonstick aluminum foil (preferred) or regular heavy duty foil, making sure that the foil completely covers the bottom and sides of the pan. If using regular foil, spray lightly with baking spray. Line the saltine crackers in a single layer on the bottom.\n2 Make the caramel sauce: Place the brown sugar, butter and salt in a medium sized saucepan. Cook on medium heat, stirring frequently, until the butter melts. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally, for another 3 to 5 minutes, just until the mixture comes to a boil and starts to darken. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.\n(Note: You\'re not actually making true caramel here, so you don\'t need to be as precise or worry about the temperature of the caramel. Just make sure it comes to a boil and wait for it to darken slightly, then continue.)\n3 Pour the hot brown sugar mixture over the saltine crackers. Spread to evenly coat the crackers.\n4 Move the pan to the oven and bake for 5 minutes. The caramel will be hot and bubbly.\n5 Melt the chocolate: Place the chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. Cook it in the microwave in 30-second intervals at full power, stirring between each cook time, until the chocolate has melted.\n6 Pour the chocolate over the baked crackers: Once the crackers are done baking, remove from oven and allow to cool for 1 minute, until the caramel is no longer bubbling. Then pour the melted chocolate over the crackers. Use a spatula to spread the chocolate evenly over the top.\n7 Cool the crackers overnight: Let the crackers cool to room temperature then move to the refrigerator and cool over night.\n8 "Crack" the crackers: The crackers will form a single sheet once cool. Remove from pan and gently peel the foil away, being careful not to tear the foil. (If any bits of foil tear and get stuck in the caramel, break those bits away and discard.) Cut the candy into snack-sized pieces using a chefs knife (you can use your hands, too, but I find it easier with a knife).\nStore in an airtight container in the refrigerator for about a week.\nHello!

Just before butter is melted, add all dark brown sugar at once and stir with wooden spoon until sugar is uniformly wet.\n3 Stir infrequently: Stir infrequently until mixture goes from looking grainy to molten lava. Make sure to get into the corners of your pot, and watch closely to notice how the mixture changes. It will take about 3 to 5 minutes.\n4 Note the texture: Right before you add the cream, the caramelizing brown sugar will begin to look and feel more like liquid and less like thick wet sand.\n5 Add the cream, let boil: At this point add all the cream at once and replace your spoon with a whisk. Lower heat a little and whisk cream into mixture.\nWhen liquid is uniform, turn heat back to medium and whisk every few minutes for a total of 10 minutes or until it registers 225\xc2\xb0F on a digital or candy thermometer.\n6 Let rest, then transfer to storage vehicle to cool: After liquid has been boiling on the stove for its 10 minutes, turn heat off and let rest for a minute or two before transferring into a heatproof storage vessel. (I prefer a stainless steel or glass bowl.) Cool to room temperature.\n7 Taste, add salt and vanilla extract to taste: When butterscotch liquid is room temperature, take a small taste. It's important to know what cooked brown sugar and butter tastes like, and what happens when transforming that flat sweetness into real butterscotch flavor.\nWhisk in half the salt and vanilla extract. Taste again. Add more salt and vanilla extract until the marvelous taste of real butterscotch is achieved.\nButterscotch makes a fantastic topping for ice cream.\nChill butterscotch sauce in a non-reactive container with a tightly fitting lid only after sauce has chilled completely. It will keep for one month refrigerated, that is if you can keep from eating it all the moment it has cooled down and been seasoned to your liking.\nHello!

Set it to the side to become foamy.\nIn the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, whisk together the remaining sugar, flour, salt, 3 tablespoons of melted butter. Add the yeast-milk mixture. Mix on low speed until a shaggy dough forms, then turn the mixer up to medium-low and knead for 10 minutes (set a timer!). When done, the dough should form a ball and spring back when you poke it.\n2 Let the dough rise for one hour, or overnight: Gather the dough into a ball with your hands and place into a greased bowl. Cover well with plastic wrap. Let the dough rise on the counter for 1 hour, until doubled in size, or place in the fridge to rise overnight. (The dough may not quite double in size if you\'re refrigerating overnight, but it should look risen and puffed.)\n3 Make the apples while the dough rises (or before assembling, if you\'ve chilled the dough overnight): Melt the butter for the apples in a medium skillet. Add the diced apples, cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Cook over medium heat for about five minutes until the apples are just tender. Remove from the heat and set aside to cool. (The apples can be made up to a day ahead and kept refrigerated.)\n4 Make the caramel sauce: In a large saucepan, combine the sugar and 1/2 cup of the apple cider, and stir over low heat until the sugar has dissolved. Once the sugar has dissolved, stop stirring, increase the heat to medium-low, and bring the mixture to a boil.\nContinue to boil (without stirring!) until the sugar turns a deep golden caramel color, 320F to 330F. Remove from the heat and stir in the butter, followed by the salt, cream, and remaining 2 tablespoons of cider. Whisk until smooth. (Caramel sauce can be cooled and refrigerated for several days; warm briefly in the microwave or on the stovetop, until it\'s a "drizzle" consistency, before assembling.)\n5 Assemble the monkey bread: Grease a bundt pan well and set aside. Melt the butter needed for assembly. In a separate bowl, mix together the sugar and cinnamon.\nTear off walnut- or golf ball-sized pieces of dough and roll into balls between your hands, They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be uniform! Dip each dough ball into the melted butter, roll in cinnamon sugar, and place in the bottom of the prepared bundt until there is a good layer on the bottom of the pan (using up about half the dough).\nSpoon all of the apples over the dough, followed by a third of the caramel sauce. Continue rolling the remaining dough and layering in the pan. Drizzle another third of the caramel sauce over the top. (Save the rest of the caramel sauce for serving).\n6 Let the monkey bread rise for 30 to 60 minutes: Cover the monkey bread with plastic wrap. Room temperature dough will take about 30 minutes to rise; dough that\'s cold from the fridge will take 30 to 60 minutes. Let the monkey bread rise until the top looks slightly puffed and pillowy.\n7 Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n8 Bake the monkey bread: Uncover the bundt pan and transfer to a sheet pan (to catch butter drips!). Place in the oven and bake for 30 to 35 minutes. When done, the top should have risen slightly over the top of the pan and the bread should be a deep golden brown.\n9 Cool and serve! Cool the monkey bread in the bundt pan on a wire rack for 15 minutes. Place a serving plate over the pan, and using oven mitts, flip the pan over to unmold the monkey bread onto the plate.\nDrizzle with the remaining caramel sauce and serve. Be careful, the bread will still be hot!\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'
b"Print\nCaramelized Pecan Tart Recipe\nYield: Serves 8 to 10\nINGREDIENTS\nCrust:\n1 cup all purpose flour\n1 Tbsp white granulated sugar\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup chilled butter (4 ounces, 1 stick), cut into cubes\n1 Tbsp ice water\nFilling:\n1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened\n1 1/2 cups dark brown sugar\n1 large egg\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\nPinch of salt\n2 cups of whole pecans\n Equipment needed:\nOne 9-inch by 1-inch tart pan with a removable bottom\nFood processor to make the tart dough\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the dough. Combine in a food processor the flour, sugar, and salt. Pulse to blend. Add the cubed butter and pulse until you have pea-sized pieces of butter. Add 1 Tbsp ice water and pulse until the dough starts to come together into a ball. Turn the dough out onto a clean surface and form into a ball with your hands. Flatten into a disc form, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n2 Form the crust. Press the dough into the center of the tart pan and work it with your fingers and the palm of your hand so that it spreads to the edges and up the sides of the tart pan. Lay a large piece of aluminum foil into the pan on top of the dough and press it into the dough so that it helps the dough keep its shape in the pan. Then place the pan into the freezer for 30 minutes.\n3 Blind bake the crust. Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. After 30 minutes, remove the pan from the freezer and gently remove the foil from the dough. Place the pan on top of a sheet of foil (to catch drippings) on top of a baking sheet. Prick the bottom of the tart dough with the tines of a fork in several places and place the tart pan in the oven. Bake for 15 -20 minutes, or until the dough is lightly browned. Remove from oven and let sit at room temperature to cool.\n4 Make the filling. Put the butter, brown sugar, egg, and salt in a large bowl. Stir until well combined. Then gently stir in the pecans. Pour the filling into the pre-baked, cooled tart shell.\n5 Bake the tart. Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Place the tart on a foil lined pan and bake for about 25 minutes until lightly browned and slightly puffy all over. Remove from oven and let cool to touch. Then while the tart is still slightly warm, gently remove the outer ring of the tart pan, leaving the tart on the metal tart pan bottom. Let cool all the way before cutting to serve.\nServe with whipped cream. Use a sharp chef's knife to cut the tart. You have to cut through pecans, so make strong, swift cuts.\nHello!

b"Print\nSpicy Caramel Popcorn Clusters Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: 8 servings\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup roasted peanuts\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon chili powder\n1/2 teaspoon sugar\n1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1/3 cup popcorn\n3 tablespoons canola oil\n1/2 cup unsalted butter\n1 cup brown sugar\n1/2 cup light corn syrup\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Get everything ready: Add roasted peanuts to a large bowl (you'll add the popcorn later). In a separate, small bowl, mix together the spice mixture (salt, chili powder, sugar, and cayenne). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and set it aside.\n2 Pop the popcorn: Add canola oil to a large pot over medium heat. Add one kernel of popcorn to the pot and cover the lid. When that kernel pops, it means your oil is at the right temperature.\nRemove the single kernel and pour in all the popcorn. Off the heat, cover the pot and wait 30 seconds to bring all the kernels up to temperature. Return the pot to heat and shake vigorously while the popcorn pops to prevent burning.\nWhen the popping slows to a few seconds between pops, remove from heat and pour into the large bowl with the peanuts. There may be some unpopped kernels, but that\xe2\x80\x99s better than burned popcorn.\nFor more detailed instructions on how to pop popcorn, see HERE\n3 Make the caramel: Melt the butter in a medium pot over medium heat. Add the brown sugar and corn syrup and stir well to combine. Cook over medium heat for 6 to 8 minutes until the mixture thickens and coats the back of a rubber spatula.\nAdd half of the spice mixture to the caramel sauce along with the baking powder. Stir well to combine.\n4 Coat the popcorn with caramel: Immediately after making the caramel (don't let it get cold), pour it into the popcorn and peanut mixture. Work quickly and stir to combine and coat popcorn.\n5 Cool the popcorn: Spread popcorn out on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Use a rubber spatula to press the popcorn down into an even layer. Sprinkle popcorn with the remaining spice mixture.\nWhen the popcorn has cooled slightly, you can shape the popcorn into balls if you want, but I prefer it in freeform clusters. These popcorn clusters keep perfectly at room temperature in an airtight container for a few days, or probably up to a week.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nHow to Caramelize Onions\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 45 minutes\nQuantities depend on how much caramelized onions you wish to make. In this example, 5 large raw onions yielded about 2 cups caramelized onions.\nINGREDIENTS\nSeveral medium or large onions, yellow, white, or red\nExtra virgin olive oil\nButter (optional)\nSalt\nSugar (optional)\nBalsamic vinegar (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cut the onions root to tip: Slice 1/2-inch off the stem ends of the onions and the roots off of the root end. Place the onions cut side down on the cutting board. Cut them in half through the root end. Peel back the peels from the onions.\nLay the onions cut side down and make angled cuts into each onion, aimed at the center, cutting almost all the way, but not completely through the root end.  Make the cuts to your desired level of thickness.\nThe root end will help hold the onion together as you cut it, making it easier to cut. Then cut a V in the root end to cut out the tough root holding the slices together.\n2 Heat olive oil and butter, add onion slices: Use a wide, thick-bottomed saut\xc3\xa9 pan for maximum pan contact with the onions. Coat the bottom of the pan with olive oil, or a mixture of olive oil and butter (about 1 teaspoon per onion). Heat the pan on medium high heat until the oil is shimmering. Add the onion slices and stir to coat the onions with the oil. Spread the onions out evenly over the pan and let cook, stirring occasionally.\nDepending on how strong your stovetop burner is you may need to reduce the heat to medium or medium low to prevent the onions from burning or drying out.\nAfter 10 minutes, sprinkle some salt over the onions, and if you want, you can add some sugar to help with the caramelization process. (I add only about a teaspoon of sugar for 5 onions, you can add more.) One trick to keeping the onions from drying out as they cook is to add a little water to the pan.\n3 Cook, stirring every few minutes: Let cook for 30 minutes to an hour more, stirring every few minutes. As soon as the onions start sticking to the pan, let them stick a little and brown, but then stir them before they burn.\nThe trick is to leave them alone enough to brown (if you stir them too often, they won't brown), but not so long so that they burn. After the first 20 to 30 minutes you may want to lower the stove temperature a little, and add a little more oil, if you find the onions are verging on burning.\nA metal spatula will help you scrape up the browned bits from the bottom of the pan as the caramelization proceeds. As the onions cook down, you may find you need to scrape the pan every minute, instead of every few minutes.\nContinue to cook and scrape, cook and scrape, until the onions are a rich, browned color. At the end of the cooking process you might want to add a little balsamic vinegar or wine to help deglaze the pan and bring some additional flavor to the onions.\nStore refrigerated for several days in an air-tight container.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nFrench Onion Soup Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 10 minutesYield: Serves 4-6\nMuch of the success of this soup depends on the stock that you are using, and stock varies tremendously in its taste. Depending on your stock, you may need to bump up the flavor with some beef bouillon (we recommend "Better than Bouillon brand").\nTaste the soup before putting it in the oven, and if it needs more seasoning, don\'t be afraid to add more!\nINGREDIENTS\n6 large red or yellow onions (about 3 pounds), peeled and thinly sliced root to stem (see How to Slice an Onion), about 10 cups of sliced onions total\n4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons butter\n1 teaspoon of sugar\nSalt\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n8 cups of beef stock, chicken stock, or a combination of the two (traditionally the soup is made with beef stock)\n1/2 cup of dry vermouth or dry white wine\n2 bay leaves\n1 tablespoon (loose) of fresh thyme (can also use a few sprigs of fresh thyme) OR 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme (more to taste)\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n2 tablespoons brandy (optional)\n8 slices French bread or baguette cut 1-inch thick\n1 1/2 cups of grated Swiss Gruyere and a sprinkling of Parmesan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Caramelize the onions: In a 5 to 6 quart thick-bottomed pot, heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil on medium heat. Add the onions and toss to coat with the olive oil.\nCook the onions, stirring often, until they have softened, about 15 to 20 minutes.\nIncrease the heat to medium high. Add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and the butter and cook, stirring often, until the onions start to brown, about 15 more minutes.\nThen sprinkle with sugar (to help with the caramelization) and 1 teaspoon of salt and continue to cook until the onions are well browned, about 10 to 15 more minutes.\nAdd the minced garlic and cook for a minute more.\n2 Deglaze the pot with vermouth: Add the vermouth to the pot and scrape up the browned bits on the bottom and sides of the pot, deglazing the pot as you go.\n3 Add stock and seasonings: Add the stock, bay leaves, and thyme. Bring to a simmer, cover the pot and lower the heat to maintain a low simmer. Cook for about 30 minutes.\nSeason to taste with more salt and add freshly ground black pepper. Discard the bay leaves. Add brandy if using.\n4 Toast French bread slices: While the soup is simmering, line a sheet pan with parchment paper or foil and preheat the oven to 450\xc2\xb0F with a rack in the upper third of the oven.\nBrush both sides of the French bread or baguette slices lightly with olive oil (you\'ll end up using about a tablespoon and a half of olive oil for this).\nPut in the oven and toast until lightly browned, about 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven.\nTurn the toasts over and sprinkle with the grated Gruyere cheese and Parmesan. Return to oven when it\'s close to serving time and bake until the cheese is bubbly and lightly browned.\n5 Serve: To serve, ladle soup into a bowl and transfer one cheesy toast onto the top of each bowl of soup.\nAlternatively, you can use individual oven-proof bowls or one large casserole dish. Ladle the soup into the bowls or casserole dish. Cover with the toast and sprinkle with cheese. Put into the broiler for 10 minutes at 350\xc2\xb0 F, or until the cheese bubbles and is slightly browned.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nCaramelized Onion Quiche Recipe\nYield: Serves 6-8\nNote that although this recipe calls for making a pie crust from scratch, you can easily use an already prepared frozen pie crust. Just pre-bake it using the directions that follow.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 recipe pie dough (see P\xc3\xa2te Bris\xc3\xa9e recipe)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2-3 large red onions (about one pound total), French-cut (see below)\nSalt and freshly ground pepper\n2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar\n3/4 cup milk\n1/4 cup heavy cream\n3 large eggs\nPinch nutmeg\n6 ounces Gruy\xc3\xa8re cheese, grated (1 1/2 cups)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nSLICING ONIONS STEM TO ROOT\nTo caramelize onions, you\'ll want to slice them lengthwise, or from stem end to root end. That way the onions will hold their shape better during the long cooking involved in caramelizing. (See How to Slice an Onion for more details.)\n1 First, use a sharp knife, get a firm grip on the onion, and slice off the stem end of the onion, by about a 1/2 inch. Cut about 1/8th of an inch from the root end, cutting off the roots, but leaving the core intact. Then place the onion root side up on the board to stabilize it, and cut it in half, straight through the root end.\n\n2 Peel back the papery skin of the onions. If you want, to keep your cutting area clean, cut off the roots with the skins, but cut only enough to cut off the messy roots. Keep the root end intact. It will make it easier to slice the onion.\n\n3 With an onion half cut-side down on the board to stabilize it, make angled cuts into the onion, from stem end to root end, cutting to, but not through the root end. Work your way around the arc of the onion, aiming your knife\'s blade toward the center of the onion.\n4 Make a "V" cut in the root end of the onion to cut out the tough root end, to release the onion slices.\nPRE-BAKE THE CRUST\n1 Make a frozen tart crust: If you are making your own crust (instead of using an already prepared frozen crust), roll out your dough on a lightly floured surface, into a 12-inch circle. Fit into a 9-by-1 1/2-inch round tart pan (or 9-inch pie dish), pressing dough into corners, extending the edges extra high to allow for shrinkage. Transfer to freezer to chill for 30 minutes.\n2 Line frozen crust with foil and pie weights: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Line pastry with aluminum foil, pressing into the corners and edges, allowing extra foil on the sides (they\'ll be your handles when you remove the foil).\nFill at least two-thirds with baking weights\xe2\x80\x94dried beans, rice, copper pennies, or ceramic or metal pie weights.\n3 Bake with weights: Bake first for 15 minutes, remove from oven and let cool a few minutes. Carefully remove aluminum foil and weights.\n4 Remove weights and bake again: Poke the bottom of the pie pan with the tines of a fork and return to oven and bake an additional 10 minutes or until lightly golden. (Fork holes are for any air to escape.) Transfer to a wire rack to cool while making filling.\n  CARAMELIZING THE ONIONS AND PREPARING THE QUICHE\nThe onions will take about an hour to cook on the stovetop before they are ready to go into the quiche. So timing-wise, if you are making the entire quiche from scratch, it makes sense to get started on the onions once you\'ve put the crust into the freezer to chill before pre-baking.\n1 Caramelize the onions: Heat 2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. Add the onions and sprinkle a little salt over them. Cook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened and are translucent. Reduce the heat to medium low and cook for an additional 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are well browned. (See How to Caramelize Onions for more details.)\nAdd 2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar and cook for 10 minutes more, until onions are completely caramelized. Remove from heat.\n2 Assemble the quiche: Place tart pan on a baking sheet to catch any run-off there might be. Sprinkle half the cheese evenly over the bottom of the crust. Spread onions over the cheese and then top with remaining cheese.\nIn a medium bowl, whisk together milk, cream, and eggs. Season with nutmeg, salt, and pepper. Pour over the tart.\n3 Bake the quiche: Transfer to the 350\xc2\xb0F oven, and bake until just set in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool on a wire rack for about 10-15 minutes before slicing.\nHello!

Add the sliced fennel and onions and stir to coat. Stir occasionally.\nAfter about 10 minutes, sprinkle the onions and fennel with salt. Lower the temperature to medium.\nYou want to strike a balance between allowing the pan to get hot enough so that some caramelization (when the natural sugars in the onion and fennel start to brown) and keeping the pot from getting so hot that the onions and fennel dry out.\nIf it becomes an issue, you can add a couple tablespoons of water to the pan to help the onions and fennel to keep from drying out too much.\n2 Scrape up browned bits: Stir occasionally, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Note that the browned bits are the tastiest parts.\nCook for another 30 minutes to an hour, depending on how much of a hurry you're in, and how caramelized you want your mixture to be. The longer you cook, the more caramelized and browned.\nTaste test along the way to see if the cooking has been sufficient for your taste.\nBy the way, the onions and fennel will have plenty of flavor without having to be completely cooked down and browned all over.\n3 Toss with Parmesan, parsley, lemon: When ready to serve, remove from heat and toss in the freshly grated Parmesan cheese, the chopped parsley, lemon zest and lemon juice. Taste and add more lemon juice if necessary.\nServe alone as a side to chicken or seafood, or on crackers or thinly sliced toasted baguette for a crostini.

Cut the butter into the flour with your hands or with a pastry cutter, until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.\nAdd the sour cream and use a fork to incorporate it into the dough. Gather the dough into a ball and shape it into a disk. Wrap it with plastic wrap and chill for at least an hour.\n2 Peel and slice the onions, lengthwise from stem to root. (See How to Slice an Onion)\n3 Caramelize the onions: Heat olive oil and butter in a large, heavy-bottomed saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. Once the butter has melted, add the onions and sprinkle a little salt over them.\nCook, stirring occasionally for 10 minutes, until the onions have softened and are translucent.\nReduce the heat to medium low and cook for an additional 40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the onions are well browned.\nAdd balsamic vinegar and cook for 10 minutes more, until onions are completely caramelized. Remove from heat.\n4 Roll out the dough: Preheat the oven to 450\xc2\xb0F. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and let stand for 5 minutes before rolling it out.\nRoll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a 13-inch diameter. Transfer the crust dough to a cookie sheet lined with parchment paper.\n5 Layer the cheese and onions onto the dough: Place all but a couple tablespoons of the cheese in the center of the dough. Spread to within 1 1/2 inches from the edges. Add the caramelized onions, layering them on top of the cheese. Sprinkle with thyme.\n6 Pleat the edges: Fold the edges of the crust dough over so that a small circle of onion is still showing in the centre of the tart. Sprinkle the remaining cheese over the top of the tart.\n7 Bake: Place in the oven on the middle rack. Bake for 10 minutes at 450\xc2\xb0F. Reduce the heat to 350\xc2\xb0F and bake for an additional 20-25 minutes, until the crust is golden brown.\nRemove from oven and let sit for 10 minutes before serving.\nHello!

Add the sliced onions in one even layer, after five minutes add 1/2 tablespoon of butter, stir and add a pinch of kosher salt.\nWhile rendering your bacon and cooking your mushrooms in the next steps, make sure to stir the onions every few minutes and remove once they are evenly browned. This should take around 30 minutes, remove from heat when finished and reserve.\n2 Cook the bacon: While the onions are slowly cooking slice the bacon in small batonettes (1/8-inch crosswise strips) on your cutting board. Heat up a larger saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium and when your pan is hot add the sliced bacon.\nSlowly saut\xc3\xa9 the bacon until slightly crispy and remove from the pan onto a paper towel-lined plate, reserve for later.\n3 Cook mushrooms in rendered bacon fat: Julienne the shiitake mushrooms and then add them to the pan which now has the rendered bacon fat.\nAdd a pinch of salt and fresh cracked pepper to the Shiitake mushrooms, don\xe2\x80\x99t shake the pan but let the mushrooms brown evenly on one side.\nOnce browned, flip the mushrooms delicately and remove from pan onto a smaller plate, reserve.\n4 Brown the purple potatoes: Add 2 Tablespoons of olive oil in the pan and add the evenly sliced potatoes to the hot pan in a single layer; make sure not to crowd the pan. Add a pinch of red pepper flakes and a good pinch of salt to the potatoes.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t move the pan, this is very important so that the potatoes can evenly brown.\nAfter 3-5 minutes, when they are browned flip potatoes and brown the other side, turn down the heat to medium low to evenly cook the potatoes.\n5 Add capers, onions, mushrooms, bacon: Once the potatoes are thoroughly cooked, add the capers and let crisp up for a minute.

Sprinkle the chicken with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper.\nHeat the olive oil in the skillet over medium-high heat. When it is hot, add the chicken and cook without disturbing for 3 to 5 minutes, until the underside is golden. Turn and cook the other sides for 3 to 5 minutes more, until the other side is golden. Transfer chicken to a large plate.\n2 Cook the onion: Melt the butter in the skillet over medium heat. Add the onion, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Cook, stirring often, for 8 minutes, or until the onion starts to brown.\n3 Prep and cook the pears: While the onions cook, peel and core the pears. Cut into quarters (large pears can be cut into 6 pieces.)\nMove the onions to the center of the pan. Add the pears, cut sides down, around the edge. Cook for 4 minutes or until the pears brown on the bottom. Stir the onions occasionally.\nTurn the pears and cook the other cut sides for 3 minutes more. Stir the onions occasionally.\n4 Return the chicken to the skillet and glaze: Gently stir the pears and onions together and flatten them slightly to create a bed for the chicken. Place the chicken on top of the pears and onions. Tip in any pan juices from the plate into the skillet.\nIn a small bowl, stir together the maple syrup and mustard. Spread the glaze over the chicken breasts with a spoon.\n5 Bake the chicken: Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook for 20 to 25 minutes, or until the glaze is browned, the pears are tender when pierced, and the chicken is cooked through.

If it\xe2\x80\x99s an Instant Pot or similar model, the timer should default to a cooking time of 30 minutes. You will use every minute of this to saut\xc3\xa9 the onions.\n2 Add the fat and caramelize the onions: Add the butter or oil to the pressure cooker. Once the butter has melted or the oil shimmers, about 2 minutes, add the onions, sugar, and salt and stir with a wooden spoon, separating the onion layers and coating the slices with the fat.\nCover the pot with a tempered glass lid or other 9-inch pot lid and let the onions cook, without stirring, for 10 minutes.\n3 Uncover the pot and continue cooking the onions: Uncover the pot. At this point the onions should be softened, but not brown, and there should be some liquid at the bottom of the pot.\nWhile wearing an oven mitt, hold the rim of the inner pot in place, and stir the onions vigorously. Be careful not to splash hot liquid on yourself.\nContinue to stir the onions vigorously every 2 minutes, making sure to nudge loose any fond or brown bits from the bottom of the pot as it develops with your spoon. Do this until the saut\xc3\xa9 cooking program has ended after 30 minutes and the pot turns off automatically.\nAt this point, the onions should be caramelized and golden brown.\n3 Deglaze the pot and cook the soup under pressure: While the pot is off but still hot and the onions are sizzling, add the sherry. Use a wooden spoon to thoroughly scrape any remaining fond from the pot bottom.\nStir in the broth, Worcestershire, thyme, bay leaf, and pepper. Secure the pressure cooker lid in its sealing position, then select the manual setting, and set the time for 5 minutes at high pressure.\n(The pot will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure before the cooking program begins.)\n4 Release the pressure and prepare to serve: When the cooking program ends, let the pressure release naturally for at least 15 minutes, then move the pressure release valve to "venting" to release any remaining steam.\nAt this point, the soup will stay hot on the \xe2\x80\x9ckeep warm\xe2\x80\x9d setting for up to 10 hours, until you are ready to serve it.\nWhen you are ready to serve the soup, discard the bay leaf. Taste the soup for seasoning, adding salt and/or pepper if needed.\n5 Make the toasts and finish the soup: Preheat the broiler on your oven and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place broiler-safe serving bowls on the baking sheet, then ladle the soup into the bowls, filling them to about 1/2-inch from the top.\nSpread the baguette slices very sparingly with Dijon mustard (1/4 teaspoon per slice), then place the baguette slices on top of the bowls of soup.\nHeap a pile of the Gruyere cheese onto each baguette slice. Grind one or two grinds of black pepper on top of each slice. Broil for 3-5 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and beginning to brown.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nCaraway Soda Bread Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Makes one loaf\nINGREDIENTS\n3 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour (1 pound)\n1 Tbsp sugar\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n2 teaspoons caraway seeds\n4 Tbsp butter (1/2 stick) room temp\n1 1/2 cups buttermilk*\n*If necessary, you can substitute buttermilk with a half cup of plain yogurt mixed in with a cup of plain milk and a tablespoon of white vinegar.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 450\xc2\xb0F. In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, salt, baking soda, and caraway seeds.\n2 Using your fingers (or a fork) work the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.\n3 Make a well in the center of the flour. Pour the buttermilk into the center and using either your hands or a wooden spoon, fold the flour over the buttermilk and gently mix until just combined.\nThe dough should be neither too wet or too dry, so if it is a little too dry to work with, add a little more buttermilk. If too wet, add a little more flour. Roughly shape into a ball and place on a floured surface. Knead just a few times to shape it into a round loaf. Do not over-knead or the bread will be tough.\n4 Place dough loaf onto a lightly greased baking sheet (or cast iron pan). Make 1 1/2-inch deep cuts, forming a cross, from side to side on the loaf. The scoring helps the heat get to the center of the loaf while cooking.\n5 Place in oven, cook for 15 minutes at 450\xc2\xb0F, then lower the heat to 400\xc2\xb0F and cook for 25 more minutes. One way to test for doneness is to take it out of the oven, turn it over and knock on the bottom. If it sounds hollow, it's done. You can also use a skewer inserted into the center.\nLet bread sit on the baking sheet for 5-10 minutes to cool. Then remove it to a rack to cool a little bit longer. I think the bread is best when it is still warm and just baked. Quick breads like this, which rely on baking soda for leavening, are generally best eaten soon after they're baked.\nHello!

Thin chops you can take directly from the refrigerator. Thick chops should probably sit out for a bit before cooking.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 teaspoons bacon fat, butter or extra virgin olive oil\n1 large onion, sliced 1/4-inch, about 2 cups\n1/2 head of cabbage, sliced 1/4-inch wide slices\nSalt\n1/4 teaspoon celery seed\n1 teaspoon caraway seed\n1/2 cup stock (chicken, beef, or vegetable) or water\n1 tablespoon mustard, preferably Dijon\n1 tablespoon malt or cider vinegar\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon bacon fat or extra virgin olive oil\n4 pork chops\nMETHOD\n1 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions and cabbage: Heat the bacon fat (or butter or olive oil) in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium-high heat.\nAdd the onion and saut\xc3\xa9, stirring only occasionally, until the edges of the onions begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle salt over the onions as they cook.\nAdd the sliced cabbage and toss to combine. Cook for a minute or two, then add the celery seed, caraway, and stock. Cover and reduce the heat to low. Cook, covered for 10 minutes.\n2 Stir in mustard and vinegar: After 10 minutes, remove from heat, but leave the cover on the pan. Wait another 5 minutes, then uncover the pan and mix in the mustard and vinegar. Add salt and black pepper to taste.\n3 Cook the pork chops in a separate pan: As soon as you cover the cabbage pan in step 1, heat a tablespoon of bacon fat or oil in a cast iron frying pan on medium high heat. Pat the pork chops dry with paper towels. Sprinkle them with salt and lay them in the pan, working in batches if necessary as to not crowd the pan.\nTip: Place the chops in the pan so that the thickest, boniest parts are near the center of the pan where they get the most heat.\nAs soon as the chops are nicely browned on one side, about 2 minutes or so, flip them and sear them on the other side. If your pork chops are less than 3/4-inch thick, and you are using a cast iron pan, once the chops are seared on the second side, remove the pan from heat and let the chops sit in the hot pan until cooked through (you can use the finger test to check for the doneness of the meat). If you are not using a cast iron pan, just remove the pan from heat and cover the pan for a few minutes until the chops are done.\nIf your chops are thicker than 3/4-inch, and you are using a cast iron pan, remove the pan from heat and cover it, letting the chops finish cooking for about 5 minutes. If not using a cast iron pan, keep the chops covered on low heat for another 5 minutes after searing.\n4 Let chops rest, serve with cabbage: Remove the chops from the pan and let rest for 5 minutes. Serve alongside the cabbage.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

Cook for 90 seconds, then drain the pot of its water. Return the cabbage leaves to the pot.\n4 Melt butter, toss with cabbage, caraway, celery seeds, salt: Stir 4 tablespoons of butter into the cabbage. The cabbage and the pan are both hot, so the butter should melt quickly in the pan.\nIf you are using unsalted butter, you will want to add more salt to the cabbage. Start with half a teaspoon and add more if needed.\nSprinkle with caraway seeds, celery seeds, and black pepper, and toss to combine.\nServe immediately.

They are not cooked to the point of scrambled though, just enough to thicken the eggs into a sauce.\nThe garlic is optional. It is not usually included in pasta carbonara, but it tastes great so we\'ve included it. By the way, "guanciale", or pork jowl, is traditionally used in this dish, so if you can get it, by all means use it.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter\n1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced\n1-2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)\n3-4 whole eggs\n1 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese\n1 pound spaghetti pasta (or bucatini or fettuccine)\nSalt and black pepper to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat pasta water: Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water.)\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 pancetta/bacon and garlic: While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.\nAdd the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.\n3 Beat eggs and half of the cheese: In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.\n4 Cook pasta: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.\n5 Toss pasta with pancetta/bacon: When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.\nMove the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It\'s the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.\nToss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn\'t make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That\'s the tricky part.)\n6 Add the beaten egg mixture: Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.\nServe at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper.\nIf you want, sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nZucchini Pasta Carbonara Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 4\nThis recipe uses thinly sliced prosciutto, which works well with the more delicate flavor of the summer squash. But you could also use pancetta (diced), bacon (thin strips), or even thinly sliced ham.\n* To slice the basil leaves, chiffonade them by stacking basil leaves on top of each other, roll them up into a cigar shape, starting at one end and working your way down the "cigar" take thin slices from the end.\nINGREDIENTS\nSalt\n3/4 pound egg noodles\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon butter\n1/4 pound prosciutto, thinly sliced\n1 yellow onion, chopped\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n3-4 summer squash, yielding 4 cups chopped squash\nSalt and pepper\n4 eggs\n1 cup grated Parmesan cheese (plus more for topping)\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n1/2 cup basil leaves, sliced thin*\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the pasta cooking water: To cook the pasta, bring a large pot of water to a boil. Salt the water (one tablespoon of salt for 2 quarts of water).\n2 Brown the prosciutto: As the water for the pasta is heating, prep your vegetables and heat olive oil and butter on medium high in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan.\nWorking in batches, lay pieces of sliced prosciutto down in the pan. Fry gently on both sides until just lightly browned (no more than a minute, more likely 30 seconds each side, the prosciutto is very thin), remove from pan with tongs or a slotted spoon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain.\nOnce cool, tear into bite-sized pieces. Reserve oil in the pan.\n3 Add the pasta to the boiling water to cook: Add pasta to boiling salted water. The pasta should take about 10-12 minutes to cook until al dente (cooked but still a bit firm), which is just about the right amount of time you\'ll need to cook the vegetables. Cook with a rolling boil, uncovered.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions, garlic, summer squash: While the pasta is cooking, add the onions, garlic, and summer squash to the saut\xc3\xa9 pan that you had used to cook the prosciutto. The heat should be medium high.\nStir the vegetables so that they are all coated with oil from the pan, then spread them out in the pan, generously salt and pepper them. Cook until they are just lightly browned, stirring only occasionally. Remove from heat.\n5 Beat the eggs, add Parmesan and lemon zest: In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and mix in the grated Parmesan and lemon zest.\n6 Add cooked pasta to vegetables, stir in egg mixture: When the pasta is ready, reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking liquid, then drain the pasta. Add the pasta to the squash and onions (or add the veggies to the pasta, depending on the size of your pans).\nPour the egg, Parmesan, lemon zest mixture over the pasta mixture and quickly stir in with a wooden spoon. The heat from the pasta will sufficiently cook the eggs.\nAdd a little of the reserved pasta cooking water if it looks a little dry. Stir in the prosciutto and basil.\nGarnish with more basil and grated Parmesan.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

After the first two cups of flour gradually add more flour until a soft dough starts to form a ball and pull away from the sides of the bowl.\n3 Turn out onto a floured surface and knead dough for 7 to 10 minutes until smooth, OR use a dough hook in a stand-up mixer and knead the dough that way for 7 to 10 minutes, adding more flour as needed to keep the dough from being too sticky. Note that the dough should remain soft, so take care not to add too much flour.\nLet the Dough Rise:\n4 Place the dough in an oiled bowl, covered with a clean tea-towel or with plastic wrap. Let rise for an hour or until the dough has doubled in size.\nAt this point you can make a simple braided bread if you want (2 loaves), by punching the dough down, dividing the dough in half, and then dividing each half into three equal parts, rolling the dough pieces into ropes, braiding them, and tucking the ends under.\nOr you can get more fancy, which is what we've done here, with a filling, and forming the dough into a wreath shape. The following directions are for the wreath form.\nMake the Wreath Form:\n5 Press the dough down to deflate it a bit. Divide the dough into 2 equal parts. Take one part (saving the other for wreath number 2) and use your fingers to spread it into a 8-inch by 16-inch rectangle on a lightly floured, clean, flat surface.\nIf you are having difficulty getting the dough to keep its shape, just do what you can and let it sit for 5 minutes before trying again. Like pizza dough, the dough needs time to relax while you are forming it.\nBrush the dough with melted butter, leaving at least a half inch border on the edges so the dough will stick together when rolled. Mix together the brown and white sugar and the cinnamon and sprinkle the dough with half of the mixture (saving the other half for the second batch of dough).\nSprinkle on more fillings, as you like, such as raisins, slivered almonds, or almond paste. You could even sprinkle on some cream cheese for a creamier filling.\n6 Carefully roll the dough up lengthwise, with the seam on the bottom. Carefully transfer to a greased baking sheet. Form a circle with the dough on the baking sheet, connecting the ends together.\n7 Using scissors, cut most of the way through the dough, cutting on a slant. Work your way around the dough circle. After each cut, pull out the dough segment either to the right or to the left, alternating as you go around the circle. The dough circle will look like a wreath when you are done.\nRepeat steps 5, 7, and 8 with the rest of the dough, to form a second wreath.\nThe Second Rise:\n8 Cover lightly with plastic wrap and set in a warm area for a second rise. Let rise for about 40 minutes to an hour; the dough should again puff up in size.\nBake:\n9 Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Whisk together the egg yolks and cream. Use a pastry brush to brush over the dough. Bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes. After the first 15 minutes of baking, if the top is getting well browned, tent with some aluminum foil.\n10 Remove from oven and let cool completely. Whisk together powdered sugar and water to create a final glaze (optional). Add more water if the glaze is too thick to drizzle, add more powdered sugar if the glaze is too runny. Drizzle the glaze in a back and forth motion over the pastry.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nCardamom Honey Chicken Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 45 minutesMarinating time: 30 minutesYield: Serves 4\nIf a recipe calls for ground cardamom, it is best to start with whole pods. Break open the pods to release the tiny brown and black cardamom seeds. Use a spice grinder or mortar and pestle to grind the seeds.\nINGREDIENTS\nMarinade\n4 tablespoons honey\n2 tablespoons sherry\n1 teaspoon cardamom seeds, ground\n1 teaspoon peppercorns, ground\nChicken\n4 chicken breasts, skin-on, bone-in (cut in half if large), or one whole chicken, cut into parts\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 lemon, thinly sliced\nSalt and pepper\nMETHOD\n1 Marinate the chicken: Warm the honey slightly (in microwave or on stovetop), stir in the sherry, cardamom and peppercorns.\nPlace marinade and chicken in a large bowl, coat chicken with marinade. Cover with plastic wrap and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n2 Preheat oven to 390\xc2\xb0F (200\xc2\xb0C).\n3 Sear the chicken pieces: Heat olive oil in a large frying pan at medium heat. Sear the chicken for 20 to 30 seconds, skin side down, until golden. Watch carefully, since the chicken skin goes from browned to charred quickly.\n4 Bake in oven: Place lemon slices in a roasting pan. Lay the chicken pieces on top. Brush with the marinade. Season generously with salt and pepper. Cover loosely with foil.\nPlace in the oven and bake for 25 minutes. Remove foil and continue to bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer or until a thermometer registers 165\xc2\xb0F (75\xc2\xb0C) when inserted into the thickest part of the chicken.\nCheck often. If the chicken starts to get too dark (this can happen when using honey), tent with foil.\n5 Let rest: Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before serving. Pour out drippings from the pan into a gravy boat for gravy.\n6 Serve with rice, mashed potatoes, or couscous.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

If not, use regular curry powder and add the allspice to it. You will need at least 6 tablespoons of spices for this stew, and you can kick it up to 8-9 depending on how spicy you like it.\n2 Cut and salt the goat meat: Cut the meat into large chunks, maybe 2-3 inches across. If you have bones, you can use them, too. Salt everything well and set aside to come to room temperature for about 30 minutes.\n3 Heat the curry powder in oil: Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Mix in 2 tablespoons of the curry powder and heat until fragrant.\n4 Brown meat in curried oil: Pat the meat dry and brown well in the curried oil. Do this in batches and don\xe2\x80\x99t overcrowd the pot. It will take a while to do this, maybe 30 minutes or so. Set the browned meat aside in a bowl. (When all the meat is browned, if you have bones, add them and brown them, too.)\n5 Cook onions, habanero, ginger, garlic: Add the onions and habanero to the pot and saut\xc3\xa9, stirring from time to time, until the onions just start to brown, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle some salt over them as they cook. Add the ginger and garlic, mix well and saut\xc3\xa9 for another 1-2 minutes.\nPut the meat (and bones, if using) back into the pot, along with any juices left in the bowl. Mix well.\n6 Add coconut milk, tomatoes, curry powder, water, thyme, then simmer: Pour in the coconut milk and tomatoes and 5 tablespoons of the curry powder. Stir to combine. If you are using 2 cans of coconut milk, add 3 cups of water. If you\xe2\x80\x99re only using 1 can, add 4 cups of water. Add the thyme.\nBring to a simmer and let it cook until the meat is falling-apart tender, which will take at least 2 hours. Longer if you have a mature goat.\n7 Add potatoes: Once the meat is close to being done \xe2\x80\x93 tender but not falling apart yet \xe2\x80\x93 Add the potatoes and mix in. The stew is done when the potatoes are. Taste for salt and add some if it needs it.\n8 Skim fat: You might need to skim off the layer of fat at the top of the curry before serving. Do this with a large, shallow spoon, skimming into a bowl. Also, be sure to remove any bones before you serve the curry.\nThe stew is better the day after, or even several days after, the day you make it.\nServe with Jamaican rice and peas, a coconut rice with kidney beans.\nHello!

This is best achieved using an upright blender. If you use an immersion blender, just keep working at it until the soup is as smooth as you can make it.\nWe use chicken stock in this recipe, but you can easily use vegetable stock for a vegetarian option.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 tablespoons butter\n1 1/2 pounds carrots (6-7 large carrots), peeled and sliced thin\n2 cups chopped white or yellow onion\nSalt\n1 teaspoon minced ginger\n2 cups chicken stock or vegetable stock\n2 cups water\n3 large strips of zest from an orange\nChopped chives, parsley, dill or fennel for garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions and carrots: Melt the butter in a soup pot over medium heat and cook the onions and carrots, stirring occasionally, until the onions soften, about 5 to 8 minutes. Do not let the onions or carrots brown. Sprinkle a teaspoon of salt over the carrots and onions as they cook.\n2 Add stock and water, ginger, and strips of orange zest. Bring to a simmer, cover, and cook until the carrots soften, about 20 minutes.\n3 Remove the strips of orange zest! It's easy to forget this step, and if you forget and pur\xc3\xa9e the soup with the strips of zest still in it, the soup may be too bitter for your taste.\n4 Pur\xc3\xa9e soup: Pur\xc3\xa9e the soup with a stick blender, or working in small batches, pour the soup into a blender and pur\xc3\xa9e until completely smooth. Only fill the blender bowl a third full with the hot liquid and keep one hand pressing down on the cap of the blender to keep it from popping off.\nAdd more salt to taste.

Then cut 1/4-inch thick slices lengthwise. Stack the slices and cut them again into 1/4-inch thick batons.\n2 Massage with salt and sugar: Place the carrots and daikon radishes in a large bowl. Sprinkle with 4 teaspoons of sugar and 2 teaspoons of salt. Use your clean hands to toss the carrots and daikon with the salt and sugar until well coated.\nContinue to mix the carrots and daikon with your hands until they begin to soften, about 3 minutes. They are ready once you can bend a piece of daikon all the way over without it breaking.\n3 Rinse: Transfer the carrots and daikon to a colander, rinse with cool water and drain well.\n4 Make vinegar sugar mixture: In a bowl (a 8 cup pyrex measuring cup works great for this) mix together one cup of sugar, the white vinegar and the warm water, until the sugar dissolves.\n5 Pour vinegar mixture over carrots and daikon in jars: Prepare clean jars. Pack the daikon and carrots tightly into the jars. Pour over the pickling liquid to cover. Seal. Refrigerate.\nThe pickles should sit at least overnight before eating; their flavor will improve with time. They should last 4 to 6 weeks in the refrigerator.\nHello!

When it is all in, move the blender to its highest setting and puree for about 90 seconds.\n2 Shred the root vegetables: Peel all the vegetables except for the radishes, if you are using black ones. The slivers of black in the salad look cool, so I leave them in.\nUsing a vegetable peeler or a coarse grater, slice shreds off the vegetables into a bowl. Try to keep the shreds roughly the same length if you can.\n3 Toss shredded vegetables with vinaigrette: To finish, toss some of the vinaigrette with the shredded vegetables and let stand in the fridge for at least 20 minutes before serving.\nHello!

Jalape\xc3\xb1os vary in heat and sometimes you need more, sometimes less to get the desired heat level. If you want to take it up a notch in heat, leave in more of the seeds.\nUse gloves when handling jalape\xc3\xb1os (or a plastic sandwich bag), or coat your hands with a little oil first, before cutting the peppers, and then wash hands with warm soap and water after.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup roasted (salted or unsalted) cashew nuts\n6 Tbsp roughly chopped cilantro (leaves and stems)\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped\n2 tablespoons soy sauce (use gluten-free for gluten-free version)\n2 teaspoons brown sugar\n1 to 2 jalape\xc3\xb1o peppers, stems and most seeds discarded, roughly chopped\n1 Tbsp lime juice, plus lime wedges for garnish\nKosher salt and freshly ground black pepper\n3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the spicy cashew paste: In a food processor or blender, add the cashews, cilantro, olive oil, garlic, soy sauce, brown sugar, jalape\xc3\xb1o, lime juice, and 2 tablespoons of water.\nPulse or blend until the mixture is a smooth paste. Add salt and pepper to taste.\nReserve a third of the marinade for serving with the chicken. Use the rest for coating the chicken.\n2 Coat chicken with the cashew paste: Sprinkle the chicken thighs all over with salt and pepper. Coat the chicken pieces with the marinade.\nAt this point if you want, you can make ahead, and chill for several hours or overnight until ready to cook. Bring to room temperature before cooking.\n3 Grill or broil the chicken: Preheat broiler or prepare grill (or grill pan) for medium direct heat.\nBroil or grill chicken, turning frequently, until golden and crisp and a meat thermometer reads 165\xc2\xb0F when inserted into the thickest part of the thigh (not touching a bone), or when the juices run clear (not pink) when cut into with a knife.\nThis will take about 25 to 35 minutes for a grill on medium heat, or about 10-20 minutes under a broiler, depending on how far the chicken is from the heat.\nNote that as you turn the pieces, some of the coating will fall off. It's to be expected, so don't worry if and when this happens.\nServe with lime wedges, reserved marinade, and cilantro.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

The sturdy yellow corn tortillas will have more flavor, and hold up better in this casserole, but they do require "softening" or cooking in a little oil before layering. If you use tender white corn tortillas, you may not need to soften them.\nINGREDIENTS\nExtra virgin olive oil\n1 1/4 pounds ground beef or ground turkey\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 tablespoon chili powder\n1 tablespoon ground cumin\n1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne\n1 14-oz can refried pinto beans (or you can make your own refried beans)\n2 medium onions, chopped (about 2 1/2 cups)\n1 red bell pepper, stem and seeds removed, chopped (about 1 cup)\n3 garlic cloves, peeled and minced\n1 28-oz can crushed or diced tomatoes, preferably "Fire Roasted"\n1 7-oz can diced green Anaheim chiles\n1/2 teaspoon dried oregano\n12 (6-inch) corn tortillas (choose sturdy tortillas mad with yellow corn)\n2 cups coarsely grated Monterey Jack cheese (about 8 oz)\n2 cups coarsely grated mild cheddar cheese (about 8 oz)\nTo serve:\nSour cream\nAvocado\nCilantro\nIceberg lettuce\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the ground beef: Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan or cast iron frying pan on medium high heat. Add the ground meat, breaking it up as you add it.\nSprinkle with salt. Sprinkle on the chile powder, cayenne, cumin, and coriander. Increase the heat to high. Add another 2 tablespoons of olive oil.\nDo not stir the meat unnecessarily. Allow the meat to brown on one side, and then stir it so the other side can be browned.\nAs soon as the meat is browned, remove the pan from the burner. The meat will continue to cook in the heat of the pan.\nOnce you are sure that the meat is cooked through, use a slotted spoon to remove the meat from the pan to a bowl. Set aside.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions, bell peppers, garlic, add tomatoes, chiles, oregano: Add another tablespoon of olive oil to the empty pan used to cook the meat and set over medium heat.\nAdd the onions and chopped bell peppers. Cook until onions have softened, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic, cook for an additional 1 minute.\nAdd the diced tomatoes, green chiles and oregano. Bring to a simmer. Simmer gently for 15-20 minutes while you prepare the tortillas.\n3 Cook the tortillas: While the sauce is simmering, soften the tortillas by frying them in a little oil. In a 9-inch skillet, heat 1/2 cup olive oil on medium high heat until it is sizzling hot, but not smoking.\nCook the tortillas one at a time, for 5 seconds on each side, so that they soften, but don\'t get crisp.\nRemove the tortillas with a metal spatula or tongs and place on a plate lined with paper towels to soak up the excess oil.\n4 Preheat oven: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F and lightly oil a 9x13-inch glass or ceramic baking dish.\n5 Assemble the casserole: In baking dish, arrange 4 tortillas in one layer, overlapping slightly (tortillas will not cover bottom completely).\n(If you don\'t have time to pre-soften the tortillas, coat the bottom of the pan with some olive oil and spread a little sauce over the bottom before adding the tortillas.)\nSpread half of bean mixture evenly over tortillas in dish and top with half of meat mixture. Sprinkle one third cheese over the meat and spread half of the sauce over the cheese.\nRepeat layering of tortillas, beans, meat, cheese, and sauce and top with remaining 4 tortillas. Sprinkle remaining cheese over tortillas.\n6 Bake: Bake casserole on the middle rack in the oven at 350\xc2\xb0F for 35 minutes, until the casserole is heated through and the cheese is completely melted and bubbling.\n7 Cool and serve: Let the casserole stand for 10-15 minutes before serving.\nServe with sour cream, chopped avocado, chopped cilantro, and thinly sliced iceberg lettuce on which has been sprinkled vinegar and salt.\nHello!

Ultimately, you need enough bread to cover the bottom of your baking dish. If you're bread isn't pre-sliced, you might need more to do this.\nTake the remaining 2 slices of bread and pulse in a food processor until fine crumbs are formed.\n3 Chop the meat and the cheese: Chop the pastrami (or corned beef if you\xe2\x80\x99re using) into bite sized pieces. I do this by stacking it and cutting the meat first in strips, then I cut across the strips to form rough squares. It doesn\xe2\x80\x99t need to be perfect.

Cover with at least an inch of cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes).\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 vegetables: While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the butter in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 6 to 10 minutes.\nIf you are including vegetables, add them according to their cooking time. Carrots should be cooked with the onions, because they take as long to cook as the onions do.\nIf you are including peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook, as they take very little cooking time.\n3 Add the ground beef, then Worcestershire sauce and broth: Add ground beef to the pan with the onions and vegetables. Cook until no longer pink. Season with salt and pepper.\nAdd the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out.\n4 Mash the cooked potatoes: When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with the remaining 4 Tbsp of butter. Mash with a fork or potato masher, and season with salt and pepper to taste.\n5 Layer the meat mixture and mashed potatoes in a casserole dish: Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. Spread the beef, onions, and vegetables (if using) in an even layer in a large baking dish (9x13 casserole).\nSpread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef. Rough up the surface of the mashed potatoes with a fork so there are peaks that will get well browned. You can even use a fork to make creative designs in the mashed potatoes.\n6 Bake in oven: Place in a 400\xc2\xb0F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil for the last few minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown.\n(Be careful when broiling using Pyrex or glass dishes, they have been known to shatter under the high heat of the broiler. It's not a worry if you are using a ceramic or metal casserole dish.)\nSuggested variations:\nPut a layer of creamed corn between the ground beef and the mashed potatoes.\nSprinkle grated cheddar cheese over the top of the mashed potatoes before baking.\nHello!

Either slice the sausage into rounds or remove the casing from the sausage by slicing lengthwise down the side and cook it like ground sausage.\nWhen the oil shimmers, add the sausage to the pan, and cook for about 6 minutes or until browned. Use a cooking utensil to break the sausage up as you cook it. Transfer to a plate.\n2 Snip the tomatoes: Open the can of tomatoes and use a large pair of scissors to snip and break them up in the can into chunky pieces. You will mash them a little more in the skillet.\n3 Make the sauce: In the same skillet you used to brown the sausage, heat 1 tablespoon oil over medium heat. Add the sliced garlic and oregano. Cook for 30 seconds, or until the garlic sizzles. Add the tomatoes with their juices, salt, and sugar. Bring to a simmer and cook for 2 to 3 minutes or until the sauce is hot.\nUse a potato masher to break up the tomatoes into smaller pieces (this is easiest to do when tomatoes soften in the heat). You are aiming for a chunky sauce.\nAdd the sausage back to the pan and cook for 10 minutes. Taste, and add more salt and sugar, if you like.\n4 Make the ricotta mixture: Meanwhile, in a small bowl, stir the egg, ricotta, Parmesan, nutmeg, and pepper together.\n5 Preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. Brush or spray a 4x8-inch loaf pan with oil.\n6 Assemble the lasagna: In the bottom of the loaf pan, ladle about 1/2 cup tomato-sausage sauce. Top with 1 noodle. Spread with 1/2 cup sauce, and then spread 1/3 mounded cup of the ricotta mixture over it.\nPlace a second noodle on top of the sauce. Spread 1/3 mounded cup ricotta mixture over it, and top with 1/2 cup tomato-sausage sauce.\nPlace a third noodle on top of the sauce. Spread with remaining ricotta and spoon 1/2 cup tomato-sausage sauce over it, using up all of the remaining sausage pieces in this layer.\nPlace a fourth noodle on top of the sauce and spoon the remaining sauce on top. Sprinkle with the mozzarella.\n6 Bake the lasagna: Place the loaf pan on a baking sheet. Fold a large piece of foil in half and fold it in half again. Make a tent over the loaf pan (so it does not stick to the cheese.) Bake for 25 minutes.\nRemove the pan from the oven and remove the foil tent. Check to see if the lasagna is uneven or if it peaks in the middle. If it\xe2\x80\x99s uneven, use the back of a spoon to press the top layer lightly to make it level in the loaf pan and submerge the noodles in the sauce.\nTurn the oven down to 375\xc2\xb0F. Return lasagna to the oven and continue to bake for 15 minutes, or until the sauce bubbles and the cheese is golden brown. (If you like stretchy rather than browned cheese, check after 10 minutes.)\n7 To serve: Allow the lasagna to rest for 10 minutes before serving. Sprinkle with chopped parsley, if you like.\nHello!

b'Print\nBiscuits and Gravy Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesCook time: 35 minutesYield: 12 servings\nThe cornstarch in the biscuit dough reduces the gluten content to help keep the biscuits light and fluffy.\nIf you have White Lily Flour, use 2 1/2 cups of White Lily flour instead of all-purpose, and omit the cornstarch.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the biscuits:\n2 1/4 cups (315 g) all-purpose flour (see Recipe Note)\n3 tablespoons cornstarch\n1 tablespoon baking powder\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 cup unsalted butter, cold\n1 cup buttermilk, cold\nFor the gravy:\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1/2 pound sliced mushrooms\n1/4 cup chopped yellow onions\n1 pound breakfast pork sausage\n6 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon ground sage\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/8 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n2 1/2 cups milk, preferably whole\nFor topping:\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted\nSpecial equipment:\n2-quart glass or ceramic baking dish, rectangular or square\n2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Make the biscuit dough: Combine the flour, cornstarch, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Cut the butter into 1/2-inch chunks and sprinkle it over the dry ingredients. Using a pastry blender, a butter knife, or a fork, cut the butter into the dry ingredients until most of it is the size of peas. Don\xe2\x80\x99t overwork it; you want to leave some of the butter in chunks.\nAdd the buttermilk and toss the mixture with a spatula until it starts to look shaggy, and most of the buttermilk has been absorbed. It won\xe2\x80\x99t form a dough yet; that\xe2\x80\x99s OK.\n3 Bring the dough together: Turn out the contents of the bowl onto a clean surface dusted with a little flour. Gather the dough together with your hands into a mound, then roll it out until it is about 10-inches wide. Again, don\xe2\x80\x99t worry if the dough is crumbly!\n4 Fold the dough to create flaky layers: Use a spatula (like the kind you use to make fried eggs) or bench scraper and flip 1/3 of the dough over from the left to the center. Then flip the other side over that side. You\xe2\x80\x99re basically folding the dough over like a letter.\nRotate the dough 90-degrees and roll it out again to about a 10-inch square. It will start to feel more like a dough and less crumbly at this point, but there will still be some loose chunks. Just press them back into the dough if they fall out, and resist the urge to add more liquid.\nRepeat the process of rolling out and folding two more times. By the fourth time, the biscuit dough will hold together and feel like actual dough.\n5 Cut the biscuits: Roll out the dough to a 10-inch square that\xe2\x80\x99s roughly 1/2 inch thick. Using a 2 1/2-inch biscuit cutter, cut out 16 circles. When you press down to cut out the dough, don\xe2\x80\x99t twist the biscuit cutter, which will \xe2\x80\x9cseal\xe2\x80\x9d the edges of the dough. Instead, just cut straight down, so the biscuit will rise and be as flaky as possible.\n5 Bake the bottom layer of biscuits: Set aside 12 of the biscuit rounds. Place the remaining 4 biscuit rounds on the bottom of a 2-quart glass or ceramic casserole dish. Cut up the remaining scraps of dough and jigsaw-puzzle the remaining dough into the bottom of the casserole dish, making sure to cover the bottom in a single layer.\nPlace on a rimmed baking sheet (for ease of removal from the oven and to catch any drips). Bake in the oven for 15 minutes or until the top of the biscuits start to look dry but not brown at all. (There might be a slight darkening around the edges, but don\xe2\x80\x99t be alarmed if the biscuits still look pale white.)\n6 Meanwhile, make the gravy: While the bottom biscuits are baking, make the gravy by placing the oil, mushrooms, and onions in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan. Cook on high heat, stirring constantly, until the mushrooms start to soften, and the onions start to look translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the sausage, breaking it up with a wooden spoon or spatula, and cook until the sausage starts to brown, about 5 minutes.\nKeep the heat on high, and add the flour, sage, black pepper, nutmeg, and salt to the pan. Stir until the ingredients are absorbed. Pour in the milk, reduce heat to medium, and cook, continuing to stir until the liquid has started to bubble and thicken, about 3 to 7 minutes. You\xe2\x80\x99re now ready to assemble the casserole!\nIf the first layer of biscuits isn\xe2\x80\x99t done baking, lower the heat on the gravy to a simmer until the biscuits are done. If you still need time to finish the gravy, but the biscuits are done\xe2\x80\x94remove the casserole dish from the oven, and let it sit on the counter or stovetop while you finish the gravy.\n7 Assemble and bake the casserole: Once the gravy has thickened and the first layer of biscuits is done baking, pour or spoon the gravy over the biscuit layer in the casserole dish. Place the 12 reserved biscuits over the gravy and brush the top of the biscuits with the melted butter.\nReturn the dish to the oven and bake until the biscuits are golden brown and the gravy is bubbling and thick, about 18 to 23 minutes.\n8 Cool and serve: Let cool 10 minutes before serving warm from the casserole dish.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nFrench Toast Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 40 minutesChill time: overnight (optional)Yield: 6 to 8 servings\nMake-ahead instructions: Assemble the casserole through Step 4, cover well, and refrigerate overnight. The next day, uncover, drizzle the casserole with the topping, and bake. Baking time will be slightly longer.\nThis casserole reheats well, though the chunks of bread on the top will gradually lose some crunch. The best way to reheat it is to bake it in the oven at 350F for 10 to 15 minutes to warm through and re-crisp the top.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the casserole:\n1 large loaf good-quality French loaf, sourdough, ciabatta, or challah (enough to yield 10 cups of chunks of bread)\n1/2 cup (45g) chopped pecans\n5 large eggs\n1 1/2 cups whole milk\n1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar\nZest from one medium orange (optional)\n1/2 teaspoons ground cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon salt\nFor the topping:\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\n3 tablespoons (40g) dark brown sugar\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\nPinch of salt\nOptional toppings for serving:\nDried cranberries\nPowdered sugar\nMaple syrup\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 375F (190C). Place an oven rack in the center position.\n2 Slice the bread into 1-inch slices and then cut them into 1-inch cubes. You can also tear the bread apart with your hands. Leave the crusts on.\n3 Layer the bread and pecans in a baking dish: Lightly grease a 2-quart (if you want thicker slices) or 3-quart baking dish (if you want thinner slices) with cooking spray or butter. Add enough bread cubes to cover the bottom. Sprinkle a few tablespoons of pecans on top. Continue layering the bread chunks and pecans.\n4 Prepare and add the custard: In a small bowl, whisk the eggs together. Add the milk, sugar, orange zest, 1/2 teaspoon of cinnamon, and salt, and mix well. Pour the egg and milk mixture evenly over all the bread chunks. (I found it easier to pour the mixture into a large measuring cup with a spout first before pouring the mixture over the bread.)\nAt this point, the casserole can be baked right away, or covered and refrigerated overnight.\n5 Drizzle with topping: In another bowl, mix the melted butter with the brown sugar, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and a pinch of salt. Using a spoon, drizzle the mixture evenly over all the bread chunks.\n6 Bake the casserole for 35 to 45 minutes. I baked mine for about 38 minutes. Leave the casserole in the oven longer if you want the chunks of bread on the top to be more brown and crunchier.\n7 Remove the casserole from the oven and let it cool for about 10 minutes before serving.

b"Save It Print\nBeef Noodle Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 8\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 medium white onion, peeled and chopped, about 1 1/2 cups\n1 bell pepper, seeded, ribs removed, finely chopped, about 1 cup\n3 cloves garlic, minced, about 1 tablespoon\n1 28-ounce can whole peeled or crushed tomatoes\n1 1/2 pounds ground beef\nSalt\n4 ounces mushrooms, sliced\n12 ounces egg noodles\n1 1/2 cups frozen corn, defrosted\n1 15-ounce can of black olives, strained and chopped\n8 ounces cheddar cheese, grated\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven and start heating water: Pre-heat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F and start to heat a large pot of salted water (1 Tbsp salt, 2 quarts water) for cooking the egg noodles.\n2 Make tomato sauce base: Heat 1 Tbsp of oil on medium high heat in a large, heavy bottomed pot or skillet. Add the onions and bell pepper and saut\xc3\xa9 until softened, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and cook for a minute more.\nAdd the tomatoes, breaking them up with your fingers or a knife if you are using whole canned tomatoes. Bring to a simmer and let cook for 10 minutes. Lower the heat to warm.\n3 Brown the ground beef: In a separate skillet, add 1 Tbsp of oil and heat to medium-high. Working in batches, so you do not crowd the pan, add the ground beef, breaking it up with your fingers as you add it to the pan.\nDo not stir the ground beef, but let it sit and cook for a minute or two until it browns on one side.\nSprinkle a little salt over the meat while cooking.\nOnce browned on one side, turn the pieces over to get the other side browned. Once the meat is mostly browned (can still be rare in the center), remove the beef from the pan and add to the tomato onion mixture.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 the mushrooms: Add the mushrooms to the same pan that you had used for browning the beef, and saut\xc3\xa9 the mushrooms in the remaining oil and beef drippings. Once browned, add the mushrooms to the beef and tomato mixture.\n5 Cook the egg noodles: While the mushrooms are cooking, add the egg noodle pasta to the boiling water. Cook as directed, about 4-5 minutes. Strain when cooked, but still a little firm (al dente).\n6 Add everything to casserole dish: Add the cooked egg noodles to a large  (3 quart) casserole dish. (If your casserole dish isn't big enough, you may need to use 2 casserole dishes.)\nStir in the tomato beef mixture. Stir in the corn, chopped olives, and about two thirds of the cheese.\n7 Bake: Sprinkle remaining cheese on top of casserole. Place in the oven. Bake uncovered at 350\xc2\xb0F for 30 minutes.\nHello!

b'Print\nVegetarian Spinach and Mushroom Lasagna Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 45 minutesYield: Serves 8-10\nThe first thing I do to start making this recipe is to get a big pot of salted water heating for the pasta, and defrost the spinach. While this is happening you can prep the mushrooms and cheeses.\nUse high quality tomato sauce for best results.\nIf fresh basil is not available for layering in the casserole, add 2 teaspoons of dried basil to the sauce.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the sauce:\n1 1/2 pound cremini mushrooms, roughly chopped\n1/2 pound shiitake mushrooms, roughly chopped\nSalt\n1 generous cup chopped onions\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil plus more for keeping the noodles from sticking to each other\n4 cloves garlic, chopped (about 4 teaspoons)\n1 (6-ounce) can tomato paste\n2 cups tomato sauce\n1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes (such as Muir Glen with basil)\n1 cup water\n1 tablespoon dried thyme\n1/2 teaspoon red pepper flakes\n1 tablespoon sugar\nFor the lasagna:\n2 (10-ounce) boxes frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed in clean towel of excess moisture\n1 pound lasagna noodles (16 to 20 noodles)\n1 (15-or-16-ounce) container of ricotta cheese\n1/4 cup chopped fresh basil\n1/4 pound pecorino cheese (or Parmesan), grated (about 1 cup)\n1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese (about 4 cups)\nSpecial equipment:\n 1 large casserole pan, preferably 10x15-inches\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Saut\xc3\xa9 the mushrooms: Place mushrooms in a large (6 to 8 quart) saut\xc3\xa9 pan on high or medium high heat. Stir them with a wooden spoon or shake the pan from time to time. You may hear them squeak.\nSprinkle salt over the mushrooms. The mushrooms will sizzle and then start to release water. (Note that you are not adding fat at this point to the pan; this method of cooking mushrooms in their own moisture is called "dry saut\xc3\xa9ing.)\nOnce the mushrooms start to release water into the pan, stir in the chopped onions. Cook until the mushrooms are no longer releasing moisture and the mushroom water has boiled away, about 5 minutes more.\n2 Make the sauce: Add the olive oil to the mushrooms and stir to coat. Saut\xc3\xa9 the mushrooms and onions for about a minute. Add the garlic and cook for another minute.\nStir in the tomato paste, cook for a minute longer. Reserve 1 cup of the tomato sauce (it will go in the bottom of the casserole dish), and put the remaining cup of tomato sauce into the pot with the mushrooms.  Add the large can of crushed tomatoes and one cup of water.\nStir in the thyme, sugar, and red pepper flakes. (If you are using dried basil instead of fresh, add it now.) Bring to a simmer, then lower the heat and simmer on a low simmer, for 20 minutes.\n3 Boil and drain the lasagna noodles: Once the sauce is simmering, salt the boiling pasta water, and add the dry lasagna noodles to the boiling water.  (The water should be at a vigorous, rolling boil.) Stir gently, making sure that the noodles are not sticking to each other. Set the timer for 8 minutes, or however long is indicated on the package of the noodles. Cook uncovered on a high boil.\nWhen the noodles are ready (al dente, cooked through but still firm to the bite), drain the noodles in a colander, and rinse them to cool them with cold water.  As you rinse them, gently separate them with your fingers so they don\'t stick to each other.\nPrepare a couple large cookie sheets or baking sheets by spreading a tablespoon of olive oil over the baking sheets.\nPlace the lasagna noodles on the sheets, gently coating them with a bit of that olive oil, and spreading them out. This will help keep them from sticking to each other while you finish the sauce and prepare the layered casserole.\n4 Assemble the lasagna: Turn off the heat on the stovetop for the sauce. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\nSpread the one cup of reserved tomato sauce over the bottom of a large (preferably 10x15-inch) casserole dish. (If your casserole dish is smaller, you may need to add another layer as you go through this step.)\nPlace a layer of lasagna noodles down over the tomato sauce, slightly overlapping. (For our 10x15-inch dish, we ultimately fit 3 layers of 6 noodles each, with 2 extra noodles on which to nosh.)\nSprinkle half of the ricotta cheese over the noodles, and half of the defrosted, drained, and squeezed out spinach over the ricotta.\nSprinkle half of the mozzarella cheese over the spinach, and just a quarter of the pecorino cheese.\nThen spoon 1/3 of your mushroom sauce over the mozzarella. Sprinkle half of the fresh basil over the sauce.\n5 Repeat layers: Repeat the layering process. Place a second layer of noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining ricotta, spinach, and mozzarella over the noodles. Sprinkle another quarter of the pecorino along with the mozzarella. Top with another third of the mushroom sauce and the remaining fresh basil.\nLayer your final layer of lasagna noodles over the sauce. Spread the remaining sauce over the lasagna noodles, and sprinkle with the remaining pecorino or parmesan cheese.\n6 Cover with foil and bake: Pull out a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to cover the casserole dish. Spread a little olive oil over the inside of the piece of foil (the side that will have contact with the lasagna). Place the foil over the casserole dish and crimp the edges.\nBake at 350\xc2\xb0F for 25 minutes, then remove the foil and bake uncovered for an additional 25 minutes.\nTake the lasagna out of the oven when done and let it rest 10 minutes before cutting to serve. Once made, the lasagna will last a week in the fridge.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'
b'Print\nBroccoli Cheddar Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 55 minutesYield: Serves 5 as a main course, 10 as a side\nPrep your ingredients while you are heating the blanching water to save time.\nSave your broccoli stems! You can use vegetable peeler to peel them, then slice and eat like celery.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds (900g) broccoli, stems removed (can use vegetable peeler to peel, then slice and eat like celery) and crowns cut into florets (about 8 cups of broccoli florets)\n2 strips thick-cut bacon (about 2 ounces), cut crosswise into 1/4-inch wide strips\n5 large eggs, beaten\n1/3 cup (43g) all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup (118 ml) heavy cream\n1 cup (236 ml) whole milk\n2 to 3 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper (1 to 2 teaspoons if using fine ground black pepper)\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\n8 ounces (225g) cheddar cheese, grated\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Blanch the broccoli florets: Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (1 Tbsp salt for 2 quarts of water). Add the broccoli florets and boil for 3-5 minutes or until just tender enough so that a fork can easily pierce the floret, but still firm. Strain and rinse with cold water to stop the cooking.\n2 Cook the bacon: While the water in step one is coming to a boil, cook the bacon pieces on medium heat in a frying pan until lightly browned, but not crisp. Remove to a plate lined with paper towels to absorb the excess fat. Set aside.\n3 Make the egg mixture: Preheat oven to 425\xc2\xb0F (220\xc2\xb0C). Butter a 2 1/2 quart casserole dish. In a bowl, whisk the eggs into the flour, then whisk in the cream and milk. Add the black pepper (more or less to taste), salt, and mustard. Mix in about a third of the cheese.\n4 Assemble the casserole: Place the blanched broccoli florets in the casserole dish, sprinkling about a third of the cheese over the broccoli florets as you lay them down. Sprinkle the bacon pieces over the broccoli.\nPour the egg, cream, milk, cheese mixture over the broccoli, moving the broccoli pieces a bit so that the mixture gets into all the nooks and crannies. Sprinkle the casserole with the remaining cheese.\n5 Bake for 25 to 40 minutes, or until set. Once the top has browned, you may want to tent with aluminum foil to keep from burning.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nSausage Breakfast Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 6 to 8\nBread that is a little bit dry will hold up better in the casserole and provide more structure, which is why breakfast casseroles tend to call for "day old" bread. If your bread is fresh or soft, after you cube it, spread it out on a sheet pan and put it in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 to 12 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Italian pork sausage\n10 large eggs, beaten\n4 cups whole milk\n1 teaspoon dry mustard\n1/4 teaspoon onion powder\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\nFresh ground pepper to taste\n5 cups cubed day old bread (we recommend rustic French or Italian loaf), cut into 3/4-inch to 1 inch-wide cubes\n2 cups shredded sharp cheddar cheese\n1/2 cup sliced mushrooms (optional)\n1/2 cup peeled, cored, chopped tomatoes (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brown the sausage: Heat a skillet on medium. Break up the sausage into chunks and cook, working in batches if need be, until cooked on all sides. As you cook the sausage, you can break up the larger chunks into smaller crumbles (which are easier to distribute evenly over the casserole).\nWhen lightly browned, remove from pan to a paper towel lined plate to absorb any excess fat.\n2 In a large bowl whisk together the eggs, milk, dry mustard, onion powder, salt and pepper.\n3 Assemble the casserole: Place the cubed bread in a well-buttered 9x13 inch baking pan. Sprinkle with cheese. Sprinkle with chopped tomatoes and mushrooms, if using. Top with the browned crumbled sausage, distributing it evenly. Pour the egg milk mixture evenly over the bread and cheese.\n4 Cover and chill, if making ahead: At this point, the casserole can be covered and chilled in the fridge until ready to bake and serve, up to overnight.\nIf baking immediately, let the casserole sit for 10 minutes before putting in the oven (to give the bread a chance to absorb the milk-egg mixture.\n5 Bake the casserole: When ready to cook, preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xb0F. Bake uncovered for about one hour. Tent with foil if the top begins to brown too quickly.\n6 Serve: Let the casserole cool for about 10 minutes before serving. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for about a week.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Lightly grease a 10x10 casserole dish (for a thicker pastel\xc3\xb3n) or 9x13 casserole dish (for a thinner pastel\xc3\xb3n) with nonstick cooking spray or butter.\n2 Prepare the plantains: Cut off both ends from the plantain, then use the tip of your knife to cut a slit down the back. Using your two thumbs, remove the peel from the plantain and discard the peel.\nOnce you\xe2\x80\x99ve peeled all the plantains, slice each one in half down the length. Separate the two halves and flip them onto their flat sides to create a stable base. Place your palm flat on top of the plantain, and use a sharp knife to slice parallel to the cutting board and cut the plantains into very thin slices (about 1/4-inch thick). Set aside.\n(Alternatively, you can use a mandoline to slice the plantains thinly, but be careful because the plantains are soft and the mandoline is sharp!)\n  3 Fry the plantains: In a large skillet, heat the vegetable oil to 300\xc2\xb0F over medium heat (check the temperature with a candy thermometer or instant-read thermometer). Line a plate with paper towels to drain the plantains after frying, and set next to the stove.\nPlace four or five slices of plantains into the oil and fry for about 1 1/2 minutes on each side, or until the plantains have a browned slightly. Remove from the skillet to the paper-lined plate to drain. Continue frying the remaining plantains.\n4 Cook the beef: Drain all but 1 tablespoon of oil from the pan you used to fry the plantains. Return the pan to the stove and heat over medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and season with the adobo and saz\xc3\xb3n.\nContinue to cook the meat, breaking it up into crumbles, for 6 minutes or until browned. Drain the meat by pouring it into a colander, but leave a bit of the grease in the pan to cook the vegetables.\n5 Cook the vegetables: Return the empty pan to the heat and cook the onions, bell pepper, and recaito for 3 minutes or until glossy. Add the olives, capers, and dried oregano, and cook for 2 more minutes.\n6 Finish the filling: Return the ground beef to the pan with the vegetables, along with the tomato sauce, and then stir to combine. Bring the mixture to a simmer, then remove the pan from the heat.\n7 Assemble the pastel\xc3\xb3n: Cover the bottom of the casserole dish with a single layer of the fried plantain strips. Spoon a 1-inch layer of the ground beef mixture onto the plantains. Top with 1/2 cup of shredded cheese. Repeat with another layer of plantains, meat, and cheese (reserve the remaining 1 cup of cheese). Top with a final layer of plantains.\n   8 Add the egg layer: In a small bowl, whisk together the eggs and baking soda until frothy. Pour this mixture over the plantains.\n9 Bake the pastel\xc3\xb3n, uncovered, for 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and top with the remaining cup of cheese. Return the dish to the oven and cook for an additional five minutes, until the cheese has melted.\n10 Cool and serve: Remove the pastel\xc3\xb3n from the oven. Allow it to cool for at least fifteen minutes before slicing and serving, which helps it maintain its shape when sliced.\nLeftovers can be stored, covered, in the refrigerator for up to three days. To reheat, cut a portion and place either in the microwave or the oven until warmed through.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. If you are using whole canned tomatoes, break them up as you add them to the sauce.\n4 Add milk and season with sea salt. Then turn down the heat and let simmer for 2 and 1/2 hours. Stir at least every 20 minutes. Whenever the sauce simmers down to the point that it is sticking to the bottom of the pan, just add 1/4 cup of water and scrape up the browned bits from the bottom and continue to cook.\nMAKE THE B\xc3\x89CHAMEL SAUCE\n5 Make the roux: Heat the milk until almost boiling in a heavy bottomed sauce pan.\nIn a separate pan melt the unsalted butter with the flour over low heat. Stir rapidly with a spoon. Cook this for 1 minute and then remove from the heat.

See above for more detailed freezing and reheating instructions.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 to 5 pounds potatoes (russets, yukon gold or a combination), peeled and cut into 2-inch chunks\nSalt\n3 garlic cloves, peeled and whole\n1 small sprig fresh rosemary\n3 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided 2 tablespoons and 1 tablespoon\n8 ounces cream cheese (full fat), room temperature\n1/2 cup plain or greek yogurt (or sour cream)\n1/4 teaspoon fresh minced rosemary\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\nChives for garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the potatoes: Place peeled cut potatoes in a large saucepan, cover with an inch of cold water. Add 2 teaspoons of salt to the water. Add the garlic cloves and rosemary sprig.\nHeat on high to bring to a boil, then reduce to low, cover to maintain a simmer until the potatoes are just cooked through, about 10 to 12 minutes.\nOnce potatoes are done, drain the potatoes. Discard the rosemary sprig, save the garlic cloves with the potatoes.\n2 Mash the potatoes and garlic cloves: While the potatoes are still hot, use either a potato masher or a potato ricer to roughly mash the potatoes and the garlic cloves in a large bowl.\nA ricer will yield fluffier, less gluey, mashed potatoes.\n3 Mix in cream cheese and yogurt: In a large upright mixer (or if you have strong arms, you can do this by hand), add the riced or roughly mashed potatoes into the mixer bowl, along with 2 tablespoons of butter, the softened cream cheese, and the yogurt.\nMix on low to start, then increase the speed to medium and mix just until everything is well incorporated.

b"Save It Print\nChile Relleno Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 15 minutesYield: Serves 8\nFeel free to play around with the stuffing, Mexican chorizo is great for this, but we've also used hot Louisiana pork sausage. Or you can skip the pork all together and just use a jack cheese stuffing. Note that this casserole serves 8; you can easily cut the ingredients in half and use an 8x8 dish for the casserole.\nINGREDIENTS\n8 poblano chiles\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 cup chopped onion\n4 cloves garlic, minced (about 4 teaspoons)\n1 28-ounce can tomatoes\nSalt\n1 pound Mexican chorizo (or other spicy sausage)\n1 cup Cotija cheese, crumbled (can sub feta)\n1 teaspoon fresh oregano, minced\nOne dozen eggs\n1/3 cup flour\n1 teaspoon baking powder\n1 1/2 cup Monterey jack or mild cheddar cheese, shredded\nSpecial equipment:\nA 9x13-inch baking dish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Char the whole poblano chiles: The first step is to char the outside skin of the poblano chiles. The easiest way to do that is directly over the flame of a gas burner (see How to Roast Chiles over a Gas Flame).\nYou can also do that over a grill, or in a broiling pan under a broiler (don't use a thin baking sheet or it will warp under the high heat). Just put the chiles close enough to the heating element so they char and blister on the surface.\nTurn the chiles so that they get completely blackened all around. Place the blackened chiles in a bowl and cover with a plate or damp towel. Let the chiles steam in their own heat for several minutes.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 onion, garlic, add tomatoes, salt, and simmer: While the chilies are cooling, heat olive oil in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan, on medium high heat. Add the chopped onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a minute more.\nAdd the tomatoes (break up any whole tomatoes before adding to the pan). Add a pinch of salt. Bring to a simmer and lower the heat to low. Gently simmer for 15-20 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.\n3 Peel the blackened skin off the poblanos: Carefully peel and discard the blackened skin off of the chilies. Cut off the stem ends. Carefully remove the seed pod without tearing the chiles (which you will stuff later).\n4 Cook the chorizo: Put the Mexican chorizo in a large frying pan and set the heat to medium high. Break up the chorizo with the edge of a metal spatula as you cook it. Cook until cooked through, about 4 minutes.\n5 Spread tomato sauce over bottom of baking dish: Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xb0F. Spread the tomato sauce over the bottom of an 9x13 inch baking dish. The tomato sauce should be the consistency of a thin spaghetti sauce. If it is too thick, thin it out with a little water.\n6 Make stuffing: In a large bowl, mix together the stuffing of the cooked chorizo, cotija, and oregano.\n7 Stuff chiles with chorizo mixture and place on top of tomato sauce in the baking dish.\n8 Whisk eggs, flour, baking powder, salt: In a large bowl, vigorously whisk the eggs. Whisk in the flour, baking powder, and a pinch of salt.\n9 Sprinkle chiles with cheese and pour egg mixture over them: Sprinkle chiles with half of the jack or cheddar cheese. Pour egg mixture over chiles and sprinkle with remaining cheese.\nAt this point you can make ahead and chill for several days. Add 10 minutes to cooking time in the next step if you make ahead and chill.\n10 Bake: Bake at 375\xc2\xb0F until top starts to brown and the eggs are set but still soft, about 30 minutes.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nChicken and Rice Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 10 minutesYield: Serves 6 (with leftovers)\nThis recipe assumes the rice requires about 1 1/2 cups liquid per cup of rice to cook. Some rice varieties, such as brown rice, require more liquid (and a longer cooking time). Adjust recipe accordingly.\nIf you are avoiding cooking with alcohol, skip the sherry and deglaze the pan with a 1/4 cup extra of chicken stock.\nDepending on how salted your stock is, you may need to more generously salt this dish. You can always salt to taste at the table.\nStovetop Method: To cook the casserole on the stovetop use a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan with a tight cover, cook on low when all is assembled. Cook it low enough to keep a simmer, but not so high that you burn the rice.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 to 1 1/2 inch pieces, patted dry\nSalt and pepper\n4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 medium onion, chopped\n2 cloves garlic, minced\n1/2 pound cremini or button mushrooms, sliced\n1/4 cup dry sherry or white wine\n1 1/3 cups chicken stock (See Recipe Note)\n1/2 cup sour cream\n1/4 cup cream\n1 cup uncooked white rice, medium or long grain\n1 1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon each of Italian seasoning and poultry seasoning (or 2 teaspoons of one of these herb mixes, or 2 tablespoons chopped fresh herbs such as rosemary, sage, thyme, and basil)\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley\nSpecial equipment:\n9 x 13-inch casserole dish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Brown the chicken: Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium high or high heat (hot enough to brown but not burn). Season the chicken pieces all over with salt and pepper.\nWorking in batches, brown the chicken pieces on both sides, about 1 to 2 minutes per batch. Add a little more olive oil if needed with every batch.\nRemove chicken pieces and set aside in a bowl. The chicken does not have to be cooked through, only browned.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions and garlic: In the same saut\xc3\xa9 pan add 1 tablespoon olive oil. Lower the heat to medium, add the onions, and cook until translucent, about 3 minutes.\nAdd the garlic; cook 30 seconds more. Remove onions and garlic to a shallow 9x13 casserole dish.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 the mushrooms: Raise heat to medium high and add the sliced mushrooms. Dry saut\xc3\xa9 the mushrooms (don't add butter or oil), allowing them to brown lightly and release some of their moisture. Add the mushrooms to the casserole dish.\n5 Make the sauce: Add 1/4 cup dry sherry or dry white wine to the pan to deglaze it, scraping off the browned bits from the bottom.\n(At this point, if you are making ahead, reduce the sherry to 1 tablespoon and pour off into the casserole dish.

b"Save It Print\nSlow Cooker Chicken and Rice Casserole Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 2 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6\nThe basmati rice we are using in this recipe usually needs 3 cups of liquid for 2 cups of rice. For this recipe we are only adding 1 1/2 cups of liquid because the chicken and other ingredients will release moisture while the casserole cooks.\nIf you are using rice that requires a different amount of liquid to cook, you'll need to experiment for the right amount of liquid to reduce.\nAlso, different slow cookers come to temperature at different rates, and have tighter or looser lids. So you will likely need to experiment with the timing as well as the amount of liquid. Your slow cooker may require adding more liquid to keep the rice from drying out.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (or 1 1/2 pounds boneless, skin-on chicken thighs)\nKosher salt\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n4 cups sliced yellow onion, 1/4-inch thick slices, sliced root to tip (about 2 large onions)\n1 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n4 teaspoons finely chopped garlic (about 4 cloves)\n2 cups raw basmati long grain rice\n1 cup diced canned (or fresh) tomatoes\n1/2 cup frozen peas (optional)\n1 1/2 cups chicken stock\n3/4 teaspoon black pepper\n2 bay leaves\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart slow cooker, preferably with a metal insert\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Salt the chicken: Sprinkle salt (about 2 teaspoons) on both side of the chicken thighs, and let them sit while you prep and cook the onions.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions, garlic, spices: Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on high heat. When the oil is shimmery hot, but not smoking, add the sliced onions and cook until lightly browned, stirring frequently, about 6 minutes.\nLower the heat to medium and stir in the ground cumin and cinnamon. Let cook for a minute. Add the garlic and cook for half a minute more. Place cooked onions and garlic into the bowl of a slow cooker. (Do not wipe down the saut\xc3\xa9 pan.)\n3 Brown the chicken thighs: Heat the saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium. Add the chicken thighs, skin-side-down in the pan. Let cook on medium heat until the skin is well-browned and much of the chicken fat from the skin has rendered out (about 10 to 12 minutes).\nTurn the chicken pieces over and brown the skinless side for 4 to 5 minutes more.\n4 Combine everything in the slow cooker: While the chicken is cooking, add the raw long grain rice into the slow cooker with the onions, stir to combine. Stir in the diced tomatoes, peas (if using), stock, pepper, bay leaves. Stir in 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt.\nWhen the chicken has finished browning, place the chicken pieces skin-side up in the pot.\n5 Slow cook for 2 to 3 hours on the high setting of your slow cooker. The timing depends on your particular slow cooker. My All-Clad model with a metal bowl heats up very quickly and only takes 2 hours to cook this dish. Slow cooker models with a ceramic bowl heat up much more slowly and probably would take 3 hours to cook.\nI suggest checking about halfway through the cooking time to see how the rice is cooking. If it is drying out (could be your lid isn't tight fitting, or the rice just needs more water), add another half cup to cup of water.\nFluff the rice with a fork to serve. Add more salt to taste.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"

Butter an 8x8 baking dish.\n2 Parboil the potatoes: Scrub the potatoes clean, but leave the skins on. Place them in a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil. Allow to boil for about 10 minutes.\nTurn off heat and let the potatoes sit in the hot water for another 10 minutes. When ready, you should be able to pierce the potatoes with a fork, but still feel slight resistance. Drain the potatoes and set aside until cool enough to handle.\nIf making the potatoes ahead, cool to room temp, cover, and store in fridge for up to 3 days.\n3 Meanwhile, cook the onions and peppers: In a medium skillet, melt 5 tablespoons butter, cook the onions and bell pepper until the onions are soft and translucent, about 6 minutes. Set aside.\n4 Peel and shred the potatoes: Once the potatoes are cool enough to handle, score them along their equator with a paring knife. Twist each side in opposite directions to remove skin. The skin should pull off easily. If any bits of skin remain, trim them off with a knife.\nShred the potatoes using a food processor fitted with the shredder disk, or shred them by hand using the large holes on a cheese grater.\n5 Assemble the casserole: Transfer shredded potatoes to a large bowl, and mix with the cooked onions, pepper, cream of chicken soup, cheddar cheese, sour cream, 1 teaspoon of salt, and pepper.\nStir until thoroughly combined. Spread into casserole dish.\n6 Toast the breadcrumbs: In the same pan where you cooked the onions, melt remaining 3 tablespoons of butter over medium heat. Add the panko and remaining 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Stir to coat.\nToast panko, stirring frequently, until it takes on a golden hue, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle evenly over the top of the potatoes.\n7 Bake at 350\xc2\xb0F for 45 minutes. When done, the potatoes should be bubbling around the edges, and the panko top will be golden.  \n8 Cool for 10 minutes, then spoon onto plates.  \nHello!

I like to cut the bagel in half (from top to bottom) and then cut each half into fourths. Try to cut the bagel into pieces that are no larger than an inch.\n3 Make the egg mix and combine with the bagels: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the eggs, half-and-half, salt, and pepper until no yolk is visible and the mixture is smooth.\nAdd the cut bagels to the egg mixture and, using a large spoon or spatula, toss to coat the bread in the liquid. Set this to the side to allow the bread to soak while you brown the sausage.\n3 Cook the sausage, onion, and pepper: Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer (this should take about a minute).\nAdd the breakfast sausage to the pan and begin to brown it. Break up the sausage into small chunks with a wooden spoon until the sausage is about the size of pistachios. It should not look minced.\nOnce the sausage has cooked through and browned (about 5 minutes), create a well in the center of the pan using your spoon. Add the diced peppers and the onions. Stir them with the sausage and cook the mixture for an additional 3 to 4 minutes, or until the veggies are glossy and soft.\nDrain any excess fat by straining the mixture in a colander, then allow the mixture to cool for 5 minutes. This is a great time to shred your cheese if you haven\xe2\x80\x99t already.\n4 Combine the sausage, bagel and egg mixture. Once your sausage mix has cooled slightly, add it to the bagel and egg mixture. Add 1 tablespoon of the parsley and 2 cups of the cheddar cheese. Toss the ingredients together to combine evenly.\n5 Assemble the casserole: Pour the mixture into the prepared casserole dish and cover with aluminum foil.\nMake-ahead step: At this point, you can place the dish into the refrigerator overnight and bake in the morning. Once you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to bake, remove the casserole dish twenty minutes prior to baking, then proceed as follows.\n6 Bake the casserole: Bake, covered with foil, in the preheated oven for 20 minutes and then carefully remove the pan from the oven and remove the foil.\nReturn the pan to the oven and bake for an additional 25 minutes or until the middle is no longer jiggling, and the surface has browned.\n7 Cool and serve: Remove the pan from the oven and immediately top with the remaining cheese and parsley.

b'Save It Print\nCauliflower Gratin Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: Serves 6\nINGREDIENTS\n1 head cauliflower, cored, broken into bite-sized florets (see How to Cut and Core Cauliflower)\n2 medium-small leeks, cleaned, halved lengthwise, sliced into 1/4-in thick slices, white and light green parts only, about 2 cups\n2 Tbsp butter\n2 Tbsp all purpose flour\n1 1/3 cups milk\n4 ounces Gruyere cheese, grated\n1 teaspoon minced fresh thyme or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme\n1/8 teaspoon grated nutmeg\n1 teaspoon salt\nPepper\nTopping:\n1 1/2 cups fresh breadcrumbs (3 slices of sandwich bread or rustic bread, pulsed in a food processor)\n1 Tbsp butter\n1/4 teaspoon salt\nPepper\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the leeks: Melt butter on medium heat in a medium sized saucepan. Add the sliced leeks and gently cook until completely softened, about 8 to 10 minutes.\n2 Lightly steam the cauliflower: While the leeks are cooking, place cauliflower florets in a steamer basket in a saucepan over an inch of water. Bring water to a boil, cover, and steam the cauliflower for 3 to 4 minutes.\nThe steaming should just take the rawness out of the cauliflower, but not cook it so much that it is tender. You want the cauliflower at this stage to be al dente. Remove strainer and cauliflower from hot pan and set aside.\n3 Make roux with butter, leeks, flour, add milk: Add 2 Tbsp of flour to the leeks and butter. Stir and let cook for a minute or two. Slowly add the milk, stirring as you add it to break up any lumps. Bring to a low simmer and continue to stir as the sauce thickens.\n4 Stir in cheese, thyme, nutmeg, salt: Once the sauce is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon, stir in 3 ounces of the shredded cheese (reserving the rest of the cheese for the topping), the thyme, nutmeg, and salt.\n5 Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F.\n6 Pour sauce over cauliflower in gratin dish: Spread a teaspoon of butter over the insides of a 2-quart gratin dish. Place the lightly steamed cauliflower florets in an even layer in the dish. Pour the leek and cheese sauce over the cauliflower. Top with remaining cheese.\n7 Bake at 400\xc2\xb0F for 25 minutes.\n8 Toast breadcrumbs: While the gratin is baking, melt 1 Tbsp of butter in a small saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium high heat. Add the fresh breadcrumbs and toast in the melted butter for 4 to 5 minutes, until lightly browned. Sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon of salt, and a sprinkling of pepper. Remove from heat.\n9 Top gratin with toasted breadcrumbs and bake: After the gratin has baked for 25 minutes, remove it from the oven.

If you are working with a cauliflower that is larger or smaller than 1 1/4 pounds, increase or decrease the amount of butter and sour cream to add.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 large cauliflower (about 1 1/4 pound or 565 g), core removed, cut into large florets (see How to Cut and Core Cauliflower)\n1 cup (235 ml) water\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 tablespoons butter\n4 tablespoons (60 ml) sour cream\nChopped chives, green onions, and/or parsley for garnish\nSalt and pepper to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Steam/boil the cauliflower: Place 1 cup water in a medium saucepan. Add 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add the cauliflower florets.\nBring to a boil on high heat. Lower the heat to a simmer.\nCover and let the cauliflower cook for 10-14 minutes, until very tender.\n2 Brown the butter: While the cauliflower is cooking, melt the butter in a small saucepan (easier to use a stainless steel pan so that you can see the browning occur) on medium heat.\nOnce the butter melts, it will begin to foam up a bit. When the foam subsides, look for amber colored bits forming at the bottom of the pan.\nWhen the butter begins to brown, smell it. It will have a lovely nutty aroma.\nWhen you can see lots of flecks of browned bits, and the melted butter smells wonderful, remove it from the heat and pour into a bowl (glass or metal).\nButter can quickly go from browned to burnt, so keep an eye on it and work quickly when the butter starts to brown! (See our more detailed instructions on How to Brown Butter.)\n3 Strain the cooked cauliflower: When the cauliflower is cooked through and tender enough to mash with a fork, strain out all but a tablespoon or two of the remaining water.\n4 Mash with a potato masher and stir in the brown butter and sour cream. (Make sure to scrape in all the browned bits from the butter; that's where the flavor is!)\n5 Pur\xc3\xa9e to desired consistency: Use an immersion blender or a standing blender and blend the mashed potatoes to as smooth a consistency as you would like. Or just mash more with a potato masher if you like a chunky consistency.\nAdd salt and pepper to taste. Top with chopped chives, green onions, or parsley to serve.\n  Hello!

Add 2 teaspoons of salt to the water.\nAdd the cauliflower florets, and cook until cooked through, about 4 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to remove florets to a bowl. Reserve cooking water.\n2 Pur\xc3\xa9e cooked cauliflower: Working in batches, fill a blender half-way with cooked cauliflower, add enough cooking water to the blender bowl so that it comes up a quarter of the way. Pur\xc3\xa9e until smooth. You want the consistency to be that of soup, so if you need to add more water, do so.\n3 Add salt and butter: or each blender batch, add salt and butter to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and about a tablespoon or more of butter for each blender batch). Since you are using only lightly salted cooking water for a base, not stock, you will need to salt this more than you would otherwise.\n4 Serve: Serve immediately into bowls.

Scoop out and reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water.\nDrain the pasta in a colander.\n6 Assemble the casserole: Return the drained pasta to the pot and immediately stir in 1/2 cup of Parmesan while the pasta is still hot. Once the cheese has melted and absorbed into the pasta a little, stir in the milk.\nAdd the roasted cauliflower and onion, lemon zest, thyme and Gouda, and stir well. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if you like. If the mixture seems dry, add a little pasta cooking water, a tablespoon at a time.\nTransfer to a 3- or 4-quart baking dish.\n7 Top with the crispy cracker crumbs: Place the crackers in a zip-top bag and crush with a rolling pin until coarsely crumbled.\nIn a bowl, mix the crushed crackers with 2 tablespoons Parmesan, the melted butter and parsley. Sprinkle this evenly over the pasta.\n8 Bake the pasta: Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the pasta is hot and the top is golden.\n9 Cool briefly and serve.

b'Print\nCelery, Blue Cheese and Hazelnut Salad Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4-8\nTo save time, start by roasting the hazelnuts. While they roast, you can prep all the other ingredients. Celery bunches come in different sizes, so the amounts here are a little inexact. Just make sure you have enough blue cheese so that you get a little with every bite of the celery.\nINGREDIENTS\n6 ounces good quality blue cheese\n3/4 cup hazelnuts\n1 tablespoon butter\n3 tablespoons maple Syrup\nPinch of cayenne\nSalt\n2-3 bunches of celery, tops removed\n12-15 pitted dates (can sub with a handful of dried cranberries or cherries)\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil (or hazelnut oil if you happen to have it)\n1 teaspoon lemon zest\n4 teaspoons lemon juice (if using Meyer lemons, use 2 Tbsp)\nFreshly ground black pepper\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Remove cheese from refrigerator to come to room temperature.\n2 Roast hazelnuts: Place hazelnuts on a rimmed baking sheet in a 300\xc2\xb0F oven for 30 minutes.\n3 Prep celery and dates: While the nuts are roasting, prepare the other ingredients. Use a vegetable peeler to peel away the tough outer strings of the stalks of celery. Slice the celery stalks on the diagonal into 1/4-inch thick slices.\nSlice the dates lengthwise first in half, then slice the halves lengthwise into 3 or four pieces. If the dates are on the large size, you may want to slice them in half widthwise first. You want to end up with pieces that are about an inch long and a 1/4 inch wide.\n4 Rub outer skin off hazelnuts: Once the hazelnuts have roasted for half an hour, remove them from the oven, let cool for a few minutes. Then rub the hazelnuts together inside of a clean dish towel to remove as much of the outer dark skin as you can.\n5 Glaze hazelnuts: Melt butter in a small skillet. Add a pinch of cayenne and salt. Add the roasted hazelnuts to the pan and toast them on medium low heat for a few minutes, continuously stirring.\nWhen the hazelnuts are hot, turn off the heat and add maple syrup to the pan. Stir to coat the hazelnuts in the maple syrup.\nLet glazed nuts sit in the pan to cool. Later you will scrape them loose with a wooden spoon and serve atop the salad.\n6 Prepare the salad dressing: In a small jar, mix together the olive oil, lemon zest, and lemon juice. Add salt and black pepper to taste. Shake to combine.\n7 Assemble salad: Layer a shallow platter or dish first with the sliced celery, then dates, then crumble the blue cheese over it and sprinkle with glazed hazelnuts. Right before serving, pour dressing over top.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'

b'Save It Print\nRabbit Braised in Belgian Ale Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 15 minutesYield: Serves 4\nMany markets carry whole frozen rabbits. Call ahead to have your butcher defrost and cut rabbit into parts. Otherwise, defrost by by placing into a large bowl of cool water. Once thawed, cut into parts (see these instructions). Try to remove any stray little bones at the edges of some of the cuts of rabbit.\nThe dish works best with a Belgian ale. If not available, try Newcastle brown ale or Anchor Steam ale, or O-Doule amber ale if you need to avoid alcohol. Do not attempt this recipe with a hoppy beer.\nINGREDIENTS\nOne 2 1/2 to 3 pound rabbit, cut into 6 to 7 serving pieces (2 front legs, 2 back legs, the loin cut into 2 to 3 pieces), plus ribs and flap meat\nSalt\n1/2 cup all purpose flour for dredging\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons butter\n2 medium onions, sliced stem to root (about 2 1/2 cups sliced)\n4-6 whole cloves of garlic, peeled\n6 sprigs of fresh thyme, tied together with kitchen string (or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme)\n1 1/2 cups of Belgian ale, such as Chimay or Ommengang\n1/2 cup of chicken stock\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 celery root, peeled and diced\n2 teaspoons whole grained mustard\n2 teaspoons brown sugar\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Sprinkle rabbit pieces with salt: Place rabbit pieces on a platter, sprinkle both sides with kosher salt. Let sit for 30 minutes to an hour.\n2 Dredge rabbit with flour, brown in butter: Place flour on plate. Dredge rabbit pieces in flour.\nHeat oil and butter in a large  Dutch oven on medium heat (large enough to fit rabbit pieces in a single layer). Once the butter is melted and foamy, add the rabbit pieces in a single layer to the pot.\nBrown on one side without stirring for 5 to 6 minutes. Then turn the pieces over and brown on the other side. Remove to a plate.\n3 Brown the onions, add garlic and thyme: Add the sliced onions to the pot, and cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly brown, scraping up and browned rabbit bits from the bottom of the pot. Add garlic cloves and thyme, cook until onions are soft and the garlic quite fragrant.\n4 Add ale, then stock, salt, pepper: Increase the heat to high and add the Belgian ale. Let it simmer for a minute or two, then add the stock. Add a half teaspoon of salt and the freshly ground black pepper.\n5 Add celery root, rabbit, then simmer: Place the diced celery root over the onions in a single layer. Place the browned rabbit pieces over the  celery root. Bring to a simmer. Cover and reduce heat to maintain a very low simmer. Cook for 45 minutes, or until the rabbit is just cooked through and tender.\n6 Reduce sauce: Remove rabbit pieces from the pot and keep warm on a platter. Increase the heat to high and reduce the liquid by one third. Then, reduce the heat to low, stir in the mustard and sugar. Taste and add more salt and pepper in needed.\n7 Return meat to sauce in pot: Slice the flap meat pieces of the rabbit into strips and return to the pot. Strip away any available meat from the back and chest parts and return meat to the pot. Add the serving pieces to the pot. Cover and let rewarm for a minute.\n8 Serve: Sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve. Serve with crusty bread, egg noodles, or rice pilaf, along with some Belgian ale.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nCelery Root Fennel Soup Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nThe one challenge of making celery root soup is peeling the celery roots, which with their nobby-ness can be difficult. Use a sharp chef's knife to cut off the ends of the root. Then stand the root upright on a cutting board and use downward slices to cut the remaining peel off the the root. Then cut the roots in half, place the halves cut side down on the cutting board, and thinly slice them.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 Tbsp butter\n2 cups thinly sliced onions (sliced across the grain)\n4 cloves garlic, sliced\n2 medium fennel bulbs, thinly sliced\n2 medium celery roots (about 1 1/2 pounds), peeled and thinly sliced (See TheKitchn's guide to peeling celery root)\n1 medium russet potato, peeled and thinly sliced\n2 bay leaves\n7 cups chicken stock\n2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt (less or more to taste)\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n1/4 cup whipping cream\nFennel fronds for garnish\nMETHOD\n1 Cook onions: Melt butter in a large (6-8 quart) thick-bottomed pot on medium high heat.

b"Save It Print\nCream Of Celeriac Soup with Brussels Sprouts Chips Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: Serves 8 as a starter, 6 as a main course\nEditor's Note: Celeriac, or celery root, is the large, bulbous root of a particular type of celery plant. It has a flavor similar to celery, but more intense and earthy. Look for it near the other root vegetables in the produce section at the grocery store.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the Brussels sprouts chips:\n10 brussels sprouts\n1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil\n1/8 teaspoon natural salt, plus more to taste\nFor the soup:\n2 tablespoons grapeseed oil or extra-virgin olive oil\n2 cups diced yellow onion\n2 teaspoons minced garlic (from 2 whole cloves)\n1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste\n1 medium head cauliflower, cut into florets (See How to Cut and Core Cauliflower)\n3 cups peeled and diced celeriac (from 1 large root)\n8 cups vegetable broth, plus more as needed\n1/4 cup blanched slivered almonds\n1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, plus more to taste\nSpecial equipment:\nBlender\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the Brussels sprouts chips: Heat the oven to 350F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone liner.\nSlice the bottom tip of each sprout, and peel off the outer leaves. Trim off a bit more of the bottom, and peel off the next layer of leaves. Continue this process until you've removed all of the leaves.\nToss the leaves with the olive oil and salt, and spread them out in a single layer on the baking sheet. Roast for about 10 minutes, until the leaves are browned and crisp.\nSet aside until needed.\n2 While the Brussels sprouts are roasting, start the soup: In a large saucepan, warm the oil over medium heat and saute\xcc\x81 the onion, garlic, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt for about 5 minutes, until the onions are soft and translucent. Add the cauliflower and celeriac, and saute\xcc\x81 for another minute.\n3 Add the broth and simmer: Add the vegetable broth and 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, increase the heat to high, and bring just to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium-high and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, until the cauliflower and celeriac are just tender.\n4 Remove the saucepan from the heat and stir in the almonds: Allow the soup to cool slightly for 10 minutes. (This gives the nuts time to soften.)\n5 Puree the soup: Pour the soup into your blender in batches and puree on high for 30 to 60 seconds, until smooth and creamy. Return the soup to the saucepan and warm it over low heat. Stir in the remaining 1\xe2\x81\x844 teaspoon the salt, and add the pepper. Season with additional salt and pepper, to taste.\n6 To serve: Ladle portions of the soup into bowls, and top with the Brussels sprouts chips.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Just be sure to not have too many sweet vegetables like carrots and parsnips, or too many sharp ones, like radishes or turnips.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon sugar\n1/4 cup sherry or red wine vinegar\n1 cup chopped parsley, loosely packed\n2/3 cup extra virgin olive oil\n2 large carrots (choose different colored carrots if you can find them)\n2 medium parsnips\n1 small celery root\n2 black radishes or 1/2 daikon radish\nMETHOD\n1 Make the vinaigrette: Put the mustard, salt, sugar, vinegar and parsley in a blender and process until combined, about 30 seconds. Scrape down the sides of the blender, cover and process at its slowest setting.\nDrizzle in the olive oil slowly. When it is all in, move the blender to its highest setting and puree for about 90 seconds.\n2 Shred the root vegetables: Peel all the vegetables except for the radishes, if you are using black ones. The slivers of black in the salad look cool, so I leave them in.\nUsing a vegetable peeler or a coarse grater, slice shreds off the vegetables into a bowl. Try to keep the shreds roughly the same length if you can.\n3 Toss shredded vegetables with vinaigrette: To finish, toss some of the vinaigrette with the shredded vegetables and let stand in the fridge for at least 20 minutes before serving.\nHello!

Therefore, it is extremely important to find a fishmonger you trust and who will sell you high quality fresh fish.\nServe ceviche with thick-cut tortilla chips, as you would salsa, or eat it on its own as a salad.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 whole ears corn\n4 to 6 limes, juiced (3/4 to 1 cup of juice)\n1/4 red onion, very thinly sliced\n1 pound firm white fish, cut into 1/2-inch pieces (I used halibut)\n2 medium ripe avocados, diced\n1 cup loosely packed cilantro leaves, chopped\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nThick-cut tortilla chips, to serve\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the corn: Fill a large pot with about an inch of water. Place a steamer basket in bottom of pot and layer corn on top. Cover tightly and cook on high for 10 minutes.\nWhen cool enough to handle, shuck the corn.\nIf desired, brush the corn with oil and cook on a hot grill (or under a broiler set to high) for a couple of minutes on each side until the corn starts to caramelize and get crunchy in spots.\nAllow to cool (you can carry on with making the ceviche). When it\xe2\x80\x99s cool enough to handle, slice the corn off the cob. The corn can be prepared up to a day in advance.\n2 Make and marinate the ceviche: In a large bowl, mix together the lime juice, red onion, and salt. Add the fish and stir so the fish is evenly coated with lime juice.\nCover and refrigerate for 15 to 30 minutes, until the fish is firm and opaque. Stir occasionally as you think about it. Start tasting the fish after 15 minutes, and continue until it is as firm as you like it.\nOnce it has reached your preferred firmness, it\'s best to serve the ceviche right away. (Ceviche left for too long will eventually become mushy and unappealing.)\n3 Serve: When ready to serve, mix in the diced avocado, corn kernels, and chopped cilantro. No need to strain, before serving, though if it seems like there\'s a lot of liquid, serve with a slotted spoon.\nServe immediately with thick cut tortilla chips.\nHello!

Add the rice and reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and steam it until it is no longer crunchy, about 15 minutes.\n2 Make the spice blend: In a small bowl, combine the spices. Add the vanilla extract and 1/4 cup of the coconut milk to the spices, and whisk to create a smooth paste. This prevents the spices from clumping together when you add them to the steamed rice.\n3 Combine the rice and coconut milk: Once the rice has finished cooking, add 4 cups of the coconut milk and the spice paste to the pot. Scrape the bottom of the pot to loosen any rice that may be stuck.\n4 Simmer the rice pudding: Bring the mixture to a gentle simmer over low heat, uncovered, and cook without stirring for 15 minutes. The surface of the rice pudding should develop small bubbles; if large, rapidly moving bubbles break the surface of the milk, lower the temperature. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stir it because you don\xe2\x80\x99t want the rice to break up. A skin will form on the surface, but that's fine!\nAfter 15 minutes, add the brown sugar and stir the pudding (also stir any any skin that's formed). When you scrape the bottom of the pot, it will sound like rustling paper. Simmer for another 20 minutes, stirring frequently, or until the pudding has thickened to the consistency of mayonnaise.\n5 Transfer to a shallow dish and chill: Remove the cinnamon stick and star anise from the pudding and discard. Transfer the pudding to a shallow dish (like a pie plate or casserole dish) and refrigerate uncovered until cold, at least 3 hours, up to overnight.\n6 Finish with coconut milk and cinnamon: Just prior to serving, stir in the remaining coconut milk. Spoon the pudding into individual serving dishes and garnish with a sprinkle of ground cinnamon and toasted coconut flakes.\nStore any leftovers in a covered container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days.\nHello!

If you\'d like to swap out the champagne for liquor, use half the amount called for.\nEdible gold leaf isn\xe2\x80\x99t tough to work with and I buy mine from Amazon. I like the loose sheets sold by Barnabas Blattgold the best.\nINGREDIENTS\n20 ounces chopped dark chocolate or quality dark chocolate chips\n8 ounces (1 cup) heavy cream\nPinch of salt\n1/3 cup champagne or sparkling wine (sparkling or flat, either is fine)\n3 to 4 tablespoons cocoa powder, sifted\nEdible gold leaf, optional\nSpecial equipment:\n8-inch loaf pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the pan: Lightly butter an 8-inch loaf pan and line with a sling of parchment paper, leaving a few inches of overhang on two sides. The butter will help the parchment paper stick to the pan without slipping.\n2 Make the chocolate: Combine the chocolate, cream, and a pinch of salt in a heatproof bowl and set it over a pan of simmering water. Make sure the water does not touch the bottom of the bowl. Stir the mixture over the heat until just melted and smooth.\nRemove from the heat and whisk in the champagne.\n3 Chill the chocolate block: Scrape the chocolate into the prepared loaf pan with a spatula and smooth the surface. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or up to 24 hours, until set firmly (there will still be some slight give, which is good).\n4 Slice the truffles: Warm a knife in hot water, dry it off, and then run it around the rim of the pan to loosen the chocolate block. Lift out the block using the parchment sling.\nTrim the ends of the truffle to square them off if you want. (And save the trimmings for yourself!) Cut the block in half through the middle to make two squares. Cut each square into thirds and then cut into fourth to make cubes. As needed to prevent sticking, wipe down your knife, dip it again in warm water, and wipe dry.\n5 Coat the truffles with cocoa. Place the sifted cocoa powder in a bowl. Carefully toss each cube cocoa powder. If you want to apply gold leaf, make sure to leave one of the sides clear so the leaf has something to stick to.\n6 Apply the gold leaf (optional): Avoid touching the gold leaf with your fingers at it will stick to whatever it touches. Use a very dry, very clean paint brush to apply it to the truffles. Lightly brush or dab the surface of the gold leaf with your paint brush to "grab" some of the gold leaf, and then dab it on the surface of the truffle. The leaf should adhere to the truffle and slip off of the brush.\nRepeat until all the truffles have a little gold leaf on top.\n7 Serving and storing: If serving the same day, arrange the truffles on a plate and store in the fridge until serving. Take them out of the fridge a little bit before serving to take the chill off. Truffles can also be stored in an airtight container for up to 3 days.\n  Hello!

Cover and bring to a boil, then reduce heat to its lowest setting.\n2 Reduce champagne with shallots, whisk in butter: In separate medium sized pot, add the sparkling wine and shallots. Bring to a rolling boil, and boil until the wine has reduced to 3/4 of a cup.\nTurn off the heat and wait until the wine stops simmering, then whisk in 1/4 cup of butter, a little at a time.\n3 Make roux with butter and flour: Heat 3 Tbsp butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat. When the butter stops foaming, add the flour and stir well to combine. Stirring often, cook this roux for 5 minutes, or until it turns the color of coffee-with-cream.\n4 Slowly add hot stock to roux: Working with two hands, slowly add the hot stock (along with the mushrooms) to the roux. It will sputter and spit at first, but keep pouring in the stock and stirring. It will turn into a silky sauce.\n5 Whisk in butter shallot champagne mixture, pour through sieve: To finish, turn the heat off and whisk in the butter-shallot-sparkling wine mixture.\nPour the mixture through a fine mesh sieve into a bowl, to strain out the mushroom and shallots. Add salt to taste and keep warm until you need it.\nDo not let it boil or the sauce may separate.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nTurkey Mushroom Risotto Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Serves 4\nYou must use risotto rice for this recipe or it will not work. These rices\xe2\x80\x94Arborio, Carnaroli or Vialone Nano\xe2\x80\x94contain special starches that slough off when you stir the rice, creating a creamy sauce without any added cream. You can use chicken stock instead of turkey stock, but note that the turkey stock is what gives this risotto its turkey flavor.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 Tbsp butter\n1 large shallot, chopped\n1/3 pound chanterelles or other fresh mushrooms, chopped\n2 garlic cloves, chopped\n1 Tbsp fresh sage, chopped\n1 1/2 cups Arborio, Carnaroli, Vialone Nano, or other risotto rice\nSalt\n3 cups turkey stock\n2 ounces Chevre or other fresh goat cheese\nBlack pepper to taste\nMETHOD\n1 Simmer turkey stock and water: Bring the turkey stock, plus an additional 2 cups of water, to a simmer.\n2 Cook shallots and mushrooms: Heat the butter in a medium-sized pot over medium-high heat for 1-2 minutes, until it begins to brown. Add the shallots and mushrooms and toss to combine. Salt them well and saut\xc3\xa9 until the shallots are translucent, about 3 minutes.\n3 Add the garlic, sage and rice and stir well. Saut\xc3\xa9 for another 1-2 minutes, stirring often.\n4 Start adding stock: Add 1 cup of the simmering stock. Stirring constantly, let the stock evaporate before adding another 1/2 cup. Repeat, stirring almost constantly, until the rice is al dente, cooked through but still a little firm. This will take about 20-30 minutes.\n5 When the rice is al dente, add the goat cheese and stir well to combine. Add the black pepper and stir again. Serve at once.\nHello!

Not a big fan of this approach. Better to save the ribs for another recipe, use them for making vegetable stock, or compost them.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 Tbsp unsalted butter\n6 ounces of shiitake mushrooms, sliced 1/4-inch thick\n1/4 teaspoon Kosher salt\n2 large bunches of Swiss chard (about 1 1/2 pounds total), rinsed, patted dry, large ribs removed, leaves roughly chopped\nSprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Saut\xc3\xa9 mushrooms in butter: In a large stick-free saut\xc3\xa9 pan melt the butter on medium-high heat. Stir in the sliced mushrooms. Sprinkle with salt (skip added salt if using salted butter).\n2 Add chopped chard: Once the mushrooms are beginning to brown and have given off some water, add the chopped chard leaves to the pan and toss with the mushrooms. (You may have to stagger in the adding of the chard leaves, as not to overwhelm the pan.)\nOnce the chard leaves have wilted, remove from heat and cover the pan. Let the chard leaves steam in their residual heat for a couple minutes.\n3 Sprinkle with Parmesan: Place chard and mushrooms in a serving dish.

Lay the bacon strips on the wire rack perpendicular to the wires, making sure the bacon pieces don\xe2\x80\x99t overlap.\n2 Bake the bacon and scrub the potatoes: Place the bacon in a cold oven and set the temperature to 375\xc2\xb0F. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Check the bacon around the 18-minute mark. Some types of bacon cook faster than others. (See How to Make Bacon in the Oven for full details.)\nWhile the bacon bakes, scrub potatoes well and then stab each potato about 10 times with a fork to prevent the possibility of a potato exploding in the oven. (It can happen!)\nRemove the bacon from the oven; transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\n3 Bake the potatoes: Increase the heat to 400\xcb\x9aF. Place potatoes on a baking sheet, drizzle well with olive oil, and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake potatoes for about an hour until the skins are shriveled slightly and the potatoes are very tender. (See How to Bake a Potato for more details.)\n4 Blanch the broccoli: While the potatoes bake, cook your broccoli. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a big pinch of salt to the water to season it. Add broccoli to the water and boil for 3 minutes until the broccoli is just tender, but not mushy at all.\nDrain broccoli once it is tender and set aside for assembly. We will warm everything up once the potatoes are assembled at the end.\n5 Open the potatoes: Once your potatoes are baked, let them cool slightly so you can handle them. Cut each potato down the center, being careful not to cut all the way through. Then cut two perpendicular cuts near the end of each potato; this will allow you to open each potato up easier. I like to use a small paring knife to slice up the interior of the potato, making it easier to unfold and stuff.\n5 Stuff the potatoes: Sprinkle some cheese over the potato. I like a lot of cheese, but feel free to use as much or as little as you\xe2\x80\x99d like. Top with about 1/2 cup of cooked broccoli and 1 piece of crumbled bacon. Sprinkle the broccoli with more cheese and more broccoli or bacon depending on the size of the potato and the size of your appetite!\n6 Reheat the potatoes: Place the stuffed potato back in the oven for 5-10 minutes to really melt the cheese and warm the fillings.\n7 Serve: Top the warm potatoes with sour cream and chives and serve.\nLeftovers: Store any extra potatoes before filling them. Leftover potatoes can be used within a week for baked potatoes, loaded potatoes, or quick Dad Add home fries!\n8 How to Make Dad Add Home Fries: Cut a leftover potato into about 1/4-inch cubes. Into a medium skillet set over medium heat, add the olive oil. When the oil starts to shimmer, add the potato cubes and seasoned salt. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are crispy and browned on the edges. Remove from skillet and serve with eggs.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Put in a large bowl, and stir in the sugar and salt. Stir in the melted butter.\nPreheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C), with rack in lower third of oven.\n2 Press the graham cracker crumbs into the bottom of the springform pan: Gently press down on the crumbs using your fingers, until the crumbs are a nice even layer at the bottom of the pan, with maybe just a slight rise along the inside edges of the pan.\n3 Bake the crust: Place the pan on a baking sheet and bake at 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) for 10 minutes. Remove from the oven and let cool. While the crust is cooling, you can skip ahead and start on the filling. Wait until the crust has cooled to wrap the pan in foil in the next step.\n4 Triple wrap pan in heavy duty foil: Prepare the springform pan so that no water leaks into it while cooking. Place a large 18-inch by 18-inch square of heavy duty aluminum foil on a flat surface.\nPlace the springform pan in the middle of the foil. Gently fold up the sides of the foil around the pan. Make sure to do this gently so that you don't create any holes in the foil.\nIf there are any holes, water will get into the pan and ruin the crust.\nPress the foil around the edges of the pan. Place a second large square of foil underneath the pan, and repeat, gently folding up the sides of the foil around the pan and pressing the foil against the pan.\nTo be triply safe, repeat with a third layer of heavy duty foil. Gently crimp the top of the foil sheets around the top edge of the pan.\nMAKE THE CHEESECAKE\n1 Beat cream cheese, then sugar: Cut the cream cheese into chunks and place in the bowl of an electric mixer, with the paddle attachment. Mix on medium speed for 4 minutes until smooth, soft and creamy. Add the sugar, beat for 4 minutes more.\n2 Add salt, vanilla, then eggs, then sour cream: Add the salt and vanilla, beating after each addition. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating for one minute after each addition. Add the sour cream, beat until incorporated.\n3 Add the heavy cream, beat until incorporated. Remember to scrape down the sides of the mixer bowl, and scrape up any thicker bits of cream cheese that have stuck to the bottom of the mixer that paddle attachment has failed to incorporate.\n4 Prepare pan and boiling water: Place the foil-wrapped springform pan in a large, high-sided roasting pan. Prepare 2 quarts of boiling water.\nHeat the oven to 325\xc2\xb0F (160\xc2\xb0C).\n5 Pour filling into pan: Pour the cream cheese filling into the springform pan, over the graham cracker bottom layer. Smooth the top with a rubber spatula.\n6 Place in oven: Place the roasting pan with the springform pan in it, in the oven, on the lower rack.\n7 Carefully pour the hot water into the roasting pan (without touching the hot oven), to create a water bath for the cheesecake, pouring until the water reaches halfway up the side of the springform pan, about 1 1/4 inches. (Alternatively you can add the water before putting the pan in the oven, whichever is easier for you.)\n8 Bake at 325\xc2\xb0F (160\xc2\xb0C) for 1 1/2 hours.\n9 Turn off the heat of the oven. Crack open the oven door 1-inch, and let the cake cool in the oven, as the oven cools, for another hour. This gentle cooling will help prevent the cheesecake surface from cracking.\n10 Chill 4 hours: Cover the top of the cheesecake with foil, so that it doesn't actually touch the cheesecake. Chill in the refrigerator for a minimum of 4 hours, or overnight.\nFINISH AND SERVE THE CHEESECAKE\n1 Prepare the sour cream topping: Place sour cream in a medium sized bowl, stir in the powdered sugar and vanilla, until smooth. Chill until you are ready to serve the cake.\nNote that this recipe produces enough sour cream topping for a thick topping and some extra to spoon over individual pieces of cheesecake, if desired. If you would like a thinner layer of topping and no extra, reduce the sour cream topping ingredients in half.\n2 Prepare the raspberry sauce: Place raspberries, sugar, and water in a small saucepan. Use a potato masher to mash the raspberries. Heat on medium, whisking, about 5 minutes, until the sauce begins to thicken. Remove from heat. Let cool.\n3 Prepare the cheesecake to serve: Remove the cake from the refrigerator. Remove the foil from the sides of the pan, and place the cake on your cake serving dish. Run the side of a blunt knife between the edge of the cake and the pan.\nDorie recommends, and we've done with success, that you use a hair dryer to heat the sides of the pan to make it easier to remove. Open the springform latch and gently open the pan and lift up the sides.\nSpread the top with the sour cream mixture. Serve plain or drizzle individual slices with raspberry sauce.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nLemon Cheesecake Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 1 hourChill Time time: 8 hoursYield: 12-16 servings\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the gingersnap crust:\n7 ounces (198g) crisp gingersnap cookies (or graham crackers)\n4 tablespoons (57g) unsalted butter, melted\n3 tablespoons sugar\nPinch of kosher salt\nFor the cheesecake batter:\n2 pounds cream cheese, softened\n1 cup (200g) sugar\n1 packed tablespoon lemon zest (from 1-2 fresh lemons)\n4 large eggs\n1 cup (227g) sour cream\nPinch of kosher salt\nTo serve:\nPrepared lemon curd, store-bought or homemade\nSpecial equipment:\n10-inch springform pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the oven and baking sheet: Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. On a baking sheet place a sheet of aluminum foil large enough to wrap around the outside of the springform pan. Set it aside.\n2 Make the crust: To make the crust, place the cookies into the bowl of a food processor and process until you get fine, even crumbs. Mix the cookie crumbs with the melted butter, sugar, and kosher salt until you get the consistency of wet sand, and the mixture clumps together when squeezed in the palm of your hand.\nPress the crust mixture into the bottom of a 10-inch springform pan in an even layer. You can either keep the crust layer only on the bottom, or on the bottom and pressed up against the sides. It is totally up to you!\nBake for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and set on a cooling rack while you prepare the cheesecake filling.\n3 Reduce the heat and create a steam bath: Turn the oven down to 325\xc2\xb0F. Place a 9x13-inch baking dish on the lower rack of the oven and fill with boiling water; this will create a steamy environment for the cheesecake to bake.\n4 Make the batter: In the bowl of a stand mixer (or using a mixing bowl and hand mixer) beat the cream cheese until smooth and creamy, scraping the sides of the bowl a few times so there are no lumps of firm cream cheese. Beat in the sugar, lemon zest, and salt, then scrape down the sides.\nBeat in the eggs one at a time, mixing until each egg is combined and scraping down the sides and bottom of the bowl after each addition. Resist the urge to whip the mixture too much; just beat in each egg until mixed well\xe2\x80\x94over-beating can pull too much air into the batter, resulting in a cracked cheesecake.\n5 Add the sour cream and spread the filling over the crust: On low speed, beat in the sour cream until just combined. Spread the cheesecake filling into the pre-baked crust.\n6 Bake the cheesecake: Put the cheesecake onto the foil-lined baking sheet. Press the foil up and around the outside of the springform pan.\nPlace the baking sheet with the cheesecake on it, on the center rack of the oven, above the pan of hot water, for 1 hour or until the cheesecake appears set and dry on top but still jiggles in the center like Jello.\n7 Allow the cheesecake to cool slowly: Turn off the oven and allow the cheesecake to cool for 60 minutes with the oven door closed.\nCrack open the oven door (place a wooden spoon between the door and the frame of the oven to keep it just cracked) and allow the cheesecake to cool for an additional 45 minutes before removing from the oven to cool on a baking rack, until it reaches room temperature.\nThe cheesecake may have domed slightly while baking but should deflate to a flat top with a small ridge around the edge, as it slowly cools.\nRemove the foil once the cheesecake has cooled to room temperature (anytime after the cheesecake has pulled away from the edges of the pan and it's cool enough to handle).\n8 Transfer to the refrigerator: Once the cheesecake is at room temperature, transfer it to the refrigerator to chill for at least 6 hours before serving.\n9 Top with lemon curd and serve: To create the petal pattern as shown in the photos, pipe or dollop small blobs of curd in a ring around the perimeter of the cheesecake, leaving about 1/2-inch border.\nUsing an offset spatula or the back of a teaspoon, gently smash and drag the blobs toward the center of the cheesecake. If you have leftover lemon curd, serve the rest when you slice the cheesecake.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nNo-Bake Cheesecake Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesChilling time: 1 hourYield: 8 to 12 servings\nBe sure to let the cream cheese warm at room temperature until very soft before making the cheesecake, at least 2 hours. If you forget, you can speed up the process by placing the wrapped packages of cream cheese in a bowl of warm water.\nI use an actual vanilla bean in this cheesecake because I think it adds a rounder and more complex flavor than extract, plus I like the way the specks look in the finished cheesecake.\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a vanilla bean, feel free to add an additional 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract to the cheesecake (a total of 4 teaspoons).\nThe gelatin in this recipe helps firm up the cheesecake and make it easy to slice without the need for commercial whipped cream (which already has stabilizers) or sweetened condensed milk (which can make the cheesecake too sweet).\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crust:\n8 ounces (225 g) store-bought graham crackers (about 14 rectangular crackers)\n6 tablespoons (85 g or 3/4 stick) unsalted butter, melted\nFor the cheesecake filling:\n1 tablespoon (1 1/2 packages) powdered gelatin\n1/4 cup cold water\n16 ounces (455 g or 2 bricks) cream cheese, at room temperature\n1 1/2 cup (175 g) powdered sugar\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n1 vanilla bean\n2 cups cold heavy cream\nFor the strawberry sauce (optional):\n1 pound (455 g) fresh or frozen hulled and sliced strawberries\n2/3 cups (135 g) granulated white sugar\n2 teaspoons cornstarch\n2 teaspoons cold water\n1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\n9-inch springform pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the crust: Lightly coat a 9-inch round springform pan with cooking spray. Break the graham crackers into a few large pieces and place them in a food processor. Process into crumbs. Drizzle in the melted butter and process until the crumbs start to clump together. Dump the buttery crumbs into the prepared pan and press into a thick crust over the bottom of the pan using the bottom of a glass.\n2 Dissolve the gelatin: Sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water in a microwave-safe bowl or glass measuring cup. Stir to moisten - it should look like applesauce. Set aside for 5 minutes to soften. Once softened, microwave the gelatin for 20 to 30 seconds, until the gelatin is dissolved and liquid. Set aside to cool.\n3 Prepare the cheesecake base: Place the cream cheese in the bowl of a stand mixer and sift the powdered sugar over top. Mix on low speed with the paddle attachment until the sugar is begins to mix into the cream cheese, and then raise the mixer speed to medium and mix until the sugar is fully incorporated and the cream cheese looks fluffy and creamy, like frosting.\nScrape down the sides of the bowl and add the vanilla extract. Split the vanilla bean lengthwise and scrape out the seeds with the edge of a butter knife. Add the seeds to the cheesecake batter, and reserve the vanilla pod for another use. Mix for an additional 15 seconds or until the vanilla extract and seeds have been blended in. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and the beater.\n4 Switch to a whisk attachment and add the cream. Mix on low speed until the cream is incorporated, then raise the speed to medium. Stop the mixer and scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Continue to mix, slowly increasing the speed to high, until soft peaks form (peaks that slowly bend over at the tips).\n5 Reduce the speed to medium and slowly drizzle the warm gelatin into the bowl. If your gelatin has cooled too much and started to gel, warm it in the microwave for another 5 to 10 seconds until liquidy again before adding mixing it into the filling. Once all the gelatin has been added, return the mixer speed to high and beat until the mixture forms firm peaks (peaks that stay firmly upright at the tips).\n6 Spoon the filling into the pan on top of the graham cracker crust. Smooth the top of the cheesecake. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour or overnight to firm up.\n7 Prepare the strawberry sauce (optional): Place the strawberries and sugar in a large pot. In a small bowl, stir the cornstarch and cold water together until they make a smooth, milky liquid, and then pour over the strawberries. Cook on medium high heat, stirring constantly for about 5 to 7 minutes or until the strawberries have softened and the sauce has thickened.\nRemove from heat and stir in the balsamic vinegar if using. Let cool to room temperature, then spoon over the chilled cheesecake and return to the refrigerator to chill for an additional hour or overnight. (Alternatively, serve the sauce at the table and spoon over individual slices.)\n8 When ready to serve: Run an offset spatula or a thin butterknife around the edge of the cake, then remove the outer ring. Leave it on the pan base, and transfer to a serving platter or cake stand. Top with any toppings you like. Slice and serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nPressure Cooker Cheesecake Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 40 minutesChilling time: at least 12 hours or up to 24 hoursYield: 8 slices\nReprinted with permission from The Essential Instant Pot Cookbook by Coco Morante copyright \xc2\xa9 2017. Published by Ten Speed Press, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crust:\n8 graham cracker sheets\n1 tablespoon brown sugar\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\nFor the filling:\n2 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature\n1/4 cup heavy cream\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n2 large eggs, at room temperature\n1 large egg yolk, at room temperature\n1/2 cup sour cream\n1 tablespoon powdered sugar\nSpecial equipment:\n7-inch round springform pan\nFood processor\nTrivet\n6-quart Instant Pot, or other electric pressure cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the pan: Line the base of a 7-inch round springform pan with an 8-inch round of parch\xc2\xadment paper. Secure the collar on the springform pan, closing it onto the base so the parchment round is clamped in. Lightly grease the sides of the pan with butter or nonstick cooking spray. (I traced a circle on parchment using the bottom of the springform pan as the guide. This worked great! \xe2\x80\x93Emma)\n2 Make the crust: To make the crust, in a food processor, process the graham crackers into fine crumbs. You should have 3/4 cup. (I recommend measuring out the crumbs as I had slightly more than 3/4 cup. \xe2\x80\x93Emma) Add the brown sugar and melted butter and, using one-second pulses, process the mixture until a uniform, sandy texture forms.\nTransfer the crumb mixture to the prepared pan and press firmly in an even layer onto the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the pan. Place the pan in the freezer to allow the crust to firm up a bit while you make the filling.\n3 Make the filling: To make the filling, in the now-empty food processor, combine the softened cream cheese, heavy cream, granulated sugar, flour, and vanilla. (I wiped the food processor clean before doing this step. \xe2\x80\x93Emma)\nProcess the mixture in about 5 one-second pulses, just until it becomes a smooth filling, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl if necessary.\nAdd the eggs and the egg yolk one at a time, processing for 2 one-second pulses after each addition. Do not overprocess the filling, or you will end up with an overly fluffy cheesecake. Using a spoon or a rubber spatula, gently stir in any remaining streaks of egg yolk. It is fine if a few streaks of egg yolk remain.\nPour the filling into the prepared crust. Tap the pan firmly against the counter\xc2\xadtop a few times to remove any air bubbles in the filling.\n4 Make a sling for the cheesecake: Fold a 20-inch-long sheet of aluminum foil in half lengthwise twice to create a 3-inch-wide strip. Center it underneath the pan to act as a sling for lifting the pan in and out of the Instant Pot.\n5 Assemble everything in the pressure cooker: Pour 1 1/2 cups water into the pot and place the trivet in the pot.\nHolding the ends of the foil sling, lift the cake pan and lower it into the pot. Fold over the ends of the sling so they fit inside the pot.\n6 Pressure cook the cheesecake: Secure the lid and set the Pressure Release to Sealing. Select the Manual setting and set the cooking time for 32 minutes at high pressure. (My Instant Pot took about 8 minutes to come up to pressure before the cooking time actually began. \xe2\x80\x93Emma)\n7 Make the sour cream topping: While the cheesecake is cooking, in a small bowl, whisk together the sour cream and confectioners\xe2\x80\x99 sugar.\n8 Release the pressure naturally and remove the cheesecake from the pot: When the timer goes off, leave the pot on its default Keep Warm setting for 20 minutes, letting the pressure release naturally.\nOpen the pot, taking care not to drip condensation from the lid onto the cheesecake. Wearing heat-resistant mitts, grasp the ends of the foil sling, lift the springform pan out of the Instant Pot, and transfer the cheesecake to a cooling rack.\nUse a paper towel to dab up any moisture that may have settled on the top. (Be sure to dab up any water that pools on the sides too! \xe2\x80\x93 Emma) The cake will be puffed up and jiggle a bit in the center when it comes out of the pot, but it will settle and set up as it cools.\n9 Add the sour cream topping: When the cheesecake has deflated about 1/2 inch, spread the sour cream mixture on top in a smooth, even layer. Let the cheesecake cool on the rack for 1 hour.\n10 Cover and refrigerate for at least 12 hours or for up to 24 hours before unmolding.\n11 Unmold and serve the cheesecake: To serve, unclasp the collar on the pan and lift it off, then use the parchment border to tug the cheesecake off the base of the pan onto a plate, where it can be sliced and served.\n(I ran a thin spatula between the cheesecake and the mold to make sure it released cleanly. You can also clean up any rough edges with the spatula before serving. Also, my leftover cheesecake kept just fine in the fridge for about a week! So good! \xe2\x80\x93Emma)\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nPumpkin Cheesecake Recipe\nYield: Makes 16 servings\nYou can make your own pumpkin pur\xc3\xa9e by cutting a sugar pumpkin in half, scooping out the seeds, placing the pumpkin halves cut-side down in a roasting pan with a 1/4 inch of water in it, and cooking it in a 350\xc2\xb0F oven for an hour, until soft. Scoop out the flesh and pur\xc3\xa9e it in a blender or food processor. Strain out excess water.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crust:\n1 cup pecans\n1/2 cup all-purpose flour\n1/2 cup brown sugar\n1/2 cup graham cracker crumbs (approximately 4 graham crackers)\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, softened\n1 egg yolk\nFor the filling:\n2 15-ounce cans pumpkin puree (see Recipe Note)\n3 tablespoons all purpose flour\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/4 teaspoon freshly grated nutmeg\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n2 tablespoons vanilla extract\n2 tablespoons bourbon or other whiskey\n5 large eggs\n4 8-ounce packages cream cheese, room temperature\n2 cups (1 pound) brown sugar\nSpecial equipment:\n1 9-inch diameter, 3-inch tall springform pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make graham cracker pecan crust: Pulse pecans, flour, brown sugar, and graham cracker crumbs in a food processor. Add butter and egg yolk. Pulse until mixture is homogenous. Press into bottom of 9\xe2\x80\x9d springform pan and bake for 10 minutes at 375\xc2\xb0F. Remove from oven and let cool.\n2 Drain or strain any liquid from pumpkin pur\xc3\xa9e. Take pumpkin pur\xc3\xa9e and place on several layers of paper towels. Cover with several layers of paper towels and use your hands to gently squeeze out liquid from the pur\xc3\xa9e.\nNote that you will probably go through a lot of paper towels (can use tea towels too). Two 15-ounce cans of pur\xc3\xa9ed pumpkin should yield a little more than 2 cups of pur\xc3\xa9e, with the excess moisture removed. You want exactly 2 cups of the pur\xc3\xa9e.\n3 Mix spices with pumpkin pur\xc3\xa9e, bourbon, eggs: Whisk together the flour, cinnamon, ground ginger, grated nutmeg, and allspice in a medium bowl. With a wooden spoon (no need for a mixer for this step), mix in the salt, pumpkin pur\xc3\xa9e, vanilla, and bourbon. Beat in the eggs, one at a time.\n4 Mix cream cheese with brown sugar, add pumpkin mixture: In a large bowl, (helps to use a mixer for this step) combine the cream cheese and the brown sugar until fully creamed and smooth (no lumps). Gradually add the pumpkin mixture until fully incorporated. Bring a kettle of water to a boil.\n5 Line pan with 3 layers of thick foil: Place crust-baked springform pan in the middle of three layers of large sheets of heavy duty aluminum foil (to help prevent water-bath moisture from leaking into the pan). Fold the aluminum foil up the sides of the pan and trim. (You can also use a turkey roasting bag instead of the foil to keep the water out.)\n6 Pour filling into pan: Place the aluminum wrapped pan in a large roasting pan (large enough so that there is room on all sides). Pour the pumpkin cream cheese mixture into the springform pan.\n7 Pour hot water into roasting pan to create water bath: Place the roasting pan containing the springform pan in a 325\xc2\xb0F oven on the middle rack. Pour boiling water into the pan so that it comes halfway up the side of the springform pan.\n8 Cook for 1 1/2 hours. Turn off the oven heat and prop the oven door open. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven, cooling for another hour. Then remove from oven and let come to room temperature. Once it has cooled down, chill for several hours in the refrigerator, preferably overnight.\n9 When ready to serve, gently remove the cake from the springform pan.\nTo do this well, I recommend a tip by Dorie Greenspan in her book Baking: From My Home to Yours. To help ensure that the cake doesn't stick to the springform side as you unlock it, first run a blunt knife around the cake and then warm the sides of the pan with a hair dryer. Then carefully unlock the springform and lift off the sides.\nServe cheesecake with caramel sauce, candied pecans, and whipped cream.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Grease and line an 8x8 baking dish with parchment paper, leaving an overhang of parchment on two sides. This will help you lift the bars out of the pan after they\xe2\x80\x99ve been baked.\n2 Make the crust: Pulse vanilla wafers in a food processor until fine crumbs the size of sand are formed. You should end up with 1 cup of crumbs. Add sugar and salt to the food processor and pulse 5 times to combine. Pour in melted butter and pulse until the mixture starts to clump together, 5-10 seconds. The crust will look like wet sand and stick together when squeezed. Remove blade and use a small rubber spatula to stir in 2 tablespoons mini chocolate chips.\n3 Form the crust to the pan: Dump the cookie crumb mixture into the prepared baking dish. Firmly, press crust into the bottom of the dish in an even layer. You can use the bottom of a measuring cup for this. It should be firm enough to not move when gently touched. Bake for 10 minutes. The crust will be slightly golden brown around the edges.\nRemove from oven to cool on a cooling rack while you make the filling.\nTurn the oven down to 325\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Make the filling: Beat the cream cheese in a mixing bowl (or in the bowl of a stand mixer) until smooth.

b'Save It Print\nRaspberry Cheesecake in a Mason Jar Recipe\nCook time: 2 hoursCooling and chilling time: 1 hourYield: Makes 4 individual servings\nAs soon as you think you want to make these cheesecakes, take the cream cheese out of the refrigerator to help it soften as it warms to room temperature.\nYou can probably easily double the recipe without having to double the raspberry sauce (it\'s a generous amount).\nINGREDIENTS\n1 12-ounce package frozen raspberries\n3/4 cup sugar, divided 1/2 cup and 1/4 cup\n1/3 cup water\n10 Oreo cookies, without the filling, or 20 chocolate wafer cookies\n2 Tbsp melted butter\n8 ounces cream cheese, room temperature\nPinch salt\n1 egg\n1/3 cup sour cream\nWhipped cream for topping\nFresh raspberries for garnish\n  4 Wide-mouthed 8-ounce mason jars\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the raspberry sauce: Set aside 1/2 a cup of the frozen raspberries from the package. With the remaining raspberries, place them in a medium saucepan. Add 1/2 cup sugar and 1/3 cup of water. Bring to a simmer on medium high heat, then lower the heat to maintain the simmer, and gently cook, whisking frequently, until the raspberries have completely broken down, about 10 minutes.\nIf you want, strain the raspberry sauce through a sieve to remove the seeds, and then return the sauce to the pan and continue to gently simmer until the the sauce is syrupy. Set aside to cool.\n2 Make the Oreo cookie crust: Grind the chocolate cookie wafers (Oreo or other brand) in a food processor, mini chopper, or by placing in a plastic bag and crushing with a rolling pin, until finely ground.\nPlace in a medium bowl and stir in the melted butter. Divide evenly among the mason jars, packing the chocolate "crust" at the bottom of each mason jar in a layer about 1/4 to 1/3-inch thick.\nAt this point you can put in a 350\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 minutes to bake the crust in, which will make it easier to pour in the cheesecake filling without it mixing in with the crust. (Or if you don\'t care if the bottom is a little messy, you can skip this part.)\n3 Make the cream cheese filling: In a mixer, beat the cream cheese on medium speed for 4 minutes, until smooth and light. Add 1/4 cup of sugar and beat 4 minutes more. Add a pinch of salt and the egg, and beat another minute.\nAdd the sour cream and beat another minute, until smooth. Add 1/4 cup of the cooled raspberry syrup from step one, and beat until incorporated.\n4 Layer raspberries and filling on top of crusts in mason jars: Place the reserved raspberries on top of the chocolate crusts in the mason jars in a single layer. Pour the raspberry cheesecake filling over the raspberries in the jars.\n5 Bake in water bath: Place in a roasting pan and add about an inch of boiling water to the pan to create a water bath, which will help the cheesecakes cook more evenly. Bake at 325\xc2\xb0F for 40 minutes. Then turn off the heat in the oven and let the cheesecakes continue to gently cook in the residual heat of the oven for another 30 minutes.\n6 Chill and top with whipped cream and raspberry sauce: Remove from oven and let cool to room temp. Chill for at least a half hour before eating. Don\'t worry if there are cracks on the surface of the cheesecakes. Top with the remaining raspberry sauce, whipped cream, and fresh raspberries.\nHello!

Pour 1 1/2 cups of water into the pressure cooker, lower the cheesecake inside the pot, place the lid on in its sealed position, and cook at high pressure for 27 minutes. Let the pressure release naturally completely before opening the pot, then refrigerate and serve as directed.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crust:\n1/4 cup pecans or pecan pieces\n8 graham cracker sheets\n1 tablespoon brown sugar or turbinado sugar\n1 tablespoon unsalted butter, melted and cooled\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\nFor the filling:\n12 ounces cream cheese, at room temperature\n1/4 cup heavy cream\n1/2 cup canned pumpkin puree\n1/2 cup brown sugar or turbinado sugar\n1 tablespoon all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n3/4 teaspoon pumpkin pie spice\n2 large eggs plus 1 egg yolk, at room temperature\nFor the whipped cream:\n1 cup heavy cream\n1 tablespoon bourbon\n1 tablespoon powdered sugar\nTo garnish:\nSprinkling of ground cinnamon\n2 tablespoons chopped toasted pecans\nSpecial equipment:\n7-inch round springform pan, or 7-inch by 3-inch push-pan\nFood processor\n6-quart electric pressure cooker, such as the Instant Pot\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the pan: Line the base of a 7-inch round springform pan or 7-inch by 3-inch push-pan with parchment paper. Lightly grease the sides of the pan with butter or nonstick cooking spray.\n2 Toast the pecans: Toast the pecans in a dry skillet over medium heat on the stovetop for 4 to 5 minutes until they become fragrant; watch carefully to avoid burning. Alternatively, toast the pecans in a 350\xc2\xb0F oven for about 10 minutes, checking frequently, until toasted and fragrant.\nAllow the nuts to cool.\n3 Process and prepare the crust: In a food processor, process the cooled pecans and graham crackers to fine crumbs. Add the brown sugar, melted butter, and salt. Using 1-second pulses, process until the mixture resembles damp sand.\nTransfer the crumb mixture to the prepared pan and press firmly into an even layer on the bottom and about 1/2 inch up the sides of the pan. Use the bottom of a drinking glass to firmly press the crumbs into the bottom.\nPlace the pan in the freezer to allow the crust to firm up a bit while you make the filling.\n4 Make the filling: In the now-empty food processor, combine the cream cheese, heavy cream, pumpkin puree, brown sugar, flour, vanilla, and pumpkin pie spice. Process the mixture for about five 1-second pulses, just until smooth, stopping to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed.\nOne at a time, add the eggs and the egg yolk, processing for two 1-second pulses after each addition until just barely combined. Using a rubber spatula, gently stir in any large streaks of egg yolk. It\xe2\x80\x99s fine if a few small streaks remain. (Do not over-process the filling, or the batter may overflow the pan as it cooks and you will end up with an overly fluffy cheesecake, which may crack as it cools.)\n5 Pour the filling into the prepared crust. Remove the crust from the freezer and pour in the filling. Tap the pan firmly against the countertop a few times to remove any air bubbles from the filling. Place the pan on a long-handled silicone steam rack.\nIf you are using a tall push pan, you can cover it with aluminum foil to keep any condensation off of the cheesecake. If using a springform, do not cover.\n6 Pressure cook the cheesecake: Pour 1 1/2 cups water into the Instant Pot. Holding the handles of the steam rack, lower it into the pot.\nSecure the lid and set the Pressure Release to \xe2\x80\x9cSealing.\xe2\x80\x9d Select the Cake, Pressure Cook, or Manual setting and set the cooking time for 32 minutes at high pressure. (The pot will take about 10 minutes to come up to pressure before the cooking program begins.)\n7 Release the pressure and cool: When the cooking program ends, leave the pot on its default \xe2\x80\x9cKeep Warm\xe2\x80\x9d setting for 20 minutes, letting the pressure release naturally.\nAfter 20 minutes, open the pot, taking care not to drip condensation from the lid onto the cheesecake. Wearing heat-resistant mitts, grab the handles of the steam rack, lift it out of the pot, and transfer the cheesecake to a cooling rack.\nIf you have not covered the pan with foil, use a paper towel to dab up any moisture that may have settled on the top. If the pan is covered, remove the foil, taking care not to get burned from the steam.\nThe cake will be puffed up and jiggle a bit in the center when it comes out of the pot, but it will settle and set up as it cools.\n8 Cool and refrigerate the cheesecake: Let the cheesecake cool on the rack for about 1 hour, then cover (or re-cover) and refrigerate for at least 12 hours, or up to 24 hours.\n9 Prepare the whipped cream: The day you plan to serve the cheesecake, make the whipped cream. In a medium bowl or stand mixer, combine the heavy cream, bourbon, and powdered sugar. Using an electric mixer or whisk, beat the mixture vigorously (about 2 minutes on high) until fluffy and just stiff enough to hold its shape. Cover the bowl and refrigerate for up 12 hours.\n10 Serve the cheesecake: If using a springform pan, run a knife around the side of the pan, then unclasp the collar on the pan and lift it off to unmold it. Use the parchment border to tug the cheesecake off the base of the pan and onto a plate.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re using a push pan, run a knife around the side of the pan, place a drinking glass under the pan, then gently slide the outside ring of the pan downwards.\nTransfer the cheesecake to a serving plate. Cut into wedges and serve each piece topped with whipped cream, chopped nuts, and a sprinkle of cinnamon.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nBanoffee Cheesecake Recipe\nPrep time: 40 minutesCook time: 1 hourCooling and Chilling time: 16 hoursYield: 12 servings\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the toffee sauce:\n3/4 cup heavy cream\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter, sliced\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 cup (197 g) packed light brown sugar\n3 tablespoons dark corn syrup\n1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract\nFor the banoffee cheesecake:\n2 (5-ounce) packages Walker\xe2\x80\x99s shortbread cookies\n1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar, divided\n3 tablespoons melted unsalted butter\n4 (8-ounce) packages cream cheese, at room temperature\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n4 large eggs\n3 ripe bananas, peeled and mashed\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 teaspoon banana extract\n1/3 cup cornstarch\nTo garnish:\nToffee sauce\nWhipped cream\nDried banana chips\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the toffee sauce: Warm the heavy cream in the microwave for one minute, or on the stovetop over medium heat. The cream should steam, but not boil. Set this aside.\nIn a 4-quart saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the salt, brown sugar, and corn syrup. Whisking frequently, heat until the sugar has dissolved and the syrup bubbles gently. This should take anywhere from 3 to 5 minutes.\nTurn the stove off and whisk in the warmed cream\xe2\x80\x94be careful, as the sugar will bubble and steam once the cream is poured in. Add the vanilla extract to the sauce and set the pan back over medium heat.\nCook for another 5 minutes, or until the syrup is thick. Transfer the sauce to a glass jar and store in the refrigerator until ready to use, up to one week in advance.\n2 Prep the oven and the pan: Preheat your oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Wrap a 10-inch springform pan in heavy duty aluminum foil and set aside; be very careful not to tear or puncture the foil.\n3 Make the shortbread crust: Use a food processor to pulse the shortbread cookies into fine crumbs. Add 1/4 cup of granulated sugar and the melted butter to the food processor bowl and pulse until the crumbs hold together.\nSqueeze a handful of crumbs in the palm of your hand. If the mixture doesn\xe2\x80\x99t hold together, add another tablespoon of melted butter, and re-mix.\n4 Pre-bake the crust: Press the shortbread mixture onto the bottom and an inch or so up the sides of the springform pan. Bake the crust for 10 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and allow it to cool while you prepare the cheesecake filling.\n5 Heat water: While the crust bakes, heat 4 or 5 cups of water to boiling for the water bath.\n6 Prepare the banana cheesecake: In the bowl of a stand mixer with a paddle attachment (or in a large mixing bowl), blend together the cream cheese, the remaining 3/4 cup sugar, and the salt until smooth.\nAdd the eggs, one at a time, to the cream cheese mixture, stopping to scrape down the sides after each addition. Mix on low speed for an additional minute.\nAdd the banana puree and both extracts. Blend on low for another minute. Scrape down the mixing bowl and add the cornstarch. Blend on the lowest speed for 30 seconds, or until no lumps of cornstarch are visible, being careful not to over-mix. \n7 Bake the cheesecake: Pour the batter into the prepared pan and set the foil-wrapped springform pan into a larger pan. Add enough hot water to reach halfway up the sides of the springform pan and carefully place the pan into the oven.\nBake the cheesecake for 55 minutes to an 1 hour, or until the top is a light golden brown and the cheesecake jiggles slightly when shaken. Turn the oven off and open the door a crack to allow the cheesecake to cool in the oven for 30 minutes.\n8 Cool the cheesecake completely: Once the cheesecake has cooled in the oven, carefully take it out of the oven and remove the foil. Cool the cheesecake on the countertop for an hour, then transfer it to the refrigerator to cool completely, at least 12 hours or up to 24 hours.\n9 Decorate the cheesecake: Once the cheesecake is cold, remove the collar from the springform pan. Warm the toffee sauce slightly so that it's pourable but not runny (I set it in a dish of warm water), then drizzle one cup of the toffee sauce over the top of the cheesecake. Use a piping bag to pipe rosettes of whipped cream around the cheesecake and garnish each rosette with a banana chip.\nKeep the cheesecake refrigerated until ready to serve, and be sure to keep leftovers chilled, too.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nTriple Chocolate Cheesecake Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hourCook time: 1 hourChill Time time: 12 hoursYield: Serves 12\nLet the eggs and cream cheese come to room temperature before making this cheesecake. You will also need make this cake 24 hours before you want to serve it to allow adequate time to chill, and frankly, we all need a bit more chill time.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crust:\n8 chocolate graham crackers, crushed (about 1 1/4 cups)\n1/3 cup (66 g) sugar\n1 tablespoon cocoa powder\nPinch of kosher salt\n4 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted\nFor the filling:\n8 ounces semi-sweet chocolate, chopped\n1/3 cup heavy whipping cream\n4 large eggs, room temperature\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n1/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, room temperature\n1 1/4 cup (250 g) sugar\n2 tablespoons cocoa powder\nFor the ganache topping:\n3/4 cup heavy whipping cream\n1 tablespoon corn syrup (optional)\nPinch of kosher salt\n8 oz semi-sweet chocolate, finely chopped\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\nSpecial equipment:\n9-inch springform pan\nHeavy-duty, extra-long aluminum foil\nRoasting pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Make the crust: In the bowl of a food processor fitted with the metal s-blade attachment, add the graham crackers. Pulse until they are ground fine like sand.\nAdd the sugar, cocoa powder, and salt. Pulse 2 or 3 times until just combined. Pour melted butter around the bowl in a circle, pulse 4 or 5 times combine it. The mixture should clump a little bit, but may still look a little dry.\nDump the mixture into the bottom of your ungreased springform pan. Use your fingers or the underside of a cup to press the mixture into the bottom of the pan, making it as even as possible.\nPlace the crust in the oven and bake for about 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven to cool.\n3 Reduce the oven temp and melt the chocolate: Once the crust has baked, reduce the oven to 300\xc2\xb0F.\nIn a medium-sized, heavy-bottom saucepan set over low heat, combine the chopped chocolate and 1/3 cup heavy cream. Stir continuously, for about 10 minutes. Once melted, remove from heat, and set aside. You will fold it into your filling later.\n4 Make the cheesecake filling: In a small bowl or Pyrex measuring cup, gently beat the eggs, vanilla extract, and salt together with a fork. Set it aside.\nUsing a stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment (or a hand mixer set to low and a large bowl), add the cream cheese. Beat the cream cheese on low or stir speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl.\nBeat again on low for about 1 minute. With the stand mixer still on low, slowly add the sugar and two tablespoons cocoa powder. Stop the mixer. Scrape down the bottom and sides of the bowl. Beat for another minute or two until light and fluffy.\nWith the mixture still on low, add the egg mixture, 1/3 at a time, scraping down the sides of the bowl after each addition.\nPour the cooled, melted chocolate into the bowl of the stand mixer and (you guessed it!) beat on low for about a minute. Scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl. Beat on low again for about 30 seconds, or until the chocolate is fully incorporated. Alternatively, you can fold in the chocolate in using a spatula.\n5 Prepare the water bath and add the filling: Wrap the outside of the your springform pan in 3 layers of aluminum foil. Be careful not to tear or puncture the foil. Bring the foil all the way up the sides. Set it inside a roasting pan or a large Dutch oven.\nPour the filling into springform pan.\nFill the roasting pan with warm water about halfway up the sides of the springform pan. (I usually just heat it in a tea kettle.) Be careful not to splash any water into the cheesecake pan or inside the foil.\n6 Bake the cheesecake: Put the pan in the oven and bake until the cheesecake is just barely set in the center, 55-65 minutes. It will still jiggle slightly, but shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t slosh in the center when moved.\n7 Let it cool, then chill: Remove the roasting pan from the oven. Let the cake cool in the water bath for about an hour. Then remove it from the water bath and transfer it to a cooling rack on the counter for another hour. Finally, keep the cake in the springform pan, and let it chill, uncovered overnight in the fridge.\n8 Make the ganache: Place chopped chocolate in a medium-sized bowl. In a small saucepan set over medium heat, add the heavy cream, corn syrup, and salt. Stir to combine and bring to a simmer.\nPour the heated cream over the chopped chocolate. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stir. Let sit for 5 minutes, then add the vanilla. Use a spatula and stir gently to combine. Let the ganache cool at room temperature for 2 hours. Cover with plastic wrap and keep it in the fridge until you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to serve the cheesecake.\n9 Finish the cake: The ganache is probably too thick to pour. Simply warm it in the microwave for 15-second intervals (or more depending on how powerful your microwave is) until it\xe2\x80\x99s pourable. (Be careful, though \xe2\x80\x93 chocolate can burn quickly in a microwave.) Stir it gently.\nRemove the cheesecake from the springform pan. Pour about half of the ganache over the top, just until it drips down a little on the sides. You probably won\xe2\x80\x99t use all of the ganache. Save the rest to add to hot milk for the most luxurious hot cocoa or freeze it in scoopfuls for when you need a little chocolate fix.\n10 Serve the cake: Serve the cake with sliced strawberries (if you wish), slice, and enjoy!\nHello!

b"Print\nSweet Cherry Pie Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hourPie chilling before baking time: 30 minutesYield: Makes 8 servings\nWe've used 1/2 cup of sugar for the filling, which results in a pie not overly sweet. You may want to use more or less sugar, depending on how sweet you would like your pie to be, and how sweet your cherries are.\nINGREDIENTS\nPie dough for top and bottom 9 or 10-inch pie (see pie crust recipe)\n5 cups sweet cherries, pitted\n1/2 cup sugar\n1/2 teaspoon almond extract\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n6 tablespoons cornstarch\n2 teaspoons of butter, cut into small pieces\n1 large egg\nCoarse sugar for sprinkling\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the cherry filling: Place the pitted cherries, sugar, almond extract, lemon juice and cornstarch in a large bowl. Toss until the cherries are well coated with the sugar and other ingredients.\n2 Roll out bottom crust: On a lightly floured clean surface, roll out the bottom crust. Form it into a 9- or 10-inch pie pan. Using kitchen scissors, trim the edges so that they extend beyond the edge of the pie pan by 1 inch. Place in the refrigerator while you roll out the top crust.\n3 Roll out top crust: Roll out the top crust to about the same size as the bottom crust. If you want to make a lattice top (it's pretty and it's easy to do) follow these instructions for making a lattice pie crust.\n4 Fill the pie: Use a slotted spoon to lift the cherries out of the bowl and put them in the pie plate. (Leave any excess liquid behind.) Dot with small dabs of butter. Cover with the top crust. Trim the edges. Crimp to seal the edges together.\n5 Score the pie and chill: Score the top crust with several cuts so that the steam can escape while the pie is cooking (unnecessary if you are making a lattice crust). Chill the pie for 30 minutes before cooking.\n6 Preheat the oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. \n7 Brush with egg wash (optional): In a small bowl, whisk the egg with a tablespoon of water or milk. Use a pastry brush to brush over the top crust. Sprinkle the top with coarse sugar.\n8 Bake: Place the pie on the middle rack, with a baking sheet on the rack below to catch any pie drippings.\nBake for 15 minutes, then reduce the temp to 350\xc2\xb0F and cook for 45 to 55 minutes longer, or until the crust is nicely browned and the filling is thick and bubbly.\n9 Allow to cool completely before serving.

b"Save It Print\nCherry Hand Pies Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesChill time: 15 minutesYield: 6 hand pies\nBe sure to thaw the puff pastry before using, ideally in the fridge overnight. Puff pastry can also be quickly thawed on the counter top, but keep an eye on it on hot days so that it doesn't become too soft to work with.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound fresh or frozen sweet cherries -- pitted but left whole if fresh, thawed if frozen\n1/3 to 1/2 cup sugar\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\nZest and juice of one lemon\n1 large egg + 1 tablespoon water\n1 17-oz. package puff pastry, thawed\nCoarse decorating sugar (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 450\xc2\xb0F. Line a baking sheet with parchment and set aside.\n2 Make the cherry filling: In a colander placed over a bowl, combine the cherries, 1/3 cup of sugar, cornstarch, lemon zest, and juice. Stir to combine and then let it sit for 15 minutes. This resting time allows some of the juice to drain out of the fruit and will ensure your filling isn\xe2\x80\x99t too liquidy. Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry. There will still be plenty of cherry juice left!\nTaste after 15 minutes and add additional sugar if needed.\n  3 Unroll and cut the puff pastry: When you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to make the hand pies, unroll one portion of puff pastry and press it out gently to make it even thickness. Cut into 6 even rectangles and place the rectangles on the baking sheet lined with parchment paper.\nCut the second sheet of puff pastry into matching pieces.\n4 Fill the hand pies: Spoon about two tablespoons of cherry filling onto each rectangle on the baking sheet and then top with the rectangles from the second sheet of puff pastry. Using a fork, crimp the edges of the hand pies to seal them. You should get six cherry hand pies out of the recipe.\nCut 2 or 3 slashes on the top of each hand pie with a serrated knife. Whisk together the egg and tablespoon of water and brush over each hand pie. Sprinkle with coarse sugar, if using.\n   5 Briefly freeze the pies: Prior to baking, freeze the hand pies for 15 to 30 minutes to chill the filling so it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t explode while baking.\nPies can also be completely frozen, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap, and stored for up to 3 months before baking.\n6 Bake the pies: Remove the pies from the freezer and put them straight into the oven. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes, rotating the pan once half way through until the hand pies are beautifully browned and puffy.\nIf you are baking completely frozen hand pies, you can move them straight into the oven from the freezer. Add 5 to 6 minutes onto baking time.\n7 Cool and serve, or store. Let the hand pies cool before serving. Once cooled, store leftover hand pies an airtight container in the fridge. They will keep for a few days.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"
b"Save It Print\nCherry Ice Cream with Chocolate Chips Recipe\nYield: Makes about one quart\nYou can also try making this ice cream with yogurt instead of cream. Heat the cherries, sugar, salt, and milk first. Then let cool. Add 1 3/4 cup of full-fat yogurt and pur\xc3\xa9e. Everything else is the same except no need to add lemon juice.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 1/2 cups pitted ripe sweet cherries (from about 3/4 lb cherries)\n3/4 cup milk\n1 3/4 cups cream\n1/2 cup sugar\n1 pinch salt\n1 teaspoon lemon juice\n2 Tbsp Amaretto, cherry liqueur, or rum (optional)\n4 ounces bittersweet chocolate, chopped fine, keep in freezer until used\nMETHOD\n1 Heat cherries, milk, 1 cup cream, sugar, salt, then pur\xc3\xa9e: Put cherries, milk, one cup of the cream, sugar, and salt into a medium saucepan. Heat on medium heat until the mixture is steamy, then lower the heat to warm and just let sit for about 15 minutes.\nRemove from heat. Pour mixture into a blender, or use an immersion blender, and carefully pur\xc3\xa9e.\n(Careful because you are dealing with a hot liquid. Make sure you hold the cap down on the top of the blender while pur\xc3\xa9eing.)\n2 Stir in remaining cream and chill: Put mixture into a large bowl. Stir in the remaining 3/4 cup of cream.\nChill for several hours in the refrigerator until completely cold. (Can also place bowl over an ice bath, to speed up the cooling process.)\n3 Stir in lemon juice and Amaretto: Before putting the mixture into your ice cream maker, stir in the lemon juice and the Amaretto or other liqueur if you are using. Note that you can skip the alcohol if you want, but the addition of it will help the ice cream from getting too icy, and the amaretto can add a nice flavor boost to the ice cream.\n4 Churn with your ice cream maker: Churn the ice cream in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's instructions.\n5 Fold in chocolate chips and freeze: Once the ice cream has completed churning, the ice cream should be pretty soft. Gently fold in the finely chopped chocolate.\nPut in an airtight container and place in the freezer for at least an hour, preferably several hours.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nSweet Cherry Cobbler Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: 12 servings\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the filling:\n2 1/2 pounds pitted fresh or frozen sweet cherries\n1/2 cup (70 grams) granulated sugar\n1 tablespoon lemon juice\n1 tablespoon cornstarch (use 1 1/2 tablespoons if using frozen cherries)\n1/8 teaspoon kosher salt\nFor the topping:\n2 cups (250 grams)  all-purpose flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/4 cup (35 grams) granulated sugar, plus additional for sprinkling over top\n1 tablespoon lemon zest\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n6 tablespoons (85 grams) unsalted butter cut into small pieces\n1 cup whole milk\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\nSpecial equipment:\n9x13 baking pan\nIce cream scoop, optional\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 375\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Make the filling: In a large mixing bowl, combine the whole pitted cherries, sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch, and salt, and stir to coat. Spread the cherries into a 9x13 inch baking dish and set aside.\nIf you are using frozen cherries, you can put the dish in the preheating oven to defrost them a bit while you make the cobbler topping.\n3 Make the topping: In a medium mixing bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, sugar, lemon zest, and salt and whisk with a fork. Using your hands or a pastry blender, work the butter into the dry mixture until it becomes coarse, sandy, and well incorporated.\nWhisk the milk and vanilla together in a measuring cup, and using a fork, work the liquid into the dry mixture until you get a thick batter--it should resemble something between biscuit dough and pancake batter.\n   4 Top the cobbler: Using a levered ice cream scoop or a large spoon, drop large scoops of the batter on top of the cherries. Make about 9 mounds of batter over the top of the cherries; they won\xe2\x80\x99t completely cover the cherries but that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. As it bakes, the dough will puff and spread out. Sprinkle about 2 tablespoons of sugar over the top of the batter.\n5 Bake the cobbler: Bake the cobbler in the preheated oven for about 40 minutes, or until the topping is golden brown and the cherry juices are bubbling throughout. (If you are using frozen fruit, expect to bake an additional 15 minutes).\n6 Serve: Serve the cobbler warm with vanilla ice cream. This cobbler is best the day it is made, but leftover servings can be reheated in the microwave for about 1 minute. Store any leftover cobbler in the pan covered with plastic or in an airtight container in the refrigerator.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

If you want the salsa less juicy, put the finished salsa into a fine-meshed strainer and strain off some of the excess juice.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/2 cup chopped red onion\n2 tablespoons lemon juice\n1 1/2 pounds cherries, about 4 cups\n4 pork chops, about 3/4-inch thick\nSalt\nExtra virgin olive oil\n2 Tbsp chopped fresh basil\n1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 heaping teaspoon sugar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Mix onion with lemon juice: Mix the chopped onion with the lemon juice in a small bowl and set aside. The lemon juice will help take the edge off the onions.\n2 Coat the pork chops in olive oil and sprinkle salt over them. Set aside at room temperature.\n3 Pit and de-stem the cherries. A cherry pitter is magical for this task, but if you don't have one, use a small knife. Double check for stray pits, they always seem to find their way into dishes that call for fresh cherries.\n4 Process cherries, onions, basil for salsa: Put the cherries, onions and chopped basil into a food processor. Pulse a few times until you have a chunky salsa, with differing textures of cherry. Alternately, you can chop everything by hand.\n5 Add balsamic vinegar, salt, sugar to salsa: Mix in the balsamic vinegar, the 1/2 teaspoon salt and sugar. Add more of any of these ingredients to taste. Set aside at room temperature. You can make this salsa up to 8 hours in advance.\n6 Grill pork chops: Prepare your grill for high direct heat. Grill the pork chops over high heat with the grill cover closed for 3 minutes. Turn them 45 degrees on the same side to get a pretty cross-hatch pattern, then close the grill cover and cook another 3 minutes.\nTurn the pork chops over, but this time keep the grill cover open and cook for a final 2-3 minutes. Allow to rest for 5-10 minutes before serving.\nServe the pork chops with the cherry salsa.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nTomato Galette With Parmesan Whole Wheat Crust Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesCook time: 30 minutesChilling time: 50 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nNote: While this pie crust comes together easily in the food processor, using cornmeal and whole wheat flour can be a bit challenging if you're a beginner. If you've never made a pie crust before, you might want to start with a pie crust like this recipe instead to get a feel for the process. (A recipe for a single pie crust can be substituted for this one.)\nUse only the best, freshest, ripest cherry tomatoes for this recipe. It won't be nearly as good with out-of-season grocery store tomatoes. A mix of colors makes the tart especially pretty.\nDon't forget to salt the tomatoes before making the galette so they release some of their juices. Not only does this help keep the crust from getting soggy, but it also adds a lot of flavor to the tomatoes themselves.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the whole wheat crust:\n1 cup (135g) whole wheat flour\n1 cup (120g) all-purpose flour\n1/3 cup (50g) coarse cornmeal\n1/4 cup (20g) shredded Parmesan\n3/4 teaspoon salt\n8 ounces (2 sticks) cold unsalted butter, cut into cubes\n1/2 cup ice water, more as needed\nFor the tomato filling:\n4 cups (about 1 3/4 pounds) cherry tomatoes, halved\nSalt (for the tomatoes)\n1/2 cup (40g) shredded Parmesan\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme leaves\n1 large egg, well beaten with 1 tablespoon water\n1 tablespoon chopped parsley, to garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Chill the crust ingredients: In a bowl, combine the whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, cornmeal, Parmesan and salt. Add the butter pieces and toss with your hands to separate and coat them with flour. Place the bowl in the freezer for 30 minutes.\n2 Make the dough: Pour the flour and butter mixture into the bowl of a food processor. Process in 4 to 5 long pulses, or until the butter is cut into small pieces (a few larger pieces are okay.)\nOpen the top of the machine and drizzle the ice water over the flour and butter. Close and pulse in a series of short bursts, until the mixture looks like wet sandy gravel.\nPress a small amount of the dough together in your hand. It should form a clump that holds together firmly and without cracking at the edges. If it feels crumbly or dry, put it back in the food processor, sprinkle the mixture with an additional tablespoon or two of the ice water, and pulse briefly to mix.\nTo mix by hand: Follow step one, and use a pastry cutter or wire whisk to break up the butter into small pieces. Drizzle the ice water over the mixture and toss it together with your hands as if you were tossing a salad. If it still feels dry, add water, one tablespoon at a time. When the dough starts to come together, shape it as directed in the next step.\n3 Shape and chill the dough: Empty the dough onto the countertop. Quickly press the dough together to form a disk about an inch or so thick. Resist the temptation to knead or squish the dough. The idea is to firmly compress all the little bits of dough together into a disk shape without overworking the dough.\nWrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.\n4 Salt the tomatoes: Line a baking sheet with paper towels. Spread the tomatoes on the baking sheet and sprinkle evenly with about a teaspoon of salt. (This might seem like too much at first, but the saltiness mellows out perfectly once the tomatoes have rested for a little while.)\nLet stand while the dough chills (about 30 minutes). The tomatoes will start to release their juices as they sit. Before assembling the galette, blot the tomatoes dry with paper towels until much of the liquid is absorbed.\n5 Preheat the oven to 425\xc2\xbaF. Line a baking sheet with parchment.\n6 Roll and fill the galette: On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough into a 15-inch circle. Transfer to the baking sheet (it will drape over the sides, but that\xe2\x80\x99s okay).\nSprinkle the Parmesan for the filling in a rough 11-inch circle over the bottom of the dough, leaving the edges clear. Arrange two-thirds of the tomatoes, cut-side up, over the cheese (reserve the remaining third). Sprinkle with the thyme.\nFold the edges over the tomatoes, pleating as necessary. Brush the edges of the crust with beaten egg.\n7 Bake the galette: Bake for 30 minutes, or until the crust is golden. Scatter the reserved tomatoes over the top of the galette and sprinkle with parsley. Serve warm or at room temperature.\nThis galette is best served the day it is made. Leftovers will keep for several days, refrigerated.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"

Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes, or until just starting to soften but not yet falling apart. Transfer to a separate dish and set aside.\nAdd the the scallions to the pan and cook for about 1 minute, or until softened. Stir in the spinach and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the spinach wilts. Remove the pan from the heat and cool for a few minutes.\nStir in the crumbled feta cheese.\n3 Whisk egg mixture: In a large bowl, gradually whisk the milk into the sour cream until smooth. Whisk in the eggs, 1/2 teaspoon of salt and pepper.\n5 Assemble and bake the frittata: Transfer the spinach filling from the pan into the baking dish and pour the egg mixture over top. Scatter the tomatoes on top of the eggs so they peek out, and sprinkle with the parsley.\nBake for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the eggs are set. You can check with a paring knife inserted in the middle; the eggs should be set and no longer be runny.\n6 Serve: Cool the frittata for at least 10 minutes, and cut into 9 servings.

You can use it for dipping crusty toasted bread. Or, you can remove the chicken, tomatoes, and garlic to a serving dish and pour the strained liquid into a small saucepan and boil until reduced to a thicker sauce. You can pour this sauce back over the chicken or pour it over rice or pasta.\nThe recipe calls for bone-in thighs. If you make it with boneless thighs you may need to reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.\nThe recipe calls for skin-on thighs. If you make it with skinless thighs, try to cover the thighs as much as you can with the tomatoes, to help prevent the meat from drying out. If you make it with skinless breasts, do the same, and reduce the cooking time to 25 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds (900 g) bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs, trimmed of excess fat\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n2 cups of cherry tomatoes (a heaping basket or 25 to 30 cherry tomatoes)\n6 whole cloves garlic, peeled\n1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar\n1 1/2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil\n2 sprigs fresh rosemary (or 1/2 teaspoon dry rosemary)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Arrange chicken thighs in casserole dish, sprinkle with salt: Place chicken thighs in a baking dish that allows for a little room between the thighs. Sprinkle both sides of the chicken thighs with salt.\n2 Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xb0F (190\xc2\xb0C).\n3 Prep cherry tomatoes with garlic, vinegar, oil: Cut the cherry tomatoes in half. Place in a bowl with the whole garlic cloves. Sprinkle with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.\n4 Place tomatoes, garlic, rosemary around chicken: Pour the cherry tomatoes over the chicken pieces and arrange so that they are squeezed around the chicken pieces. You want the chicken skins to be exposed so they brown in the oven. Lay sprigs of rosemary over the tomatoes.\n(If you are using dry rosemary instead of fresh sprigs, just mix it in with the tomatoes.)\n5 Bake: Bake, uncovered for 45 minutes, until the chicken is well browned on the top and cooked through. Remove from oven and cool for 5 minutes. Skim the excess chicken fat with a ladle.\nServe with toasted crusty bread, buttered noodles, or rice.

b"Save It Print\nCherry Tomato Orzo Salad Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 8-10 as a side\nINGREDIENTS\n8 ounces orzo pasta\nSalt\n1 pint red cherry tomatoes, sliced in half\n1 pint yellow cherry tomatoes, sliced in half\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n8 ounces feta cheese, crumbled\n1 large cucumber, peeled and chopped\n2 green onions, thinly sliced\n2 Tbsp minced fresh oregano\nJuice of a lemon\nBlack pepper to taste\nMETHOD\n1 Cook orzo pasta in salted water: Bring a large pot of well salted water to a rolling boil. Add the orzo, stirring it so that it doesn't stick to the bottom of the pan. Cook, uncovered, at a high boil until al dente, cooked through but still a bit firm.\nDrain the pasta (it helps to use a fine mesh sieve for this as the small orzo might pass through holes in a colander), and rinse with cold water to stop the pasta from cooking further.\n2 Toss pasta with olive oil, tomatoes, feta, cucumber, green onions, oregano, lemon juice, pepper: Toss the pasta with the olive oil in a large bowl. At this point you can make ahead and chill until you are ready to serve (or transport to a party).\nToss with the rest of the ingredients, the tomatoes, feta cheese, cucumber, green onions, oregano, lemon juice, and black pepper. The feta is salty so you shouldn't need to add more salt.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

An extra step, but worth it if you have the time!\nTo brine the shrimp, mix together 4 cups water, 1/4 cup kosher salt (or 3 Tbsp table or sea salt), 1/4 cup white sugar until the salt and sugar have dissolved. Add one cup of ice and the shrimp.

Add the chopped shallots and cook until translucent, a couple of minutes.\nAdd the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, a half minute more.\n3 Lightly brown the rice: Add the risotto rice to the pan and toss to coat with the shallots. Increase the heat to medium high and let the rice start to brown.\n4 Add the white wine: Stir in the white wine. The pan will steam up. Let the rice absorb the wine.\n5 Start adding the stock, 1/2 cup at a time: Here is the real process of making risotto. Add the stock, a half cup or ladleful at a time, slowly stirring the rice, and allowing the rice to absorb the stock for a minute or two, before adding another ladleful of stock.\nYou\'ll want to stop adding the stock when the rice is cooked through, but still a little firm to the bite, "al dente". Note that you may not need all of the stock you have heated for this recipe.\n6 Add balsamic, tomatoes, thyme with last 1/2 cup of stock: When it comes time for that last 1/2 cup of stock to add to the risotto, add it, as well as the balsamic vinegar. Balsamic vinegar can vary in its acidity and intensity. So, add 1 tablespoon to start, and add another tablespoon if you want more of the balsamic flavor.\nAdd half of the cherry tomatoes and add the thyme. Let the tomatoes soften with the cooking of the risotto in those last few minutes.\n7 Remove from heat, stir in Parm: When the risotto has reached it\'s "al dente" stage, remove it from heat. Stir in the shredded Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle with pepper.\n8 Serve: Serve with remaining halved fresh cherry tomatoes and thinly sliced basil on top.\n  Hello!

I have). Canned (jarred more like it) chestnuts actually work better in recipes than the kind you roast and peel yourself. The texture and moisture content is more consistent. So, we suggest using canned roasted chestnuts for this recipe. You can of course roast and shell your own if you prefer.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Brussels sprouts\n1/3 pound thick-sliced bacon or slab bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces or batons\n1 red onion, chopped\n20-25 canned roasted chestnuts, quartered or roughly chopped\n1/4 cup chicken stock\nSalt and pepper to taste\nLemon wedges to serve\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the Brussels sprouts: Cut the Brussels sprouts in half and slice thinly, starting at the top of the sprout and working back toward the stem. Discard the hard tip of the stem side.\n2 Cook the bacon: Cut the bacon into pieces about 1/4 inch wide and put them in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium heat.\nWhen the bacon is browned, remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n3 Cook the onions in bacon fat, add back the bacon:  Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat (do not put down the drain, see how to render bacon fat).

However, if those are not available, you can easily prepare chestnuts from scratch if you want. Cut a cross, about 1/8 inch deep and wide enough to go to the edges of one side of the chestnut, into the shells (so steam can escape), place on a baking tray cut side up, and roast for 30-35 minutes at 350\xc2\xb0F. Cool until cool enough to handle, but still warm, and peel off the shells.

Increase the heat to high and bring to a boil, reduce the heat to low, and simmer, covered, for 45 minutes.\n3 Pur\xc3\xa9e the soup: Working in batches, pur\xc3\xa9e in a blender or food processor until completely smooth. Remember to fill the blender bowl no more than halfway, and keep your hand pressing down on the top of the blender lid, or the pressure from blending the hot liquid may cause the soup to splatter everywhere.\n4 Adjust seasoning, add Pernod and/or sour cream: If too thick, add more water to thin to the consistency you desire. Taste and add more salt and pepper if needed. Stir in the Pernod or Pastis if using (or other anise flavored liqueur).\nEither stir in sour cream, or dilute the sour cream and drizzle over the bowls at service.\nServe hot, garnish with fennel fronds.\nHello!

If you barbecue breasts, keep them on the coolest part of the grill (or follow this method).\nThis recipe assumes fairly large chicken pieces (like the main pieces from a 4 to 5 pound whole chicken). If you are working with smaller chicken pieces, they may require a shorter cooking time. If you are cooking wings, they too may be done before the other larger pieces.\nA note about the skin. Even if you do not plan on eating the chicken skin, it\'s still best to barbecue it with it on. The skin will protect the chicken pieces from drying out.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 pounds of your favorite chicken parts (legs, thighs, wings, breasts), skin-on\nSalt\nExtra virgin olive oil or vegetable oil\n1 cup barbecue sauce, store-bought or homemade\nMETHOD\n1 Oil and salt chicken pieces: Coat the chicken pieces with olive oil and sprinkle salt over them on all sides.\n2 Prepare grill: Prepare one side of your grill for high, direct heat. If you are using charcoal or wood, make sure there is a cool side to the grill where there are few to no coals.\n3 Sear chicken on hot side of grill, move to cool side: Lay the chicken pieces skin side down on the hottest side of the grill in order to sear the skin side well. Grill uncovered for 5-10 minutes, depending on how hot the grill is (you do not want the chicken to burn).\nOnce you have a good sear on one side, turn the chicken pieces over and move them to the cooler side of the grill.\nIf you are using a gas grill, maintain the flame on only one side of the grill, and move the chicken pieces to the cooler side, not directly over the flame. Reduce the temp to low or medium low (between 250\xc2\xb0F and 275\xc2\xb0F, no more than 300\xc2\xb0F).\nCover the grill and cook undisturbed for 20-30 minutes.\n4 Turn over and baste with barbecue sauce: Turn the chicken pieces over and baste them with with your favorite barbecue sauce. Cover the grill again and allow to cook for another 15-20 minutes.\nRepeat, turning the chicken pieces over, basting them with sauce, covering, and cooking for another 10-30 minutes.\nNOTE that timing will depend on your grill set-up, the size of your chicken pieces, and how cold your chicken pieces are to start with! If you are grilling smaller pieces of chicken on a charcoal grill, they may be done much earlier. The goal is to maintain a low enough grill temp so that the chicken cooks "low and slow".\n5 Finish with a sear or remove from heat when done: The chicken is done when the internal temperature of the chicken pieces are 160\xc2\xb0F for breasts and 170\xc2\xb0F for thighs, when tested with a meat thermometer.\nOr if you insert the tip of a knife into the middle of the thickest piece and the juices should run clear, the chicken is done.\nIf the chicken isn\'t done, turn the pieces over and continue to cook at a low temperature.\nIf you want, you can finish with a sear on the hot side of the grill. To do this, put the pieces, skin side down, on the hot side of the grill. Allow them to sear and blacken slightly for a minute or two.\n6 Paint with more barbecue sauce to serve.\nHello!

Serrano Mayo:\n2-3 grilled serrano peppers, seeds removed\n1 cup mayonnaise\nJuice from 1/2 lime\nPinch of salt\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the slaw: Whisk together mayo, pickle juice, and sugar. Stir in shredded cabbage, carrots, and pickles. Stir together and taste. Season to your liking. Slaw can be made a day or two in advance with no problem.\n\n2 Heat the grill and prepare the chicken: Preheat grill to medium-high heat. To butterfly the chicken, use a sharp knife to slice the chicken horizontally \xe2\x80\x93 leaving the edge connected so you can open the chicken breast \xe2\x80\x93 making it thinner and therefore faster-cooking. Then drizzle with olive oil, salt, and pepper.\nPour 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce into a bowl and set it aside. You will add it to the cooked chicken later.\n3 Grill the chicken and chiles (if using): Add chicken to grill and spoon BBQ sauce over each piece of chicken. You will use 1/3 to 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce for this part of cooking.\nGrill for 5 to 6 minutes on the first side. Flip and add BBQ sauce to the second side. Grill for another 5 to 6 minutes on the second side or until the chicken breasts reach 165\xcb\x9aF. Remove from the grill.\nAs the chicken grills, add 2 to 3 serrano peppers to the grill. Grill them for 2 to 3 minutes per side. Remove and let cool.\nNOTE: If you do not butterfly your chicken breasts, you will need to grill them for 8 to 10 minutes longer than this.\n4 Shred the chicken: When chicken comes off the grill, let it cool briefly and then use two forks to shred or roughly chop the chicken. Stir the 1/2 cup of BBQ sauce you set aside in step 1 into the shredded chicken.\n5 Making the serrano mayo: Split grilled peppers in half and remove seeds. Add to a small food processor with mayo, lime juice, and salt. Pulse until combined.\n6 Make your sandwich: Toast your sandwich buns (if you want to) and smear with serrano mayo if you\xe2\x80\x99re using it. Top with a heap of pickle slaw and shredded BBQ chicken. Serve with chips and pickles on the side.\nLeftover chicken will keep in the fridge for 3 to 4 days or freeze in an airtight container for up to three months.\nHello!

b'Print\nInstant Pot Paella with Chicken and Sausage Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nIf using a stovetop pressure cooker, cooking time is the same.\nShort-grain rice is traditional for paella, however it\'s fine to substitute long-grain white rice or quick-cooking brown rice for this recipe. Cooking times are the same.\nNote from the editor: Our original version of this recipe called for one ripe diced tomato or one whole canned tomato (crushed), which adds a more authentic flavor to the paella. However, we received comments that this caused the paella to occasionally burn on the bottom. We\'ve removed the tomatoes from the recipe to ensure a more consistently successful dish, but if you\'d like to experiment with tomatoes on your own, add the tomato after cooking the garlic and cook until most of the liquid has evaporate before adding the onions. Thanks!\nINGREDIENTS\n1 1/2 cups low sodium chicken broth\nBig pinch of saffron threads (roughly equal to 1/4 teaspoon)\n1 cup frozen peas\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n3 cloves garlic, chopped\n1 medium yellow onion, chopped\n1 red bell pepper, chopped\n1 pound (3 to 4) boneless skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1 inch pieces\n6 ounces (about 2 links) chorizo or other spicy sausage, sliced\n1 teaspoon smoked paprika\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 1/2 cups (325 grams) short or medium grain rice\n2 tablespoons chopped parsley\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart Instant Pot or other electric pressure cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the saffron with the chicken broth and defrost the peas: In a small saucepan, heat the broth to a simmer, then and add the peas and saffron. Reduce the heat to low to keep the broth warm and give the saffron a chance to infuse the broth while you get everything else ready.\n(You can also heat the broth in a microwave safe bowl or liquid measuring cup for about three minutes. Add the peas and saffron after microwaving and cover to keep warm until needed.)\n2 Cook the vegetables, chicken, and sausage in the pressure cooker: Select the \xe2\x80\x9cSaut\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d setting on your electric pressure cooker and add the oil and garlic. Saut\xc3\xa9 until little bubbles of oil form around the garlic and it becomes aromatic, 1 to 2 minutes.\nStir in the onion and bell pepper. Saut\xc3\xa9 until they have softened a little bit, 3 to 4 more minutes. Stir in the paprika and salt, and saut\xc3\xa9 for one more minute.\nAdd the chicken and sausage and stir to combine. Saut\xc3\xa9 for 5 to 6 minutes, until the chicken has turned opaque. It\'s ok if the chicken is still a little pink in the middle.\n3 Scrape the bottom of the pan: Add a splash of the hot broth to the pan and use it to scrape up any browned bits that have developed on the bottom of the pan. These browned bits add a lot of flavor to the dish, so don\'t skip this step. (This also helps prevent the dish from burning on the bottom during cooking!)\n4 Add the remaining ingredients and the broth: Stir in the rice, then pour in the rest of the hot broth with the peas and saffron. Push down any grains of rice from the sides of the pot, making sure that everything is submerged in the cooking liquid.\n5 Pressure cook the paella: Secure the lid on the pressure cooker, and make sure the pressure regulator is in its \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d position. Cancel the \xe2\x80\x9cSaut\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d cooking program, then select the \xe2\x80\x9cManual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPressure Cook\xe2\x80\x9d program and set the cooking time to 5 minutes at high pressure.\nThe pot will take 5 to 10 minutes to come up to pressure, and then the cooking program will begin counting down.\n6 Release the pressure: When the cooking program ends, let the pressure release naturally for 10 minutes, then release the remaining pressure by moving the pressure regulator to its \xe2\x80\x9cVenting\xe2\x80\x9d position.\n7 Serve: When the pressure has fully released, open the pot. Scoop onto plates, garnish with chopped parsley, and serve it piping hot. Leftovers will keep for about a week.\nYou may get a crust of dark caramelization and crunchy rice at the bottom of the pan -- this is ok! This is called "socarrat" and is traditional for paella. Just mix it in and enjoy!\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint'
b'Save It Print\nClassic Chicken Salad Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesPoaching chicken time: 20 minutesYield: Serves 4\nWe are poaching boneless skinless chicken breasts in salted water for this salad. You could also use any leftover cooked chicken meat, with or without the skin.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the salad:\n1 pound boneless, skinless (raw) chicken breasts, cut into 2 1/2-inch chunks (or 2 to 3 cups cooked chicken meat)\n2 stalks celery, chopped\n1/2 red bell pepper, seeded and chopped\n4 to 6 green olives, pitted and minced\n1/4 cup chopped red onion\n1/2 to 1 whole apple, cored and chopped\n1/3 head iceberg head lettuce, sliced and chopped\nFor the dressing:\n5 tablespoons mayonnaise\n1 tablespoon plum preserves, or any sweet berry preserve (or a lesser amount of honey)\n2 teaspoons fresh squeezed lemon juice\nSalt and pepper to taste\nMETHOD\n1 Poach the chicken (skip if using already cooked chicken): Bring a pot with 2 quarts of well salted water (1 tablespoon salt) to a boil. Add the chicken breast (cut into large chunks) and return the water to a simmer. Then turn off the heat, and cover the pot. Let the chicken sit for 15 minutes (time it) or more while you prepare everything else.\n2 Make the dressing: Prepare the chicken salad dressing in a large bowl. Mix together the mayonnaise, preserves, and lemon juice. Taste for the proper balance of sweetness and acidity. The salad dressing should not be too sweet, nor too sour.\nAdd more preserves or lemon juice until you have reached the balance you want. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n3 Mix in the chopped celery, bell pepper, olives, red onion, and apple.\n4 Dice the chicken, mix with dressing and vegetables: Remove the chicken from the poaching water and dice it. (Or dice already cooked chicken if that is what you are using for this salad.) Mix it in with the dressing and vegetables.\n5 Add lettuce: At this point you can make ahead. When ready to serve, fold in the sliced and chopped iceberg lettuce.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Print\nHow to Make Chicken Stock\nYield: About 2 to 3 quarts of stock\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nMETHOD 1: LEFTOVER CHICKEN BONES\nLeftover bones and skin from a large cooked or raw chicken carcass (or two rotisserie chickens)\nCelery tops and 1 large celery rib, cut into 2-inch segments\nOnion, 1 large onion, quartered (no need to peel)\nCarrot, cut into 2-inch segments\nParsley, 1 bunch\nSalt\nPepper\n1 Put the leftover bones and skin from a chicken carcass into a large stock pot. Add vegetables like celery, onion, carrots, parsley.\nCover with water. Add salt and pepper, about a teaspoon of salt, 1/4 tsp of pepper.\n2 Bring to a boil and immediately reduce heat to bring the stock to barely a simmer. Simmer partially covered at least 4 hours, occasionally skimming off any foam that comes to the surface.\n3 Remove the bones and vegetables with a slotted spoon or spider ladle, and strain the stock through a fine mesh sieve.\n4 If making stock for future use in soup you may want to reduce the stock by simmering an hour or two longer to make it more concentrated and easier to store.\nMETHOD 2: CHICKEN STOCK WITH RAW CHICKEN BACKS, WINGS, AND/OR LEGS\n1 Tbsp olive oil\n4 to 5 lbs of chicken backs, wings, and/or legs, skin-on, trimmed of excess fat, that have been hacked with a cleaver into 2-inch pieces (you can ask your butcher to prepare the chicken pieces this way)\n1 large yellow onion, quartered (no need to peel)\n1 large carrot, cut into 2-inch segments\nCelery tops and 1 large celery rib, cut into 2-inch segments\n1 bunch of parsley\nLeek or green onion greens (if you have them)\n1 bay leaf\n6 quarts of cold water\n1 Tbsp salt\n1 Coat the bottom of a large stock pot (12 quart), with olive oil. Place half of the chicken pieces, skin side down in the bottom of the pot. Heat on medium high, and let cook until the the chicken is browned. Add the rest of the chicken pieces and stir the pot, cooking and occasionally stirring until the chicken is no longer pink.\n2 Add the onion, carrot, celery, parsley, leek greens (if using), and bay leaf to the pot. Cover with 6 quarts of cold water.\n3 Bring to a boil on high heat and reduce to a low simmer. If scum rises to the surface of the pot (this usually happens in the first half hour of cooking), skim off with a large metal spoon. Let simmer at a low simmer, uncovered, for 4 to 6 hours.\n4 Use a large metal spoons with holes in it (or a "spider ladle") to ladle out the cooked chicken and vegetables. (These aren\'t really good to eat, by the way, because after 4 hours of cooking, most of the flavor and nutrients have been cooked out of them and are now in the stock.) Discard.\n5 Use a large sieve lined with dampened cheesecloth or a dampened paper towel (or if using a very fine mesh sieve no need to line), and place over a large bowl or another large pot. Pour the stock through the sieve into the bowl or pot to strain out any remaining solids.\n6 Either pour into jars at this point, or if you want, what we like to do is to boil the stock on high heat for 1 hour, to reduce it by about half. This way you are storing concentrated stock, which takes less room in the freezer or refrigerator. When you are ready, pour into jars.\nIf you are freezing, you may want to ladle off some of the excess fat on the surface. (The fat helps preserve the stock in the fridge, but doesn\'t help it in the freezer.) If freezing, leave at least 1-inch head space, allowing enough room for the liquid stock to expand as it freezes solid. (Otherwise, the expanding ice stock will break the jar.)\nLet the stock cool completely before refrigerating or freezing. Stock should last a week or so in the fridge, and several months in the freezer.\nMETHOD 3: QUICK CHICKEN STOCK\n4 lbs of chicken backs, wings, and/or legs that have been hacked with a cleaver into 2-inch pieces. You can ask your butcher to prepare the chicken pieces this way.\n1 large yellow onion, chopped\nOlive oil\n2 quarts of boiling water\n2 teaspoons of salt\n2 bay leaves\n1 Heat 1 Tbsp of olive oil in a large stock pot. Add one chopped onion. Saut\xc3\xa9 until softened and slightly colored - 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer to a large bowl.\n\n\n2 Add half of the chicken pieces to the pot. Saut\xc3\xa9 until no longer pink, about 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer cooked chicken to bowl with onions. Saut\xc3\xa9 the rest of the chicken the same way. Return onion and chicken pieces to the pot. Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until chicken releases its juices, about 20 minutes.\n3 While the chicken pieces are cooking, fill a large tea kettle with 2 quarts of water, bring to a boil.\n4 After the chicken pieces have been cooking for 20 minutes, raise the heat level to high, add the 2 quarts of boiling water, 2 teaspoons of salt, 2 bay leaves. Return to a low simmer, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon, then cover and barely simmer for about 20 minutes.\n5 Strain stock through cheesecloth or paper towel-lined large sieve, and discard solids. (It helps to remove the big pieces of bone with a slotted spoon first.)\nPour into jars and cool completely before refrigerating or freezing. Stock will last a week or so in the refrigerator or frozen for several months.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

I take chicken off the grill at a little bit lower temp (155\xc2\xb0F) than is usually recommended for poultry, but that's because the chicken will continue to cook for several minutes once it's off the heat and resting. Taking the chicken off the heat at this temperature helps insure that the meat doesn't overcook and get dried out. If you feel more comfortable taking the chicken off the heat at a higher internal temperature, please feel free to do so.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the brine:\n4 cups water\n1/4 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt (or 3 tablespoons sea salt or Morton's kosher salt)\nFor the chicken:\n1 1/2 to 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts\n3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (plus more olive oil for the grill)\n1 1/2 teaspoons paprika\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brine the chicken breast: In a large bowl, whisk the salt in the water to dissolve. Add the chicken breasts to the brine. Put in the refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes.\n2 Prepare your grill: Arrange your grill so that one side is for high direct heat, and the other side is cooler. Alternatively, you can use a grill pan, set over medium-high heat.\n3 Coat chicken with oil and paprika: Remove chicken breasts from brine and pat dry. Coat with olive oil, and sprinkle evenly with paprika.\n4 Grill the chicken breasts: Brush some olive oil on the grill grates. Place chicken breasts on the hot side of the grill (or on the grill pan). Let the chicken grill, undisturbed, until the pieces start getting some grill marks (you can lift up one to check).\nWhen the chicken pieces have browned on one side, turn them over, and move them to the cooler side of the grill. Cover, and let them finish cooking.\nRemove chicken from grill when the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 155\xc2\xb0F.\n5 Let the chicken breasts rest: Cover the breasts with foil. The chicken will continue to cook in its residual heat while it rests. Let it rest 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving.\nServe with grilled peppers, pineapple salsa, or just a squeeze of lime!\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

In a small bowl, toss quartered mushrooms and red peppers with the sesame oil and sriracha. Spread out on a baking sheet.\nWhile you make the Chicken Lo Mein, bake for 15 minutes until tender and blistered in spots.\n2 Stir the sauce ingredients together and set near the stove.\n3 Cook the lo mein noodles: Bring a large amount of salted water to a boil. Add the noodles and cook until tender, usually around 4 minutes, but check the package directions for the noodles you are using.\nDrain the noodles and toss with sesame oil to prevent sticking.\n4 Cook the chicken: Heat a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the vegetable oil once that's hot, add the chicken. Cook until the chicken is just barely cooked through, 5 to 6 minutes, stirring frequently. (The chicken will continue to cook with the vegetables, so it's ok if it seems a little undercooked right now.)\n5 Add the vegetables: When chicken is cooked, add cabbage and carrots, and continue to stir and cook until the veggies wilt and the liquid they release is mostly evaporated, 2 to 3 minutes.\n6 Add the noodles and sauce: Add noodles along with sauce and stir with the chicken and veggies to combine. The sauce should coat the noodles and other ingredients. If the dish seems too dry, add more water.\nTaste and adjust the flavor to your liking.

b'Print\nHow to Make Gravy\nCook time: 15 minutes\nWhen you cook a roast, whether it\'s turkey, chicken, beef, or lamb, you should end up with plenty of browned drippings and fat from the roast when it\'s finished.\nThe "drippings" are browned juices and fat. All of the flavor a gravy you make from the drippings comes from those browned bits. You need fat as a base for the gravy.\nIf you have pan juices, but they haven\'t browned at the bottom of the pan after the roast is done, you can put the empty pan back in the oven. Set the temp to 450 or 500\xc2\xb0F and cook until the juices evaporate and begin to bubble and brown at the bottom of the pan.\nIn this approach to making gravy, we break up the drippings as well as we can with a whisk, but don\'t worry about any browned bits in the gravy itself. If you want, you can pulse the gravy in a blender to make it smoother, but we never bother. The browned bits are the best part!\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nMaking Gravy with Flour\n1 Remove all but 1/4 cup of fat from pan: Remove the roast from the pan. Remove excess fat leaving 4 Tbsp of fat plus juices and browned drippings in the pan.\n2 Scrape up drippings and place pan on stovetop on medium heat: Use a metal spatula to scrape up any drippings that are sticking to the pan. Place the pan on the stovetop on medium high heat.\n3 Sprinkle 4 Tbsp flour onto the drippings. Quickly stir with a wire whisk so that the flour gets incorporated into the drippings. Let the flour brown a bit if you want, before adding liquid in the next step. (You can also start with a slurry of flour and water if you want.)\n4 Whisk while slowly adding liquid: Slowly add stock, water, milk, cream, or a combination to the pan, whisking vigorously to dissolve the flour into liquid.\nAllow the gravy to simmer and thicken, and continue to slowly add liquid until you have about 2 cups of gravy. (You\'ll probably need to add 3 to 4 cups of liquid.)\n5 Season to taste with salt and pepper. (Always taste first before adding more salt! It may not need it.)\n  Making Gravy with Cornstarch\n1 Remove all but 1/4 cup of fat from pan: Remove the roast from the roasting pan. Pour off all but 4 Tbsp of the fat in the pan. If you don\'t have enough fat in the pan, add butter so that you have at least 4 Tbsp of fat in the pan.\n2 Scrape up browned drippings: While the pan is still warm, scrape the bottom of the pan with a metal spatula to loosen any browned drippings that might be stuck to the bottom of the pan.\n3 Place the pan on the stovetop on medium heat. If you are using a roasting pan that won\'t work well on the stovetop, scrape up all of the drippings and fat and put into a large shallow saut\xc3\xa9 pan.\n4 Make cornstarch slurry: Dissolve 4 Tbsp of cornstarch in the minimum amount of water needed to make a thin paste - about 1/2 cup.\n5 Pour the cornstarch slurry into the pan with drippings and use a wire whisk to blend into the drippings.\n6 Whisk while slowly adding liquid: Stir with a wire whisk until the gravy begins to thicken. As the gravy thickens, slowly add stock, water, milk, or cream, or some combination to the pan (I like to use stock, my mother usually uses water).\nAlternate stirring and adding liquid, maintaining the consistency you want, for several minutes (about 5 minutes).\nYou will probably add about 3 to 4 cups of liquid all together. Taking into consideration the evaporation that is occurring while the gravy is simmering, you will end up with about 2 cups of gravy.\nIf the gravy isn\'t thick enough, make more cornstarch slurry and whisk it into the pan.\n7 Season to taste with salt and pepper.\nHello!

b"Print\nTandoori Chicken Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 40 minutesMarinating time: 6 hoursYield: Serves 4-6\nIf you don't have a grill, you can broil the chicken for a few minutes on each side to get some browning, then finish in a 325\xc2\xb0F oven until done.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 Tbsp vegetable oil\n1 teaspoon ground coriander\n1 teaspoon ground cumin\n1 teaspoon ground turmeric\n1 teaspoon cayenne\n1 Tbsp garam masala\n1 Tbsp sweet (not hot) paprika\n1 cup plain yogurt (can sub buttermilk)\n2 Tbsp lemon juice\n4 minced garlic cloves\n2 Tbsp minced fresh ginger\n1 teaspoon salt\n4 whole chicken legs (drumsticks and thighs), or its equivalent, skinless, bone-in\nMETHOD\n1 Heat the spices in oil: Heat the oil in a small pan over medium heat, then cook the coriander, cumin, turmeric, cayenne, garam masala and paprika, stirring often, until fragrant (approximately 2-3 minutes). Let cool completely.\n2 Whisk spices into yogurt, add lemon juice, garlic, salt, ginger: Whisk the cooled spice-oil mixture into the yogurt, then mix in the lemon juice, garlic, salt and ginger.\n3 Cut deep slashes into chicken, coat with marinade, chill: Cut deep slashes (to the bone) in 3-4 places on the leg/thigh pieces. Just make 2-3 cuts if you are using separate drumsticks and thighs. Coat the chicken in the marinade, cover and chill for at least an hour (preferably 6 hours), no more than 8 hours.\n4 Prepare grill: Prepare your grill so that one side is quite hot over direct heat, the other side cooler, not over direct heat. If using charcoal, leave one side of the grill without coals, so you have a hot side and a cooler side. If you are using a gas grill, just turn on one-half of the burners.\nUse tongs to wipe the grill grates with a paper towel soaked in vegetable oil.\n5 Shake off excess marinade, place chicken on hot side of grill: Take the chicken out of the marinade and shake off the excess. You want the chicken coated, but not gloppy.\nPut the chicken pieces on the hot side of the grill and cover. Cook 2-3 minutes before checking.\nTurn the chicken so it is brown (even a little bit charred) on all sides\n6 Move to cool side of grill, cover and cook: Move chicken to the cool side of the grill. Cover and cook for at least 20 minutes, up to 40 minutes (or longer) depending on the size of the chicken and the temperature of the grill. The chicken is done when its juices run clear.\nLet it rest for at least 5 minutes before serving. It\xe2\x80\x99s also great at room temperature or even cold the next day.\nServe with naan, and Indian flatbread, or with Indian style rice, with yogurt-based raita on the side.\nHello!

But you\xe2\x80\x99ll still have delicious wings without it: Omit the baking powder, but still season the wings with the kosher salt before air-frying them.\nIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t find gochujang, try another favorite sauce for chicken wings and use the same air fryer method.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the wings:\n3 pounds chicken wing drumettes and flats\n3 teaspoons baking powder\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\nFor the sauce:\n2 tablespoons gochujang\n2 tablespoons soy sauce\n1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar\n2 teaspoons sesame oil\n1 teaspoon sugar\n3 tablespoons butter, melted and kept warm\nFor the sesame mayonnaise dipping sauce:\n1 cup mayonnaise\n1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil\n3/4 teaspoon sugar\n1/8 teaspoon sriracha\nTo garnish:\nThinly sliced scallions, for garnish\nToasted sesame seeds, for garnish\nThin spears of cucumber\nThin slices of radish\nSpecial equipment:\nAir Fryer\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Season and rest the wings: Pat the wings dry, if needed. In a large bowl, add the wings and toss them with the baking powder and salt until evenly coated.\nSpread the wings around the bowl so they are in a single layer and refrigerate them, uncovered, for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours.\n2 Air fry the wings: Heat the air fryer to 380\xc2\xb0F. Open the drawer and fit as many wings as you can in it without crowding them (for my 4.4-quart air fryer, this was 1-1/2 pounds of wings, or half the batch). Close the drawer. Cook for 25 minutes, shaking the drawer every 5 minutes to shuffle the wings around.\n3 Make the sauce: As the wings cook, make the sauce. In a medium bowl, whisk together the gochujang, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, and sugar. Set aside.\n4 Make the sesame mayonnaise: In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sesame oil, sugar, and sriracha until smooth. Set aside.\n5 Increase the air fryer temp: Once the wings have cooked for 25 minutes, increase the temperature of the air fryer to 400\xc2\xb0F. Cook the wings for another 5 minutes. This gets them nice and brown and especially crispy.\n6 Sauce and serve the wings: Mix the melted butter with the sauce (it might solidify a bit, but the heat of the wings will re-melt it). Add the wings to a large bowl, pour over half the sauce and toss the wings in the sauce.\n7 Serve and eat: Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds, if you like. Serve immediately, accompanied by the cucumbers, radishes, and sesame mayonnaise for dipping.\n8 Cook the remaining wings: Reduce the temperature of your air fryer back to 380\xc2\xb0F. Repeat steps 2 and 4. Toss them with the remaining sauce.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Line a baking sheet with foil and spray with nonstick spray (or brush with oil).\n2 Crush the crackers: Place the crackers in a zip-top plastic bag and seal it. Using your hands, a rolling pin, a mallet, or the hands of your children, crush the Goldfish as much as you can, but don't turn them into flour. You want some inconsistencies in shape; it'll make for better texture.\n3 Prep the assembly line: Find three medium bowls. Stir together the flour, salt, and pepper in one. Whisk the eggs together in the second bowl. Add the crushed Goldfish crackers to the last one.\n4 Bread the chicken: Working with a few pieces of chicken at a time, add to seasoned flour and coat well. Then shake off any extra flour, move to the eggs and coat well, and finally add to crushed Goldfish. Press the Goldfish on so they really stick and form a good crust.\nTransfer coated chicken to the baking sheet. Repeat until all the chicken tenders are coated.\n5 Bake the chicken: Bake chicken tenders for about 20 minutes until they are cooked through, or reach an internal temperature of 165\xc2\xb0F in the thickest part of the tenders. You can also test one of the thicker ones by cutting it in half and making sure it\xe2\x80\x99s cooked through.\nThere\xe2\x80\x99s no need to flip these, but you can flip them halfway through if they are browning too much on one side.\nServe tenders while warm with a veggie and/or side salad and any dips you want, such as ketchup or bbq sauce. My kids loved honey! You can also make the Dad Add and have a sandwich!\nHow to Reheat Leftover Tenders\nYou will probably have leftovers, which will keep for 3 to 4 days in the fridge. They reheat perfectly, but they will get soggy if you reheat them in the microwave. Either reheat them gently in a nonstick skillet over low heat until warmed through, or put them on a baking sheet and reheat them until they\xe2\x80\x99re crispy, 7 to 8 minutes.\nHello!

If it's all you can find, buy the Greek yogurt with the highest fat content you can find and mix it with a little whole milk to get the consistency of regular yogurt. This will give the sauce some insurance against separating.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the chicken:\n1 1/4 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, thighs, or a mix\n6 tablespoons plain whole milk yogurt\n1/2 tablespoon grated ginger\n3 cloves of garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon cumin\n1 teaspoon paprika\n1 1/4 teaspoons salt\nFor the tikka masala sauce:\n2 tablespoons canola oil, divided\n1 small onion, thinly sliced (about 5 ounces, or 1 1/2 cups sliced)\n2 teaspoons grated ginger\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tablespoon ground coriander\n2 teaspoons paprika\n1 teaspoon garam masala\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 (14-ounce) can crushed fire-roasted tomatoes (regular crushed tomatoes work, too)\n6 tablespoons plain whole milk yogurt\n1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nCooked rice, to serve\nCilantro, to garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the chicken: Trim chicken thighs of any extra fat. Chop into bite-sized pieces about 1/2 to 1-inch wide. Place the chicken thigh pieces to a medium bowl.\nAdd the yogurt, ginger, garlic, cumin, paprika and salt. Using your hands, combine the chicken with the spices until the chicken is evenly coated.\n2 Marinate the chicken: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the chicken marinate in the fridge for at least 45 minutes or as long as overnight. (Marinating for 4 to 6 hours is perfect.)\n3 Cook the chicken: In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thigh pieces and cook for about 6 to 7 minutes, until they\xe2\x80\x99re cooked through. Transfer to a plate and set aside.\n4 Toast the spices: Wipe down the pan you used to cook the chicken. Heat remaining canola oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes, until softened, stirring often.\nAdd the grated ginger, minced garlic, coriander, paprika, garam masala, turmeric, black pepper, salt, and cayenne. Let the spices cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds to a minute.\n5 Make the sauce: Add the crushed tomatoes to the pan with the spices and let everything cook for 4 minutes, stirring often.

Cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes or according to package instructions. Scoop out and reserve about 1/2 cup of the pasta-cooking water, and then drain the pasta. Set aside.\n2 Make the Dad Add \xe2\x80\x93 Buttered Breadcrumbs: In a small skillet, melt the butter over low heat. Add breadcrumbs and stir them well so they evenly soak up the butter.\nCook on low heat until the breadcrumbs start to brown, about 3 minutes. Stir occasionally to prevent burning. Watch them closely, as they can go from perfect to burned quickly.\n3 Prep the chicken: Mix together the flour, salt, and pepper in a shallow bowl. Whisk the eggs in a second shallow bowl. Dip the chicken breasts first in the egg and then coat them with the flour mixture. They should have a very light coating on them. Let chicken rest on a plate.\n4 Fry the chicken: Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When the oil sizzles immediately when you sprinkle a little flour in it, it's ready. Add the chicken pieces and cook for 4 to 5 minutes per side (8 to 10 minutes total). Check cooked chicken with a meat thermometer to make sure it reaches an internal temperature of 165\xc2\xb0F.\nRemove chicken from the skillet, and let it rest while you finish the dish.\n5 Make the piccata sauce: Pour out all but about 2 tablespoons of the oil in the skillet, and add the 2 tablespoons butter. Turn the heat down to medium-low, and add onions and sliced garlic. Stir the veggies, cooking for a few minutes until they soften.\nAdd chicken stock and lemon juice, and using a wooden spoon, scrape up any bits stuck to the pan.\n6 Finish the dish: Add the cooked penne to the skillet. Toss the penne with the lemon butter sauce. If the pan seems dry, add enough of the reserved 1/2 cup pasta cooking water so the pasta no longer seems dry.\nAfter the chicken has cooled slightly, chop the skillet fried chicken into big chunks, and add back into the penne mixture. Garnish with fresh parsley and capers.\n7 Garnish and serve: Serve the penne while warm, topping each bowl with the crispy buttered Italian breadcrumbs.\nThis dish keeps great in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. If you can plan ahead on the portion you will keep for leftovers, it\xe2\x80\x99s best to actually store the chicken and pasta separately. Otherwise, the chicken will get soggy. Reheat the chicken in a 350\xc2\xb0F oven for about 8 minutes, and then chop and add to reheated penne pasta.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Toss all the ingredients together when adding the sauce and cook until the chicken is cooked through.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the chicken:\n1 1/2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breast\n1 large egg\n1 tablespoon cornstarch\nFor the stir fry sauce:\n1 1/2 cups chicken stock\n3 tablespoons soy sauce\n2 tablespoons corn starch\n1 tablespoon hoisin sauce\n1 tablespoon oyster sauce\n1/2 teaspoon Chinese five spice powder\nPinch of ground white pepper\nFor the vegetables:\n1 tablespoon vegetable oil\n3 carrots, peeled and sliced thinly on a diagonal\n3/4  cup (3 ounces) snow peas\n2 teaspoons grated fresh garlic\n1 teaspoons grated fresh ginger\n2 cups (5 ounces) shiitake (or white button) mushrooms, sliced\n1/3 cup (4 ounces) canned water chestnuts, drained\n1/3 cup (4 ounces) canned bamboo shoots, drained\nKosher salt, to taste\nTo serve:\n6 cups cooked jasmine rice\nSpecial equipment:\nWok, or large skillet\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the chicken: Using a sharp knife, slice each chicken breast in half lengthwise from the thin tip to the wider end, creating into two long strips. Thinly slice each strip against the grain into bite-sized pieces.\nThe goal here is to create bite-sized pieces of chicken that are all about the same size and shape. However you end up with that, you're good to go!\n2 Mix the cornstarch and soak the chicken: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the egg and 1 tablespoon of the cornstarch until smooth. Toss the sliced chicken breast in the egg mixture to coat thoroughly. Allow the chicken to soak in the mixture while you prepare your sauce.\n3 Make the stir fry sauce: In a separate bowl, combine the chicken stock, 2 tablespoons cornstarch, soy, hoisin, and oyster sauces, the five spice powder, and white pepper. Whisk the mixture together and set aside.\n4 Preheat the wok and arrange your ingredients: Begin preheating your wok, or a large, deep skillet, over high heat and turn on your stovetop\xe2\x80\x99s ventilation fan. Drain the chicken of any excess egg mixture and return the chicken to its bowl.\nArrange your ingredients next to the stove in the following order: vegetable oil, chicken, carrots and snow peas, garlic and ginger, mushrooms, water chestnuts and bamboo shoots, and mixed sauce. This will help things go quickly once you\xe2\x80\x99ve begun cooking.\n5 Cook the chicken: When the wok has heated (a flick of water should evaporate on contact), carefully add the vegetable oil, quickly followed by the chicken. Stir fry the chicken for 4 minutes, tossing occasionally with a wooden spoon.\n6 Stir fry the veggies: Add the carrots and snow peas and cook for an additional 4 minutes, stirring often. Make a well in the center of the pan and add the garlic and ginger. Cook in the center of the pan until fragrant, for about 1 minute, and then mix them in with the rest of the ingredients.\nAdd the mushrooms, chestnuts, and bamboo shoots. Cook, stirring occasionally, for 3 minutes.\n7 Add the sauce: Make another well in the center of the pan and add the sauce. Cook for 2 minutes, or until the sauce starts to bubble and thicken slightly.\nFold the stir fry ingredients into the sauce to coat completely. Bring the sauce up to a simmer, and then reduce the heat to low. Cook for a minute longer.\n8 Serve: Remove from heat and immediately serve spooned over the jasmine rice with extra hoisin sauce on the side.\nLeftovers are best stored apart from the rice in an airtight container in the fridge for two days.

Add the chicken, spices, zest, lemon juice, garlic and olive oil.\nRemove as much air as possible and seal the bag. Smoosh the chicken around so it\xe2\x80\x99s coated in the marinade.\n3 Lay the chicken flat in the freezer and freeze for up to 6 months:\nAlternatively, you could skip the freezer and let it marinade in the fridge for a couple of hours and up to two days, then cook it according to the directions below.\n 4 Thaw the chicken before cooking: When ready to cook, take the chicken out of the freezer in the morning before you go to work, and it will be ready to cook by the end of the day.\n5 Prepare the vegetables: If the b-sized potatoes are larger than a golf ball, quarter them; if they are smaller just half them. Slice the onion. Wash the Swiss chard, remove the stems and chop them. Then cut the leaves into strips about an inch thick. Cut the olives in half.\n  6 Cook the chicken: Set a large skillet over medium heat add 2 teaspoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Once the oil shimmers and the butter melts, add the chicken and any marinade in the bag.\nIf any chicken is folded up, unfold it so it lays flat in the pan. Cook the chicken for 2 minutes, then flip it.\n7 Add the vegetables: Add the potatoes, onion, and 1/4 cup water to the pan with the chicken. Cover with a lid. Let everything simmer together for about 10 minutes.\n8 Finish the potatoes and make the sauce: Remove the chicken to a plate (leaving the vegetables in the skillet) and tent with foil. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a few cracks of freshly ground pepper to the skillet. Stir the potatoes, cover and cook for another 10 minutes.\nTurn the heat up to medium high to reduce the liquid and finish cooking the potatoes uncovered. This should take about 2 to 3 minutes depending on how much liquid is in the pan.\nWhen you can easily pierce the potatoes with a fork, add the chard leaves and chopped stems, olives, and red wine vinegar. Toss gently until the greens are just wilted.\n9 Serve: Nestle the chicken back into the pan. Bring the whole thing over to the table and serve.\nHello!

Set aside.\n2 Prep the chicken: Cut chicken into about 1-inch cubes. Whisk eggs with salt and black pepper in a bowl and add chicken. Stir together.\nIn a separate bowl, whisk together flour and cornstarch. Remove chicken from eggs with a slotted spoon or tongs, letting excess egg drain off, then transfer to cornstarch mixture and coat well.\n2 Fry the chicken: Add oil to a large 10- to 12-inch skillet. Heat over medium-high heat until it reaches 350\xcb\x9aF. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a thermometer, you can also test the temperature by sprinkling in some flour and it should fizzle immediately.\nOnce oil is hot, fry the chicken in two batches. The oil might not completely cover the chicken\xe2\x80\x94that\xe2\x80\x99s okay. Cook for 3-4 minutes. Flip the chicken pieces and cook until the chicken is cooked through, about 3 to 4 more minutes. Total cook time is about 6-8 minutes.\nRemove fried chicken cubes and transfer to a plate lined with paper towels, so the chicken can drain. Repeat until all the chicken is cooked.\n3 Simmer the chicken in the sauce: Once chicken is done, pour out hot oil and wipe pan clean. Add a fresh tablespoon of oil along with chopped garlic and shallot. Cook for a minute and then add the sauce. Simmer the sauce until it starts to thicken.\nOnce the sauce is lightly bubbling, add fried chicken and toss together to coat. The sauce should continue to thicken and stick to the chicken. Let simmer for a minute or two more. Serve orange chicken over cooked white rice, garnished with sesame seeds and fresh scallions.\nLEFTOVERS! The orange chicken keeps well in the fridge for 5 days. Reheat in a skillet with a splash of water over low heat. Freeze the orange chicken for up to 3 months, but be sure to thaw it before reheating so the chicken doesn\xe2\x80\x99t clump together.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nClassic Baked Chicken\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 50 minutesYield: Serves 4\nEven if you intend to eat the baked chicken without its skin, leave the skin on for baking because it prevents the chicken pieces from drying out while they bake.\nIf you bought a whole chicken to start with, the chicken may have come with the neck and gizzards (often in paper in the cavity of the chicken). Use the chicken back and these giblets to make stock for gravy. Chop up the back a little, and put the back, gizzard, and neck into a small saucepan and cover with water by a half inch or so. Bring to a simmer and let simmer while your chicken is baking. Then strain and use the stock for making a richly flavored gravy.\nINGREDIENTS\nOne 3 to 4 pound chicken, cut into 8 parts (2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 legs, 2 wings), excluding the back\nExtra virgin olive oil\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/2 cup low sodium chicken stock (see Recipe Note) or white wine for the gravy (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Trim and salt the chicken: Trim the chicken pieces of excess fat. Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle all sides with salt. Let the chicken pieces sit for 15 to 20 minutes to take the chill off.\n2 Preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C).\n3 Prep the chicken: Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel. Rub olive oil over the chicken pieces and on the bottom of the roasting pan.\nSprinkle the chicken pieces all over with black pepper and a little more salt.\nArrange the chicken pieces in the pan so that all the pieces are skin-side up, and the largest pieces (the breasts) are in the center of the pan.\nDon't crowd the pan; allow room in between the pieces.\n4 Bake the chicken: Bake (uncovered) in the oven for 30 minutes at 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C). This initial high heat will help brown the chicken.\nThen lower the heat to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) and bake for and additional 10-30 minutes more until the juices run clear (not pink) when poked with a sharp knife or the internal temperature of the chicken breasts is 165\xc2\xb0F (74\xc2\xb0C), and of the thighs is 170\xc2\xb0F (77\xc2\xb0C) when tested with a meat thermometer.\nIf the chicken isn't browning well enough, place the chicken under the broiler for the last 5 minutes of cooking, until browned sufficiently.\n5 Let it rest: Remove from oven and transfer the chicken to a serving dish. Tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.\n6 Make gravy: If you would like to make gravy with the drippings from the chicken, place the roasting pan with all its drippings on the stovetop and set the burner to medium heat.\nUse a metal spatula to scrape up the stuck drippings from the bottom of the pan. When the pan is hot, pour in some white wine or chicken stock to help loosen the drippings from the pan.\nTransfer the drippings and stock/wine mixture to a saucepan and heat on medium high until reduced to your desired thickness.\nIf you want the gravy even thicker, you can make a slurry with a little cornstarch or flour (a teaspoon) and water (1/4 cup), and add that to the gravy while it cooks.\n7 Serve: Serve with steamed rice, mashed potatoes, or Spanish rice.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nAir Fryer Fried Chicken Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 45 minutesMarinating time: 1 hourYield: 10 pieces of fried chicken\nAlternative Pan Fry Method: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to an air fryer, you can make this fried chicken using a traditional pan fry method. Add enough oil to a cast iron skillet so the oil is about 1 1/2 inches up the side of the skillet. Heat oil until it reaches 350\xc2\xb0F. Add chicken pieces and fry for 8 minutes. Flip, and fry for another 8 minutes until golden brown. Test temperature; you might need a few more minutes for the dark meat pieces (thighs and legs).\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the chicken: \n1 4-pound fryer chicken, cut into 10 pieces (2 breasts cut in half, 2 wings, 2 legs, 2 thighs)\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 cups buttermilk\nFor the coating:\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 tablespoon seasoned salt\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon garlic powder\n1 tablespoon paprika\nSpray olive oil for cooking\nSpecial equipment:\nKrups Air Fryer\nThermapen Instant Read Thermometer\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Marinate the chicken: Season the chicken well with salt and pepper and then add it to a bowl with buttermilk. Chicken pieces should be covered with the buttermilk. Let it sit for at least an hour or up to overnight.\n2 Bread the chicken: To prepare the breading mixture, stir together flour, seasoned salt, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika.\nRemove chicken pieces from buttermilk and shake off any excess; then dip in the flour mix and coat well. Transfer breaded chicken pieces to a clean plate or wire rack to rest.\n3 Air-fry the chicken: You will need to work in two batches if you are doing a full chicken. Spray the basket of your air fryer with nonstick spray. Place half of the pieces in the basket of your air fryer. Try to ensure the pieces don\xe2\x80\x99t touch. Air needs to circulate around them.\nSpray the chicken pieces lightly with spray oil. Place the basket in the air fryer and turn the air fryer to 350\xc2\xb0F. Cook for 14 minutes, then flip the fried chicken with tongs, spray lightly with oil a second time on the bottom side of the chicken, and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes.\nThe half-breast pieces and the wings will be done on the low end of that time range, and the dark meat pieces will need a full 24 to 26 minutes of time to be cooked through. The dark meat pieces should reach 175\xcb\x9aF.\n(NOTE: My method photo here only shows the temp at 148\xcb\x9aF to illustrate that the chicken can LOOK cooked but is actually not cooked through. A meat thermometer is vital.)\nDuring the air frying process, if you pull out the chicken and notice any dry flour spots on the chicken, spray those spots lightly with oil. The breading will never crisp up if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a tiny bit of oil to hydrate it. It will just burn.\n4 Serve: When the fried chicken is ready, let it rest on a plate for a few minutes before serving. Serve immediately with salad, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, or your favorite fried chicken sides!\nCooked fried chicken can be stored in the fridge for 5 days and reheated in a 300\xc2\xb0F oven for 8 to 10 minutes.\nHello!

If the thighs are large or super uneven in thickness, butterfly each one. Lay the thigh, smooth-side down, on your cutting board. Wielding your knife horizontally, slash the big mound of flesh to create a flap of meat, stopping just shy of cutting all the way through. Fold back the meat flap that you just created. The thigh should now be about 50 percent longer and relatively even in thickness. If the result seems awkwardly large, cut it crosswise into two smaller, square-ish pieces.

b'Print\nQuick Chicken Pho Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: Serves 2\nFrom Andrea:\n"Great for pho beginners, this recipe is also terrific for cooks in a hurry. It involves less than 45 minutes, during which you\xe2\x80\x99ll doctor up store-bought broth so it says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pho-ish.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe keys to this streamlined approach include toasting spices and dry saut\xc3\xa9ing the ginger and green onion, which help to extract flavor fast. Poaching the chicken in the broth adds savory depth. You\xe2\x80\x99ll practice some fundamental pho techniques that you can apply elsewhere, too. Choose a broth that tastes like chicken, such as Swanson brand, which is less fussed up and easy to manipulate. You need two 14.5-ounce (411 g) cans or one 32-ounce (907 ml) carton."\nReprinted with permission from The Pho Cookbook: Easy to Adventurous Recipes for Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s Favorite Soup and Noodles by Andrea Nguyen, copyright \xc2\xa9 2017. Published by Ten Speed Press, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC.\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4-inch (2 cm) section ginger\n2 medium-large green onions\n1 very small (.5 oz | 15 g) bunch cilantro sprigs\n1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds\n1 whole clove\n3 1/2 to 4 cups (840 ml to 1 l) low-sodium chicken broth\n2 cups (480 ml) water\n6 to 8 ounces (180 to 225 g) boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs\nAbout 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n5 ounces (150 g) dried narrow flat rice noodles\n2 to 3 teaspoons fish sauce\nAbout 1/2 teaspoon organic sugar, or 1 teaspoon maple syrup (optional)\nPepper (optional)\nOptional extras: Bean sprouts, mint sprigs, Thai basil, cilantro leaves, lime wedges, thinly-sliced chili peppers\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the broth ingredients: Peel then slice the ginger into 4 or 5 coins. Smack with the flat side of a knife or meat mallet; set aside. Thinly slice the green parts of the green onion to yield 2 to 3 tablespoons; set aside for garnish. Cut the leftover sections into pinkie-finger lengths, bruise, then add to the ginger.\nCoarsely chop the leafy tops of the cilantro to yield 2 tablespoons; set aside for garnish. Set the remaining cilantro sprigs aside.\n2 Toast the broth ingredients: In a 3- to 4-quart (3 to 4 l) pot, toast the coriander seeds and clove over medium heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the ginger and green onion sections. Stir for about 30 seconds, until aromatic.\n3 Add the broth and bring to a simmer: Slide the pot off heat, wait 15 seconds or so to briefly cool, then pour in the broth.\nReturn the pot to the burner, then add the water, cilantro sprigs, chicken, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to gently simmer.\n4 Remove the chicken from the broth once cooked: After 5 to 10 minutes of simmering, the chicken should be firm and cooked through (press on it and it should slightly yield).\n5 Continue to simmer the broth without the chicken for another 15 to 20 minutes (for a total of 30 minutes simmering time).\n6 Shred the chicken: Transfer the chicken to a bowl, flush with cold water to arrest the cooking, then drain. Let cool, then cut or shred into bite-size pieces. Cover loosely to prevent drying.\n[Emma\'s note: If the chicken isn\'t quite cooked through when you begin to shred it, just split it into a few pieces and put it back in the broth for another few minutes until cooked through. The split pieces will quickly cook through.]\n7 Soak the rice noodles in hot water until pliable and opaque. Drain, rinse, and set aside.\n8 Strain the broth: When the broth is done, pour it through a fine-mesh strainer positioned over a 2-quart (2-liter) pot; line the strainer with muslin for superclear broth. Discard the solids. You should have about 4 cups.\nSeason with fish sauce and sugar (or maple syrup), if needed, to create a strong savory-sweet note.\n9 Finish the pho: Bring the strained broth to a boil over high heat. Put the noodles in a noodle strainer or mesh sieve and dunk in the hot broth to heat and soften, 5 to 60 seconds. Lift the noodles from the pot and divide between the 2 bowls.

Add the chicken pieces and coat completely with the marinade. Cover and let marinate, refrigerated, several hours or overnight.\n2 Place chicken in baking pan, top with marinade, brown sugar, wine: Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Arrange chicken in a single layer in one or two large, shallow baking pans and spoon marinade over it evenly. Sprinkle brown sugar over the chicken pieces and pour white wine around them.\n3 Bake until done: Bake for 50 minutes to 1 hour, basting frequently with the pan juices. Chicken is done when a sharp knife inserted into the thigh pieces, at their thickest point, run with clear yellow juices (not pink).\n4 Serve with pan juices: With a slotted spoon, move the chicken, prunes, olives, and capers to a serving platter. Pour some of the pan juices over the chicken and sprinkle generously with parsley. Serve remaining juices in a gravy boat.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

I take chicken off the grill at a little bit lower temp (155\xc2\xb0F) than is usually recommended for poultry, but that's because the chicken will continue to cook for several minutes once it's off the heat and resting. Taking the chicken off the heat at this temperature helps insure that the meat doesn't overcook and get dried out. If you feel more comfortable taking the chicken off the heat at a higher internal temperature, please feel free to do so.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the brine:\n4 cups water\n1/4 cup Diamond Crystal kosher salt (or 3 tablespoons sea salt or Morton's kosher salt)\nFor the chicken:\n1 1/2 to 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts\n3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil (plus more olive oil for the grill)\n1 1/2 teaspoons paprika\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brine the chicken breast: In a large bowl, whisk the salt in the water to dissolve. Add the chicken breasts to the brine. Put in the refrigerator and chill for 30 minutes.\n2 Prepare your grill: Arrange your grill so that one side is for high direct heat, and the other side is cooler. Alternatively, you can use a grill pan, set over medium-high heat.\n3 Coat chicken with oil and paprika: Remove chicken breasts from brine and pat dry. Coat with olive oil, and sprinkle evenly with paprika.\n4 Grill the chicken breasts: Brush some olive oil on the grill grates. Place chicken breasts on the hot side of the grill (or on the grill pan). Let the chicken grill, undisturbed, until the pieces start getting some grill marks (you can lift up one to check).\nWhen the chicken pieces have browned on one side, turn them over, and move them to the cooler side of the grill. Cover, and let them finish cooking.\nRemove chicken from grill when the internal temperature of the chicken reaches 155\xc2\xb0F.\n5 Let the chicken breasts rest: Cover the breasts with foil. The chicken will continue to cook in its residual heat while it rests. Let it rest 5 to 10 minutes before cutting and serving.\nServe with grilled peppers, pineapple salsa, or just a squeeze of lime!\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nChicken Tikka Masala Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nLeftover chicken tikka masala tastes phenomenal the next day because the spices develop more flavor overnight.\nAvoid using Greek yogurt if possible for this recipe. If it's all you can find, buy the Greek yogurt with the highest fat content you can find and mix it with a little whole milk to get the consistency of regular yogurt. This will give the sauce some insurance against separating.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the chicken:\n1 1/4 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts, thighs, or a mix\n6 tablespoons plain whole milk yogurt\n1/2 tablespoon grated ginger\n3 cloves of garlic, minced\n1 teaspoon cumin\n1 teaspoon paprika\n1 1/4 teaspoons salt\nFor the tikka masala sauce:\n2 tablespoons canola oil, divided\n1 small onion, thinly sliced (about 5 ounces, or 1 1/2 cups sliced)\n2 teaspoons grated ginger\n4 cloves garlic, minced\n1 tablespoon ground coriander\n2 teaspoons paprika\n1 teaspoon garam masala\n1/2 teaspoon turmeric\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 (14-ounce) can crushed fire-roasted tomatoes (regular crushed tomatoes work, too)\n6 tablespoons plain whole milk yogurt\n1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon cayenne pepper\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nCooked rice, to serve\nCilantro, to garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the chicken: Trim chicken thighs of any extra fat. Chop into bite-sized pieces about 1/2 to 1-inch wide. Place the chicken thigh pieces to a medium bowl.\nAdd the yogurt, ginger, garlic, cumin, paprika and salt. Using your hands, combine the chicken with the spices until the chicken is evenly coated.\n2 Marinate the chicken: Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the chicken marinate in the fridge for at least 45 minutes or as long as overnight. (Marinating for 4 to 6 hours is perfect.)\n3 Cook the chicken: In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of canola oil over medium-high heat. Add the chicken thigh pieces and cook for about 6 to 7 minutes, until they\xe2\x80\x99re cooked through. Transfer to a plate and set aside.\n4 Toast the spices: Wipe down the pan you used to cook the chicken. Heat remaining canola oil over medium heat. Add the onions and cook for 5 minutes, until softened, stirring often.\nAdd the grated ginger, minced garlic, coriander, paprika, garam masala, turmeric, black pepper, salt, and cayenne. Let the spices cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds to a minute.\n5 Make the sauce: Add the crushed tomatoes to the pan with the spices and let everything cook for 4 minutes, stirring often. Add the yogurt and stir to combine.\n6 Simmer the sauce: Reduce the heat to medium-low and let the sauce simmer for another 4 minutes. Add the chicken pieces to the pan and coat with sauce.\n7 Serve: Serve over cooked basmati rice and garnish with cilantro.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Let everything simmer together for about 10 minutes.\n8 Finish the potatoes and make the sauce: Remove the chicken to a plate (leaving the vegetables in the skillet) and tent with foil. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a few cracks of freshly ground pepper to the skillet. Stir the potatoes, cover and cook for another 10 minutes.\nTurn the heat up to medium high to reduce the liquid and finish cooking the potatoes uncovered. This should take about 2 to 3 minutes depending on how much liquid is in the pan.\nWhen you can easily pierce the potatoes with a fork, add the chard leaves and chopped stems, olives, and red wine vinegar. Toss gently until the greens are just wilted.\n9 Serve: Nestle the chicken back into the pan. Bring the whole thing over to the table and serve.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nClassic Baked Chicken\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 50 minutesYield: Serves 4\nEven if you intend to eat the baked chicken without its skin, leave the skin on for baking because it prevents the chicken pieces from drying out while they bake.\nIf you bought a whole chicken to start with, the chicken may have come with the neck and gizzards (often in paper in the cavity of the chicken). Use the chicken back and these giblets to make stock for gravy. Chop up the back a little, and put the back, gizzard, and neck into a small saucepan and cover with water by a half inch or so. Bring to a simmer and let simmer while your chicken is baking. Then strain and use the stock for making a richly flavored gravy.\nINGREDIENTS\nOne 3 to 4 pound chicken, cut into 8 parts (2 breasts, 2 thighs, 2 legs, 2 wings), excluding the back\nExtra virgin olive oil\nKosher salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/2 cup low sodium chicken stock (see Recipe Note) or white wine for the gravy (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Trim and salt the chicken: Trim the chicken pieces of excess fat. Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel. Sprinkle all sides with salt. Let the chicken pieces sit for 15 to 20 minutes to take the chill off.\n2 Preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C).\n3 Prep the chicken: Pat the chicken pieces dry with a paper towel. Rub olive oil over the chicken pieces and on the bottom of the roasting pan.\nSprinkle the chicken pieces all over with black pepper and a little more salt.\nArrange the chicken pieces in the pan so that all the pieces are skin-side up, and the largest pieces (the breasts) are in the center of the pan.\nDon't crowd the pan; allow room in between the pieces.\n4 Bake the chicken: Bake (uncovered) in the oven for 30 minutes at 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C). This initial high heat will help brown the chicken.\nThen lower the heat to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) and bake for and additional 10-30 minutes more until the juices run clear (not pink) when poked with a sharp knife or the internal temperature of the chicken breasts is 165\xc2\xb0F (74\xc2\xb0C), and of the thighs is 170\xc2\xb0F (77\xc2\xb0C) when tested with a meat thermometer.\nIf the chicken isn't browning well enough, place the chicken under the broiler for the last 5 minutes of cooking, until browned sufficiently.\n5 Let it rest: Remove from oven and transfer the chicken to a serving dish. Tent with aluminum foil and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving.\n6 Make gravy: If you would like to make gravy with the drippings from the chicken, place the roasting pan with all its drippings on the stovetop and set the burner to medium heat.\nUse a metal spatula to scrape up the stuck drippings from the bottom of the pan. When the pan is hot, pour in some white wine or chicken stock to help loosen the drippings from the pan.\nTransfer the drippings and stock/wine mixture to a saucepan and heat on medium high until reduced to your desired thickness.\nIf you want the gravy even thicker, you can make a slurry with a little cornstarch or flour (a teaspoon) and water (1/4 cup), and add that to the gravy while it cooks.\n7 Serve: Serve with steamed rice, mashed potatoes, or Spanish rice.\nHello!

It involves less than 45 minutes, during which you\xe2\x80\x99ll doctor up store-bought broth so it says, \xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m pho-ish.\xe2\x80\x9d\nThe keys to this streamlined approach include toasting spices and dry saut\xc3\xa9ing the ginger and green onion, which help to extract flavor fast. Poaching the chicken in the broth adds savory depth. You\xe2\x80\x99ll practice some fundamental pho techniques that you can apply elsewhere, too. Choose a broth that tastes like chicken, such as Swanson brand, which is less fussed up and easy to manipulate. You need two 14.5-ounce (411 g) cans or one 32-ounce (907 ml) carton."\nReprinted with permission from The Pho Cookbook: Easy to Adventurous Recipes for Vietnam\xe2\x80\x99s Favorite Soup and Noodles by Andrea Nguyen, copyright \xc2\xa9 2017. Published by Ten Speed Press, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC.\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4-inch (2 cm) section ginger\n2 medium-large green onions\n1 very small (.5 oz | 15 g) bunch cilantro sprigs\n1 1/2 teaspoons coriander seeds\n1 whole clove\n3 1/2 to 4 cups (840 ml to 1 l) low-sodium chicken broth\n2 cups (480 ml) water\n6 to 8 ounces (180 to 225 g) boneless, skinless chicken breast or thighs\nAbout 1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt\n5 ounces (150 g) dried narrow flat rice noodles\n2 to 3 teaspoons fish sauce\nAbout 1/2 teaspoon organic sugar, or 1 teaspoon maple syrup (optional)\nPepper (optional)\nOptional extras: Bean sprouts, mint sprigs, Thai basil, cilantro leaves, lime wedges, thinly-sliced chili peppers\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the broth ingredients: Peel then slice the ginger into 4 or 5 coins. Smack with the flat side of a knife or meat mallet; set aside. Thinly slice the green parts of the green onion to yield 2 to 3 tablespoons; set aside for garnish. Cut the leftover sections into pinkie-finger lengths, bruise, then add to the ginger.\nCoarsely chop the leafy tops of the cilantro to yield 2 tablespoons; set aside for garnish. Set the remaining cilantro sprigs aside.\n2 Toast the broth ingredients: In a 3- to 4-quart (3 to 4 l) pot, toast the coriander seeds and clove over medium heat until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add the ginger and green onion sections. Stir for about 30 seconds, until aromatic.\n3 Add the broth and bring to a simmer: Slide the pot off heat, wait 15 seconds or so to briefly cool, then pour in the broth.\nReturn the pot to the burner, then add the water, cilantro sprigs, chicken, and salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then lower the heat to gently simmer.\n4 Remove the chicken from the broth once cooked: After 5 to 10 minutes of simmering, the chicken should be firm and cooked through (press on it and it should slightly yield).\n5 Continue to simmer the broth without the chicken for another 15 to 20 minutes (for a total of 30 minutes simmering time).\n6 Shred the chicken: Transfer the chicken to a bowl, flush with cold water to arrest the cooking, then drain. Let cool, then cut or shred into bite-size pieces. Cover loosely to prevent drying.\n[Emma\'s note: If the chicken isn\'t quite cooked through when you begin to shred it, just split it into a few pieces and put it back in the broth for another few minutes until cooked through. The split pieces will quickly cook through.]\n7 Soak the rice noodles in hot water until pliable and opaque. Drain, rinse, and set aside.\n8 Strain the broth: When the broth is done, pour it through a fine-mesh strainer positioned over a 2-quart (2-liter) pot; line the strainer with muslin for superclear broth. Discard the solids. You should have about 4 cups.\nSeason with fish sauce and sugar (or maple syrup), if needed, to create a strong savory-sweet note.\n9 Finish the pho: Bring the strained broth to a boil over high heat. Put the noodles in a noodle strainer or mesh sieve and dunk in the hot broth to heat and soften, 5 to 60 seconds. Lift the noodles from the pot and divide between the 2 bowls. [Emma\'s note: I didn\'t find it necessary to soften my noodles any further. I just added them to the bowls and poured the hot broth over top. However, dunking them in the broth would make them more flavorful!]\nLower the heat to keep the broth hot while you arrange the chicken on top of the noodles and garnish with the chopped green onion, cilantro, and a sprinkling of pepper. Taste and adjust the broth\xe2\x80\x99s saltiness one last time. Return the broth to a boil and ladle into the bowls.

Stir to coat the chicken evenly. Let sit for 15 minutes at room temperature or up to overnight in the refrigerator.\n2 Make sweet sour sauce: Whisk together the pineapple juice, vinegar, ketchup, salt, and brown sugar.\n3 Stir-fry chicken: Heat a large frying pan or wok over high heat until a bead of water instantly sizzles and evaporates. Pour in the 1 tablespoon of cooking oil and swirl to coat. It\'s important that the pan is very hot.\nAdd the chicken and spread the chicken out in one layer. Let the chicken fry, untouched for 1 minute, until the bottoms are browned.\nFlip and fry the other side the same for 1 minute. The chicken should still be pinkish in the middle. Dish out the chicken onto a clean plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.\n4 Stir fry bell pepper and ginger: Turn the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 teaspoon of cooking oil. Let the oil heat up and then add the bell pepper chunks and ginger. Fry for 1 minute.\n5 Add pineapple, sweet sour sauce, let simmer, add chicken: Add the pineapple chunks and the sweet and sour sauce. Turn the heat to high and when the sauce is simmering, add the chicken pieces back in.\nLet simmer for 1-2 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Timing depends on how thick you\'ve cut your chicken. The best way to tell if the chicken is done is to take a piece out and cut into it. If it\'s pink, add another minute to the cooking.\nTaste the sauce and add more brown sugar if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nMango Chicken Curry Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 6\nMangoes that are slightly unripe, on the firm side, will hold up better in this recipe, but won't be as sweet as ripe mangoes. So, if you use firm, less than perfectly ripe mangoes, you may need to balance the recipe with more sugar or raisins. If you use sweet mangoes, you may need to balance the recipe with a little more vinegar.\nI highly recommend using full-fat coconut milk for this recipe (or any recipe that calls for coconut milk). Low fat coconut milk doesn't taste good. If you must use low fat coconut milk, add 2 Tbsp of heavy whipping cream to the recipe at the end.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons vegetable oil\n1 large onion, chopped (1 1/2 to 2 cups)\n1/2 red bell pepper, chopped\n2 garlic cloves, minced\n2 tablespoons fresh minced ginger\n2 tablespoons yellow curry powder\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n2 mangos, peeled and diced\n2 tablespoons cider vinegar or white vinegar\n1  13.5-ounce can (full-fat) coconut milk\n1 1/4 pound skinless boneless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1-inch pieces\n1/3 cup golden raisins (optional)\nSalt and pepper\nCilantro for garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook onions, bell pepper, garlic, ginger, spices: Heat oil in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium heat. Add onions and bell pepper cook, stirring occasionally, until soft, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the garlic and ginger and cook for another minute.\nAdd the curry powder and cumin, cook for a few more minutes. The spices will absorb some of the oil, so if anything begins to stick too much to the bottom of the pan, add a little more oil to the pan.\n2 Add the vinegar, coconut milk, and one of the two chopped mangoes to the pan. Increase the heat and bring to a boil, then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer for about 15 minutes, stirring occasionally.\n3 Pur\xc3\xa9e sauce: Remove pan from heat. Scoop the sauce into a blender. Pur\xc3\xa9e the sauce, pulsing until smooth. Return the sauce to the pan.\n4 Add chicken pieces and raisins to the pan. Return to a low simmer. Cover the pan and let cook for 8-10 minutes. Chicken should be just cooked through. Use a knife to cut open the largest piece to check.\n5 Add remaining chopped mango to the pan. Stir in the cream, if using. Let cook at a very low temperature for another minute or two, uncovered. Do not let boil! Or the cream may curdle.\n6 Adjust seasonings: If a little too sweet, add a little more vinegar. If not sweet enough, you can add a dash of sugar. Add salt and pepper to taste.\nServe over rice.

We like Muir Glen brand crushed tomatoes (fire roasted or with basil), or Italian San Marzano tomatoes.\nGrating the onion will create smaller onion pieces and release more of the onion's juices, and is faster than chopping.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the sauce:\n1/2 large yellow onion, grated (don't cut onion in half, just grate half of a whole onion), about 3/4 cup of grated onion\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n2 medium garlic cloves, minced\n1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes\n1 teaspoon dried oregano\nPinch red pepper flakes\nPinch sugar\nFor the chicken:\n4 chicken breast cutlets (1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pounds)\nSalt\n2 large eggs\n1 cup breadcrumbs, Panko or homemade\n1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced\n8 ounces mozzarella cheese, sliced\nTo serve:\nCooked spaghetti, or sub rolls\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Start the sauce: Heat the olive oil in a saucepan on medium-high heat. Add the onions and saut\xc3\xa9 for 2 to 3 minutes. Add the minced garlic. Cook until fragrant, about a minute more.\nThen add the crushed tomatoes, oregano, red pepper flakes, and sugar. Bring to a simmer; reduce the heat to maintain the simmer. Cook, uncovered while you prepare the chicken (about 10 to 12 minutes).\n2 Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F.\n3 Pound cutlets thin: Place the chicken cutlets one at a time between two layers of plastic wrap or wax paper. Use a meat hammer, mallet, rolling pin, or even a heavy empty wine bottle to pound or roll the chicken pieces to an even thickness of 1/4 to 1/2-inch. Sprinkle salt on both sides of the cutlets.\n4 Prepare breadcrumbs and eggs for dredging: In a shallow bowl (large enough to dredge the cutlets), mix together the breadcrumbs, 1/2 cup Parmesan, and pinch of salt. In separate shallow bowl, whisk together the eggs.\n5 Dredge cutlets and brown them: Heat 1/4 cup olive oil in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium-high heat until the oil is shimmering (not smoking) and a piece of breading dropped into it sizzles.\nWorking one cutlet at a time, dip the chicken cutlet into the egg mixture and then into the breadcrumbs. Working in batches as to not crowd the pan, place the dredged cutlets into the pan.\nLower the heat to medium and gently fry the chicken cutlets until they are golden brown on each side, about 3 to 4 minutes per side.\n6 Prep the chicken for the oven: Spread enough tomato sauce to thickly coat the bottom of a 9x13 casserole pan or baking dish. Once the cutlets are browned on both sides, arrange them on top of the tomato sauce in the baking dish.\nSpoon tomato sauce over each of the cutlets. Sprinkle the tops with sliced basil. Then lay slices of mozzarella over each cutlet and sprinkle with the remaining 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese.\n7 Bake: Bake in the oven at 400\xc2\xb0F for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the mozzarella begins to brown.\n8 Serve: Serve with pasta and the remaining sauce, or in a large roll.\nHello!

Add the chicken breast (cut into large chunks) and return the water to a simmer. Then turn off the heat, and cover the pot. Let the chicken sit for 15 minutes (time it) or more while you prepare everything else.\n2 Make the dressing: Prepare the chicken salad dressing in a large bowl. Mix together the mayonnaise, preserves, and lemon juice. Taste for the proper balance of sweetness and acidity. The salad dressing should not be too sweet, nor too sour.\nAdd more preserves or lemon juice until you have reached the balance you want. Add salt and pepper to taste.\n3 Mix in the chopped celery, bell pepper, olives, red onion, and apple.\n4 Dice the chicken, mix with dressing and vegetables: Remove the chicken from the poaching water and dice it.

Patting the chicken pieces dry will help the chicken pieces have crispy breading when baked.\n3 Prepare melted butter and breadcrumbs: In a small bowl, stir the minced garlic into the melted butter. In another bowl mix together the breadcrumbs, Parmesan, parsley, salt, garlic salt, Italian seasoning, and pepper.\n4 Dredge chicken pieces in butter and Parmesan mixture: Piece by piece, dip the chicken pieces into the garlic melted butter, and then dredge into the Parmesan breadcrumb mixture to coat.\nNote that if your chicken pieces are cold, they may cause the melted butter to thicken, leaving too much butter sticking the chicken pieces. If you see this happening, just reheat the butter.\n5 Place chicken on roasting dish: Place coated chicken pieces on to a 9x13 (or larger) roasting dish. Try to leave a little room between each piece. (You may need to use more than one roasting pan.) Drizzle with remaining garlic butter.\n6 Bake: Bake uncovered at 450\xc2\xb0F 15 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear.

b"Print\nHow to Poach Chicken, the Quick and Easy Way\nCook time: 15 minutesYield: 1-4 cooked chicken breasts\nOne 12-ounce (raw) chicken breast will give you roughly 2 cups shredded chicken.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 to 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts (roughly 12 ounces each)\n1 teaspoon salt\nOptional seasonings: smashed garlic, bay leaf, peppercorns, sliced ginger, sliced lemons or oranges, sliced onions or celery, fresh rosemary, fresh thyme\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Place the chicken in a single layer in the bottom of a pan. It's ok if the pieces overlap a little.\n2 Cover with an inch of water. Add the salt and any seasonings you'd like to use.\n3 Bring to a boil over medium-high heat. As the water comes to a boil, foam will start to collect on the surface. If you're planning to use the cooking liquid for something else, you can skim the foam off the surface. Otherwise, it's fine to just leave it.\n4 Cover and simmer for 8 to 15 minutes: Once boiling, reduce the heat to low and cover the pan. Cook for 8 minutes, then begin checking the chicken to see if it's done. Thin cutlets will cook in about 8 minutes; large chicken breasts will need up to 15 minutes.\nThe chicken is done when it registers 165F in the thickest part of the meat with an instant read thermometer. You can also cut into the chicken to see if it's cooked through. Continue cooking and checking the chicken every minute or so until the chicken is cooked.\n5 Cool briefly, then shred or slice: Remove the chicken from the broth and place on a plate or cutting board. When cool enough to handle, shred or slice the chicken, as needed. Use immediately, or cool completely and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Shredded or sliced chicken can also be frozen for up to 3 months.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nInstant Pot Chicken Adobo and Rice Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nWe don\'t recommend using chicken breasts for this recipe as they tend to become too dry.\nNancy prefers a 1:2 ratio of vinegar to soy sauce, but I like the tanginess of a 1:1 version, too. Tweak the quantities of the ingredients to suit your own tastes!\nThe sauce for this recipe is rich with rendered chicken fat. If you\'d prefer a less fatty sauce, you can either use a fat separator to use skim off the fat, or cook the dish with boneless skinless chicken thighs.\nThis recipe works best in a 6-quart pressure cooker. If you are using a larger pressure cooker, double the quantities of vinegar, soy sauce, and sugar or add 2/3 cup water then reduce the sauce after cooking.\nStovetop Instructions: Simmer the chicken in the sauce in a covered soup pot or Dutch oven for 40 minutes, until tender. Cook the rice in a separate pot.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 to 3 1/2 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken legs and thighs (or 1 1/2 to 2 pounds boneless skinless chicken thighs)\n1 medium yellow onion, sliced\n4 garlic cloves, chopped\n1/3 cup soy sauce (use low sodium soy sauce for less salt, or tamari for gluten-free)\n3 tablespoons white vinegar (or rice vinegar for a milder flavor)\n1 tablespoon brown sugar\n1 teaspoon black peppercorns\n3 dried bay leaves\n1 1/2 cups long grain white rice\n1 1/2 cups water\nThinly sliced green onions, to garnish the rice (optional)\n  Special equipment:\n6-quart pressure cooker (I use an Instant Pot)\nRaised steam rack\nWire strainer\nSmall stainless steel bowl\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Combine the chicken and sauce ingredients in the pressure cooker. Stir or use your hands to evenly coat the chicken pieces in the sauce.\nNestle a raised steam rack in with the chicken pieces, making sure all of its legs are touching the bottom of the pot.\n2 Rinse the rice: Rinse the rice in a wire mesh strainer, let it drain for a minute or so, then combine it with the 1 1/2 cups of water in a small (1 \xc2\xbd-quart) stainless steel mixing bowl.\nPlace the bowl of rice and water on top of the steam rack in the pot. It should just fit inside the pot, so it will not touch the lid when the pot is closed.\n3 Cook the chicken and rice. Place the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure the pressure regulator is set to the \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d position. If you are using an Instant Pot, select the \xe2\x80\x9cPoultry\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cManual\xe2\x80\x9d program, then adjust the time to 15 minutes. If your pressure cooker does not have a \xe2\x80\x9cPoultry\xe2\x80\x9d program, set it manually to \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Pressure\xe2\x80\x9d for 15 minutes. For stovetop pressure cookers, cook for 12 minutes at high pressure.\nIt will take about 20 minutes for your pressure cooker to come up to pressure, and then the actual cooking will begin. Total time from the time you seal the pressure cooker to the finished dish is about 45 minutes (including a 10-minute natural pressure release).\n4 Release the pressure: When the cooking program ends, let the pressure release naturally for at least 10 minutes, then perform a quick pressure release by moving the pressure release knob from \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cVenting.\xe2\x80\x9d\n5 Fluff the rice: Wearing a pair of heat-proof mitts, remove the bowl of rice and the steam rack from the pot. Fluff the rice with a fork.\n6 Check the temperature of the chicken: Use an instant read thermometer to take the temperature of a piece of chicken at its thickest part. It should read at least 165\xc2\xbaF.\nIf the chicken isn\'t 165\xc2\xbaF yet, reset the pressure cooker and select the "Poultry" or "Manual" setting for another minute or two. It will take much less time to come up to pressure the second time since the food is already hot.\n7 Finish the sauce and serve: Transfer the chicken to a serving dish.\nIf you\'d like, you can reduce the sauce to concentrate the flavor using your pressure cooker\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cSaut\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d setting for 15 minutes.\nStrain the sauce to catch the bay leaves, peppercorns, and any bones that might have fallen from the chicken. If you prefer a less fatty sauce, use a fat separator to separate the sauce and the fat, or wait for the fat to float to the top and then skim it off.\nDrizzle some of the sauce over the chicken and serve the rest alongside.\nHello!

Taste the soup at the end and add more salt if needed.\nThis recipe calls for a classic mirepoix of carrots, onions, and celery for the vegetable base, but you can make this recipe your own by adding different vegetables, like fennel or cubes of butternut squash.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 bone-in chicken breasts, skin removed (1 to 1 1/2 pounds)\n1 cup long-grain white rice, like basmati\n2 celery ribs, diced small\n2 medium carrots, peeled and diced small\n1 onion, diced small\n2 cloves garlic, peeled but left whole\n1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste (see Recipe Note)\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 quarts unsalted or low-sodium chicken stock\nJuice of 1/2 lemon (about 3 tablespoons)\nChopped fresh parsley, for serving\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Assemble the soup and bring to a simmer: Combine the chicken, white rice, celery, carrots, onions, garlic, salt, and pepper in a large pot. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil over high heat.\nOnce the soup is boiling, reduce the heat to keep the soup at a gentle simmer.\n2 Simmer for about 25 minutes: As the soup simmers, skim off any foam that collects on the surface with a spoon. Continue to simmer until the rice and vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes. Remove the soup from heat.\n3 Shred the chicken and make the garlic paste: Remove the chicken and garlic cloves using a slotted spoon or tongs. Transfer the chicken breasts to a bowl and shred with two forks. Discard the bones. Return the shredded chicken to the pot.\nSmash the garlic cloves into a paste against a cutting board using a fork or the flat of your knife. Stir the paste back into the soup.\n4 Season and serve: Stir the lemon juice into to the soup, and taste. The soup should taste rich, barely salty, and with just a hint of lemon.

b"Save It Print\nRestaurant-Style Poached Chicken Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 2\nThis recipe is designed for chicken breasts, but you can also do this with turkey breast, pork tenderloin or a meaty fish such as halibut.\nYou can double this recipe, but if you do, use a larger pot and double the amount of poaching water.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 skinless chicken breast (1/2 pound)\n2 Tbsp lemon juice\nA couple pinches of salt\nA couple pinches of a dried herb of your choice - tarragon, oregano, basil, rosemary, or thyme, or some other seasoning such as cumin or paprika\nPlastic wrap*\n*Use a good quality plastic wrap that can withstand some heat. Look for packaging that indicates you can use the plastic wrap in a microwave oven. If it can handle a microwave oven, it will hold up in boiling water.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Trim the fat and coat chicken pieces in lemon juice, salt, and herbs: Trim all the fat from the chicken breast and slice it lengthwise. In a small bowl mix the lemon juice, salt, and herbs.\nAdd the chicken pieces and coat all over with the lemon juice mixture.\nLet the chicken pieces sit in the lemon juice while you heat the water in the next step.\n  2 Bring a pot of water (2 1/2 quarts of water, 4 quart pot) to a high simmer.\n3 Roll up the chicken in plastic wrap: Roll out a long sheet of plastic wrap at least twice as long as the chicken breast slices. Place 1 chicken strip on the plastic wrap, in the middle. Roll up the chicken in the plastic wrap tightly.\n  Compress as much air out of the chicken as you can as you roll it. Once the chicken is rolled up, rotate it on your cutting board or counter several times to tighten the cylinder even more. Tie the loose ends of the plastic wrap together in a double knot. Repeat with the second chicken strip.\n  4 Poach the chicken in the hot water: Once the water has reached a high simmer, turn off the heat (keep the pot on the burner though) and drop the rolled-up chicken cylinders in the pot. Cover the pot and let the chicken steep for 15 minutes.\nThe chicken should be cooked through by then. (If for some reason the chicken is not cooked through, for example if you are using larger than called for breasts, or if you are using frozen chicken that hadn't quite defrosted before starting cooking, you can always put the chicken back in the poaching liquid for a few more minutes.)\n  5 To serve, snip off the tied ends of the plastic wrap, and unwrap. Note that there will be some juice inside the plastic wrap with the chicken, which has lots of flavor. So you might want to unwrap the chicken pieces over a bowl or something to catch the juice, which you can then pour over the chicken if you want. Or serve the chicken with a sauce of your choice.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"
b"Print\nChicken Florentine Pesto Pasta Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Serves 6-8\nWe've used fresh spinach in this recipe, but you could easily use frozen. Just defrost and drain.\nINGREDIENTS\n12 ounces dried short pasta (bowties, penne, gemelli, etc)\n4 chicken breast cutlets (1 to 1 1/2 pounds total)\nSalt\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 medium onion, chopped, about 1 cup\n3 garlic cloves, minced\n1/2 cup white wine or stock\n8-16 ounces of fresh spinach*, washed, long stems removed and chopped\nBlack pepper\n1/4 cup heavy whipping cream\n1/4 cup (or more) pesto\n*To wash spinach, fill up a clean sink basin with cold water and let the spinach soak in the water. Move it around a bit to loosen any dirt. Fresh spinach is usually pretty dirty, so you may need to do a couple of soakings. Remove the spinach and shake off excess water. Lay the spinach leaves down on a clean towel and pat dry.\nMETHOD\n1 Start cooking the pasta: Bring a large pot of salted water (add enough salt so that the water tastes salty) to a boil. Add the dried pasta and cook until al dente.\n2 Cook the chicken: While preparing the pasta, cook the chicken. Sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt, heat the olive oil in a saut\xc3\xa9 pan and brown the chicken breasts on both sides over medium-high heat. They don't need to be cooked all the way through, just browned. Remove the chicken from the pan and set aside.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions: Add the chopped onion to the pan and saut\xc3\xa9 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally. While the onions cook, slice the chicken into strips. Put any pieces that are cooked all the way through in one pile, and put the ones that still need a little cooking in another pile.\n4 Add garlic, then white wine or stock: When the onions are just beginning to brown, add the garlic and cook another minute. Add the white wine or stock and boil vigorously until the liquid is reduced by half.\n5 Add spinach, chicken: Add the spinach and the undercooked pieces of chicken to the pan. Using tongs, turn them over to coat them with the juices in the pan. Continue to cook, turning and stirring often, until the spinach is wilted and the chicken cooked through, about 2 minutes.\n6 Combine chicken, spinach, pesto, pasta, cream: Turn off the heat and add some black pepper, the pile of cooked chicken pieces and the pesto. Stir to combine. Drain the pasta put it in a large bowl. Add the cream to the saut\xc3\xa9 pan and stir well to combine. Add the contents of the pan to the bowl with the pasta and mix well. Serve at once.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nPrint"
b"Print\nChicken Milanese Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: 4 servings\nLook for Panko crumbs in the Asian foods section of your grocery store, though they are also sometimes near the other packaged breadcrumbs. You can also order online.\nServe with a simple tossed salad, like this Kale Caesar Salad\nINGREDIENTS\n4 large skinless boneless chicken breasts (1 1/2 pounds, 680 g)\n1 1/2 cups (190 g) all-purpose flour\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon ground pepper\n3 large eggs\n2 cups (144 g) Panko breadcrumbs\n8 tablespoons (120 ml) olive oil, or more if needed\n1 lemon, cut into wedges, for serving\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the chicken: Set aside any smaller breasts or cutlets that are 1/2-inch thick. Set larger breasts on a cutting board. Hold the top of the chicken steady with one hand and hold a sharp knife parallel to the table in the other hand, then butterfly the breast in half like opening a book (watch your fingers!). Cut all the way through to make two thin pieces.\nContinue with the remaining large breasts. Pat them dry with paper towels. Set them on a rimmed baking sheet.\n2 Pound the chicken: Set one of the chicken breast slices between 2 sheets of plastic wrap. Use a meat mallet or small heavy pan to pound the breast to flatten it \xe2\x80\x93 six or so good whacks should do it.  Continue with the remaining breasts, returning them to the baking sheet.\n2 Set up an assembly line for coating the chicken: In a pie pan or shallow bowl, place the flour, 1/2 teaspoon of the salt, and pepper. Stir thoroughly. In another pie pan or shallow bowl, beat the eggs with the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt. In a third pie pan or bowl, place the Panko.\nSet the pan of chicken on the counter. Set the flour next to it on the right. Set the egg to the right, then the Panko as the last thing in the row.\n3 Coat the chicken: With tongs, dip one slice of chicken in flour, making sure both sides are coated and shaking the excess into the bowl. Next, coat the chicken in egg and lift it up so the excess falls back into the bowl. Finally, transfer to the Panko and coat both sides.\nReturn the chicken to the baking sheet. Continue with the remaining breasts until they are all coated.\n3 Cook the chicken in batches: Heat the oven to 250F with a baking sheet on a middle rack. Set a heavy 12-inch skillet over medium-high heat.\nAdd enough of the olive to the pan to make a 1/4-inch layer (about 4 tablespoons). Heat until the oil shimmers and flows; when hot, a piece of Panko thrown in the oil should sizzle.\nAdd 3 pieces of chicken in a single layer and cook without moving for 4 minutes, or until the bottoms are golden. Turn and brown the other sides for another 4 minutes, or until the chicken is cooked through.\n4 Keep the chicken warm: Transfer the finished chicken to the oven so they stay warm while you cook the remaining breasts. Cook the remaining breasts, adding more oil to the pan as needed to keep it coated.\n5 To serve: Serve right away with lemon and a green salad.\nIf making ahead, let the cooked chicken cool completely on a parchment-lined baking sheet, then store in the fridge. If you're planning on reheating in a few hours, you can leave them on the baking sheet. Otherwise, layer them in an airtight container with parchment between the layers, and refrigerate for 1 to 3 days.\nTo reheat, let the chicken cutlets sit out for half an hour to lose their chill, then warm in a 400F oven for 8 to 10 minutes or until piping hot and crispy.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nSkillet Chicken with Cheesy Orzo and Zucchini Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nIf you want to trade in the zucchini for 2 cups of small broccoli florets or peas, both are good options.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 to 2 tablespoons olive oil, as needed\n2 pounds boneless, skinless chicken breasts (4 to 6 pieces)\n1 medium yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup chopped)\n1 1/2 cups dried orzo\n2 medium zucchini, cubed (about 2 cups cubed)\n2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n3 cups chicken broth\n1 cup half-and-half (or whole milk)\n1/2 cup grated cheddar\n1/2 cup grated fontina or Havarti\nMETHOD\n1 Sear the chicken: In a very large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat. Season the chicken on both sides with salt and pepper.\nSear the chicken for about 4 minutes on each side, or until browned but not cooked through. (It should still be just barely pink in the center, if you want to cut into one of the pieces to test.) Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.\n2 Cook the onions and add the orzo: Reduce the heat to medium and add the remaining tablespoon of olive oil if needed (if there is still about a tablespoon of oil left in the pan, skip it).\nAdd the onions and saut\xc3\xa9 for 2 minutes until they start to become tender. Add the orzo and stir for another minute to coat it with the oil and onions.\n3 Add the zucchini and stock, and simmer: Stir in the zucchini, thyme, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Add the chicken broth, raise the heat to medium-high and allow the liquid to come to a simmer, about 3 minutes, scraping up any browned bits from the bottom.\nStir in the half-and half and bring it to a simmer, about 2 minutes. Cover the pan, lower the heat and simmer gently for about 8 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the orzo is almost tender. Much of the liquid will be absorbed, but it should still be fairly runny at this point.\n4  Add the cheese and chicken: Sprinkle in the cheeses in batches, stirring after each addition until the cheese is all melted. Taste the orzo after all the cheese is added and add additional salt if needed.\nTuck the browned chicken into the top of orzo mixture, and drizzle over top any juices that accumulated from the chicken as it rested.\nCover the pan and simmer for another 3 to 5 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through (165\xc2\xb0F with a digital thermometer) and the orzo and zucchini are tender. The orzo mixture will have thickened slightly, but should still be quite saucy, like a very loose risotto.\n5 Serve immediately: Serve the chicken and orzo hot from the pan.\nHello!

Then turn them over and move them to the cool side of the grill. Cover and cook for a few minutes more, until the chicken is cooked through.\n(The easiest way to test for doneness is with your fingertips. See The Finger Test to Check the Doneness of Meat. Or use a meat thermometer, remove the meat from the grill when the internal temperature of the chicken breast reaches 165\xc2\xb0F.)\nTake care not to overcook, as chicken breasts can easily dry out.\nHello!

(If you don't have a grill pan or grill, use a cast iron skillet, and only season the chicken with salt.)\nRub some olive oil all over the chicken breasts. Grill the breasts for a few minutes on each side to get some nice char marks, then lower the temperature to low and leave on the grill until the breasts are just almost cooked through.\nThey'll cook a little longer in the saut\xc3\xa9 pan, so they can still be a little pink in the middle at this point.\nRemove from pan or grill, set aside for a minute, then thinly slice.\n4 Blanch broccoli florets: Once the chicken has cooked and the water is boiling, add the broccoli florets to the salted boiling water. Allow the water to come back to a boil, and once boiling again, let cook for about 1 minute.

Sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt and toss gently so all the pieces are salted evenly.\nRefrigerate for 30 minutes. As they sit, the salt will draw moisture from the cucumbers, which will collect in the bottom of the bowl.\n3 Make the dressing: Whisk together rice vinegar, soy, honey, ginger, minced garlic, and cilantro. Chill in the fridge while cucumbers are draining.\n4 Assemble the salad: Transfer the cucumbers to a serving bowl. Add the shredded chicken and dressing. Toss to combine and dress the salad. Taste and add an extra splash of vinegar or soy sauce if needed.\nDivide between serving plates and top with sesame seeds, dried chili, and more cilantro. Serve immediately.

While the grill is heating, prep the ingredients.\n2 Mix BBQ sauce with chicken: Mix the cooked chicken with the BBQ sauce and set aside.\n3 Make sour cream BBQ sauce: Mix the sour cream with BBQ sauce and set aside.\n4 Make foil boats: Take the sheets of aluminum foil and crimp the sides so that you have "boats".\n5 Assemble nachos: Arrange a layer of tortilla chips over the bottom of the foil. It\'s okay if some of the chips overlap, but all chips should have some exposure at the top. Sprinkle with most of the cheese (reserve some to go on top of the chicken).\nSprinkle the BBQ sauce coated cooked chopped chicken over the chips. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.\n6 Grill: Place nacho boats on pre-heated grill, cover and cook for 5 to 10 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the chips are lightly browned at the edges.\nIf your grill doesn\'t have a cover (as in a campfire), either make a large foil packet to put the nachos in, or tent the foil boats with another piece of foil. Some of the nachos prepared this way may not be as crispy, but they\'ll still be great.\n7 Serve: To serve, drizzle with sour cream BBQ sauce and sprinkle with extras such as chopped tomato, red onion, jalape\xc3\xb1o, and/or cilantro.\nHello!

Use it to spoon over rice or pasta, or for dipping tortilla chips.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 15-ounce can fire roasted tomatoes (or canned whole or crushed tomatoes if fire roasted are not available)\n1/4 cup chopped red onion\n1 clove garlic, chopped\n1/2 cup, packed, chopped fresh cilantro\n2 chipotle chili peppers in adobo, plus 1 teaspoon adobo sauce (less or more to taste)\n1 teaspoon lime juice\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 1/2 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or thighs), trimmed of excess fat, cut into 3-inch wide pieces\n4 ounces grated or sliced Monterey jack cheese\nServe with or over\nAvocados\nMore chopped cilantro\nSour cream\nCorn or flour tortillas\nRice\nPasta\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the salsa: Place tomatoes, onion, garlic, cilantro, chipotle peppers and adobo, lime juice and salt in a blender or food processor. Pulse a few times so there are no more large chunks of anything, but not so much so that the salsa is completely smooth.\n2 Spread salsa over chicken: Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Place the chicken pieces in a casserole dish, just large enough to fit them all in a single layer (about 8x10-inches).  Spread the chipotle salsa over the chicken pieces, turning the chicken pieces to coat them all over with the salsa.\n3 Bake, layer with cheese, bake again: Cover with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes (30 minutes for thighs). Remove the foil, and sprinkle or layer the cheese over the chicken. Bake uncovered for 10 minutes more.\nServe over rice, pasta, or with tortillas on the side, along with chopped avocado, more cilantro, crema fresca or sour cream.\nVariation: This is a bake-in-the-oven recipe. You could easily adapt the recipe to the stovetop this way:  sear the chicken pieces first in a little olive oil, remove the chicken, add the onions to the pan, cook them till soft, add the garlic and chiles, cook a little longer, add the tomatoes, lime juice, cilantro, and salt, then add the chicken, coat the chicken with the sauce, bring to a low simmer, cover, cook for 25 minutes, sprinkle with cheese, cover and cook for a few more minutes until the cheese is melted.\nHello!

The pot will default to its \xe2\x80\x9cKeep Warm\xe2\x80\x9d setting. You can serve the soup right away or leave it for up to 10 hours.\n6 Shred the chicken: Once the pressure has released, open the pot. Use tongs to transfer the cooked chicken to a cutting board. Use a pair of forks to shred the chicken, then add it back to the soup and stir to combine. Taste for seasoning, adding more salt if you like.\n7 Serve the soup: Ladle the soup into bowls. Top each bowl with shredded cheese, sliced avocado, and cilantro. Serve with wedges of lime and tortillas alongside.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.
