Add gnocchi and cook until they float, about 4-5 minutes. Remove gnocchi and reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water for the skillet.\n2 Cook the corn kernels: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the olive oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the corn kernels. Let kernels cook in the skillet for 4-5 minutes until they are brown and blistered. Don\xe2\x80\x99t stir them too much. Let them sit so they get some color.\n3 Add onions and garlic: Once the corn has blistered, add the sweet onions and garlic. Cook for a few minutes until the onions have softened and are translucent.\n4 Make the skillet sauce: Once the onions are soft, add the cooked gnocchi to the skillet and toss everything together. Turn the heat down to low and add 1/2 cup of the reserved gnocchi water, or 1/2 cup cream. Stir to combine ingredients, then let simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly. Taste and season with salt and pepper.\n5 Finish the dish: Right before serving, add the mozzarella balls to the skillet and garnish with fresh basil.\nLeftovers will keep well in the fridge for a few days. Reheat it in a skillet over low heat with a little water. If you freeze the dish, make sure to thaw and reheat it gently. A microwave will ruin the sauce and the gnocchi texture.\nHello!

One of my favorite brands is Bob\xe2\x80\x99s Red Mill.\nRecipe Tester Suggestion: Add an extra peach or two if you have them and want more juicy peaches in your crisp!\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the crisp topping:\n1/2 cup (66 grams) oat flour (See recipe note)\n1/2 cup (78 grams) all-purpose flour\n1/3 cup old-fashioned rolled oats\n1/4 cup light brown sugar\n1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt\n3/4 cups pecans, roughly chopped\n1/2 cup unsalted butter cut into small pieces, well chilled\nFor the peaches:\n2 pounds peaches, sliced 1/2-inch thick (about 6 medium, or 6 cups sliced)\n1/2 teaspoon ground ginger\n1/3 cup crystallized candied ginger, diced small\n1/4 cup granulated sugar\n2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon)\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, for the pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n2 Make the crisp topping: In a small bowl, combine the two flours with a fork\xe2\x80\x94sometimes oat flour clumps together more than all-purpose. Add the rolled oats, brown sugar, and sea salt. Add the pecans and stir to combine.\nFinally, rub the butter until topping is buttery and crumbly. It should clump together easily between your fingers.\n3 Prepare the peaches: In a medium bowl, combine the sliced peaches, ground ginger, crystalized ginger, and sugar, along with the lemon juice. Stir together gently with a spatula.\n4 Prepare the pan: Put the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter into the cast iron pan and place into the oven for about 5 minutes, just until the butter melts.\n5 Assemble the crisp: Remove the pan from the oven and add the peach-ginger combination, spreading it out evenly. Add little dabs of the crisp topping as evenly as you can across the top of the peaches.\n  6 Bake the crisp: Bake in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the top is golden brown.\n7 Cool and serve: This is going to be hard, but you need to wait at least an hour before you scoop into this. Otherwise the juices will run everywhere, and you may burn your mouth.\nOnce it\xe2\x80\x99s made, this keeps best covered, in the refrigerator, for 3 to 4 days. Simply reheat it in a low oven for about 10 minutes.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

b'Print\nSlow Cooker Chickpea Curry with Sweet Potatoes and Red Peppers Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 8 hoursYield: 8 to 10 servings\nI prefer white-fleshed sweet potatoes for this recipe because they\'re starchier and hold up better to longer cooking. If you use orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, they will break down a little more and make a thicker, creamier sauce, which is also good!\nTo reduce cooking time, soak the chickpeas overnight, skip the extra water, and cook on high for 4 to 6 hours.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1 medium yellow onion, diced\n1 pound dried chickpeas, rinsed\n2 tablespoons curry powder\n1 large white-fleshed sweet potato, peeled and diced (See Recipe Note)\n1 large or two small sweet bell peppers, diced (red or yellow, about 1/2 pound)\n1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes\n1 (15.5 ounce) can coconut milk\n1 1/4 cups water\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1 diced serrano, jalape\xc3\xb1o, or fresno chili (optional)\n1 teaspoon salt\n6 cups spinach, roughly chopped, to serve\nCooked rice, to serve (optional)\nChopped cilantro, to serve\nLime or lemon wedges, to serve\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart or larger slow cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Combine the ingredients in the slow cooker: Drizzle olive oil in the bottom of a 6-quart or larger slow cooker then add onion and stir to coat. Pour dried chickpeas on top, then sprinkle the curry powder evenly over the beans.\nFollow with sweet potato, bell pepper, tomatoes, coconut milk, water, garlic, chili pepper (if using), and salt. Do not stir (leaving the chickpeas on the bottom and the sweet potatoes on top helps everything cook more evenly).\n2 Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours: If you\'re around, stir the curry after about 4 hours and give it a check. At this point, the curry should seem soupy and the chickpeas will likely be edible, but still crunchy. If the slow cooker seems dry, add another half cup of water. (The curry will also be fine if you\'re not around to stir it.)\nTotal cooking time will depend on your slow cooker and your chickpeas. The curry can be served any time after the chickpeas are soft and tender.\nIt\'s also fine to if the curry cooks a little longer, or if you leave it on the "warm" setting for a while. The recipe is very forgiving! The curry will get thicker and creamier the longer it cooks.\n3 Serve with spinach: Stir the curry well. Taste and add additional salt if needed. Serve the curry over bowls of chopped spinach, stirring to wilt the spinach. (You can also stir the spinach directly into the curry if that\'s more convenient for you.)\nGarnish with cilantro and a squeeze of lemon or lime.\nLeftovers will keep for about a week or can be frozen for up to three months.\nHello!

The Yukon golds will result in a creamier soup.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 large leeks (about 3 cups, chopped)\n2 tablespoons butter\n4 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth for vegetarian option)\n2 pounds potatoes (Yukon gold or Russet), peeled, diced into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 teaspoon sea salt, less or more to taste\nPinch of dried marjoram\n1 or 2 sprigs fresh thyme, or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme\n1 bay leaf\n1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley\nSprinkle of Tabasco sauce or other red chili sauce\nWhite or black pepper to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Clean and cut the leeks: Cut off the roots of the leeks. Cut the leeks lengthwise, fan them open under running water to dislodge any dirt or mud hiding inside. Cut off the tough dark green tops and discard (either compost or freeze for making stock).\nSlice the white and light green parts of the leeks crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices. Place the slices in a bowl of cold water and agitate them with your hands to dislodge any remaining dirt. Then scoop out the leeks with a sieve or slotted spoon. (See How to Clean Leeks)\n2 Cook leeks in butter to soften: Melt butter on medium heat in a 3 to 4 quart thick-bottomed pot. Add the chopped leeks, stir to coat with the butter.\nCover the pot and reduce the heat to low, cook for 10 minutes until the leeks are softened. Check to make sure the leeks are not browning.\n3 Simmer the soup: Add the broth, diced potatoes, bay leaf, marjoram, thyme, and a teaspoon of salt to the pot.\nIncrease the heat to high to bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer, and cook for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked through.\n4 Pur\xc3\xa9e the soup: Remove and discard the bay leaf and thyme sprig. Use an immersion blender or standing blender to blend about half of the soup if you want a chunky soup, or all of it if you would like your soup to be more smooth.\nNote: if you're using a standing blender, pur\xc3\xa9e the soup in batches, don't fill the blender more than a third full at a time, and remember to hold down the lid while the blender is going.\n5 Season the soup: Add the parsley, and cook a few minutes more. Add a few dashes of Tabasco to taste.\nAdd freshly ground pepper and more salt to taste. (Potatoes soak up salt, so you may need to add more salt than you expect.)\nHello!

Freshly made rice will make a fried rice that's mushy.\nINGREDIENTS\n8 ounces small raw shrimp, shelled and deveined\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\nfreshly ground black pepper\n1/2 teaspoon cornstarch\n3 tablespoons peanut oil, canola oil, or rice bran oil\n3 eggs, beaten\n2 stalks green onion, minced\n4 cups leftover rice, grains separated well\n3/4 cup frozen peas and carrots, defrosted\n1 tablespoon soy sauce (use gluten-free soy sauce if you are making a gluten-free version), plus more to taste\n1 teaspoon dark toasted sesame oil\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toss shrimp with salt, pepper, cornstarch: In a medium bowl, sprinkle the shrimp with salt, pepper, and cornstarch, and toss to coat. Set aside to sit for ten minutes at room temperature.\n2 Heat pan on high heat: Heat a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan or wok (a seasoned cast iron pan or hard anodized aluminum works well, they're relatively stick free and can take the heat) on high heat.\nWhen the pan is very hot (a drop of water instantly sizzles when it hits the pan), swirl in one tablespoon of the cooking oil to coat the pan.\n3 Sear shrimp on both sides: Add the shrimp to the hot pan, spreading them out quickly in a single layer. Let them fry in the pan without moving them, for 30 seconds.\nFlip the shrimp over and let them fry on the other side for another 30 seconds or until they are mostly cooked through. (Do not cook them all the way!)\nUse a slotted spoon to scoop the shrimp out of the pan to a bowl.\n4 Cook beaten eggs, slightly runny: Return the pan to the burner and lower the heat to medium. Add a little more oil if the pan needs it. Add the beaten eggs and stir them quickly to scramble them while they cook.\nWhen the eggs are not quite cooked through, still a bit runny, transfer them from the pan to the bowl with the cooked shrimp.\n5 Saut\xc3\xa9 green onions, add rice: Clean out the pan or wok with paper towels and return it to the burner. Heat the pan on high and when it is hot, swirl in the remaining tablespoon or two of oil. When the oil is shimmering hot (almost smoking), add the green onions and saut\xc3\xa9 for 15 seconds.\nThen add the leftover cooked rice to the pan and stir with the green onions to mix well.\nSpread the rice onion mixture over the surface of the pan and let it fry, without moving it. You should hear the rice sizzle. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes.\nUse a spatula to turn over the rice, and spread it over the pan again. Let cook for a minute longer.\n6 Add soy sauce, carrots, peas, shrimp, eggs, sesame oil: Sprinkle soy sauce on the rice and stir to combine.\nAdd the carrots, peas, shrimp, eggs, and sesame oil, stirring to combine well.\nHeat everything until sizzling hot.

The cuts should be at an angle, in the direction of the grain of the meat as the knife tip is going in. The cuts should be about an inch apart from each other.\nTurn the steak over and repeat the cuts on the other side. Make sure that the cuts you are making on this side are parallel with the cuts you made on the other side, otherwise you may cut across an existing cut, and end up poking a hole through the meat.\n2 Rub with salt, pepper, dry mustard, and butter: Sprinkle one side of the steak with salt and freshly ground pepper. Sprinkle the steak with dry mustard. (You can use regular mustard if you don't have any dry mustard.)\nRub a tablespoon of butter all over the side of the steak. Turn the steak over and repeat with the dry mustard, pepper, and butter.\n3 Sear steak in hot frying pan: Heat a large cast iron frying pan on high heat. Place steak in hot pan. Let sear for 2 to 3 minutes until well browned.\nUse tongs to lift up to see if nicely browned. If so, flip to the other side and let sear for 2 to 3 minutes.\n4 Remove from heat: Remove the pan from the heat and let the steak continue to cook for 5 to 10 minutes in the residual heat of the pan (assuming you are using cast iron, if not, lower the heat to low).\n5 Check for doneness: Use your fingertips to check for doneness or insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak - 120\xc2\xb0F for very rare, 125\xc2\xb0F for rare, or 130\xc2\xb0F for medium rare. Flank steak should be served rare or medium rare, otherwise it may be too dry.\nIf the steak isn't done enough to your liking, return the steak and pan to medium high heat for a few minutes.\n6 Let the steak rest: Remove the steak from the pan to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes, covered with aluminum foil.\n7 Thinly slice: Cut the meat in very thin slices, at an angle, across the grain of the meat. (This way you break through the tough long muscle fibers.)\n8 Boil juices, deglaze pan, add butter to make sauce: Any juices that come out of the meat while cutting or resting, return to the pan. Return the pan to a burner on high heat and deglaze the pan with a little water, scraping up any browned bits. Once the water has mostly boiled down, add a little butter to the pan for a nice sauce.\nArrange the cut meat on a serving plate and pour the deglazed pan juices over the meat.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nNew England Boiled Dinner Recipe\nCook time: 4 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nCorned beef can be pretty salty, so if you are making boiled dinner with corned beef you may want to put it in a pot, cover with cold water, bring to a boil, and then discard the water before starting the recipe. If the broth ends up being too salty, you can serve just the meat and vegetables, without the broth, or add water to the broth to dilute it.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 1/2 pounds corned beef brisket or plain beef brisket\n15 peppercorns\n8 whole cloves\n1 bay leaf\nSalt, if using plain brisket\n2 medium sized turnips, peeled and quartered\n4 red new potatoes, peeled and quartered\n3 large carrots, cut into thirds and the thickest pieces quartered lengthwise\n1 small head cabbage, cut into fourths\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Put corned beef in a pot, cover with water, add seasonings, simmer: Put the brisket in a 5 or 6 quart Dutch oven and cover with an inch of water.\nIf you are using corned beef brisket and it does not come already packed in seasoning, add peppercorns, cloves, and a bay leaf to the pot.\nIf using plain brisket, add a teaspoon of salt for every quart of water.\nBring to a simmer and then cover, lower the heat until it is barely simmering. Keep at a low simmer for four hours or until the meat is tender (a fork goes through easily).\n2 Remove meat, add vegetables, simmer: Remove the meat and set aside, keeping the meat warm. Add the vegetables to the pot. Check the broth for taste. If it is too salty, add a little more water to taste.\nRaise the temperature and bring the soup to a high simmer. Cook at a high simmer until done, about 15-30 minutes longer, depending on the size of the cut of your vegetables.\n\n3 Slice meat across the grain: Slice the meat in thin slices across the grain. You may find it easier to slice if you first cut the roast in half along the same direction as the grain of the meat. Then slice smaller lengths across the grain.\n\nServe in bowls, a few pieces of meat in each, add some of the vegetables and some broth. Serve with horseradish or mustard or both.\nHello!

Slice first in half, and then slice off sections a half inch wide at widest point.\n2-3 bell peppers of various colors, stemmed, seeded, de-ribbed, sliced lengthwise into strips\nSalt\nSTEAK FAJITA MARINADE:\nJuice of 1 lime\n2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, peeled, minced\n1/2 teaspoon ground cumin\n1/2 fresh jalape\xc3\xb1o pepper, seeded, ribs removed, finely chopped (be careful not to touch your eyes or anywhere near your eyes after handling a jalape\xc3\xb1o pepper!)\n1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, including stems\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Marinate the steak: Mix all marinade ingredients. Coat the steak with the marinade and let it sit at room temperature for an hour, or longer in the fridge.\nBefore you cook the meat, wipe off most of the marinade and sprinkle the steak with salt.\n2 Sear the steak on both sides: Set a large cast iron pan or griddle over high heat and let this heat up for 1-2 minutes. Add the tablespoon of oil to the pan and let this heat up for 1 minute.\nAdd the steak, frying on each side for 3 minutes, or to desired doneness. 3 minutes per side will yield approximately medium rare doneness for an average cut of flank steak.\nCarne asada and skirt steak will need less time. If the pan starts to smoke too much, reduce the heat to medium-high. You want the steak browned, not burned.\nRemove from pan and let sit, tented with foil, for 5 minutes.\n3 Cook the vegetables while the meat is resting. Add a little more oil to the pan if necessary, then add the onions and bell peppers.\nLet these sear for 1 minute before stirring, then stir every 90 seconds or so as the veggies sear. Cook for 5-6 minutes total.\n4 Slice the meat across the grain into thin slices. If you slice the meat at an angle, you will be able to get your slices pretty thin. These cuts of steak are flavorful but can be a little tough, so thin slices will really help make it easier to eat.\n5 Serve immediately with shredded cheese, salsa, shredded iceberg lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and warm flour tortillas. (Hint for warming tortillas - put in microwave over a paper towel for 20 seconds on high heat.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nBeef Brisket Pot Roast Recipe\nPrep time: 35 minutesCook time: 4 hours, 15 minutesYield: Serves 8-12\nINGREDIENTS\n4 to 5 pound (about 2 kg) beef brisket, flat cut or point cut\nSalt\n1 to 2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n3 large onions, sliced\n5 to 6 garlic cloves, minced\n1 sprig thyme\n1 sprig rosemary\n3 to 4 bay leaves\n2 cups beef stock\n2 to 3 large carrots, peeled and cut into 1 1/2-inch pieces\n1 tablespoon mustard (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the brisket: On one side of the brisket there should be a layer of fat, which you want. If there are any large chunks of fat, cut them off and discard them. Large pieces of fat will not be able to render out completely.\nUsing a sharp knife, score the fat in parallel lines, about 3/4-inch apart. Slice through the fat, not the beef. Repeat in the opposite direction to make a cross-hatch pattern.\nSalt the brisket well and let it sit at room temperature for 30 minutes.\n2 Sear the brisket: You\'ll need an ovenproof, thick-bottomed pot with a cover, or Dutch oven, that is just wide enough to hold the brisket roast with a little room for the onions.\nPat the brisket dry and place it, fatty side down, into the pot and place it on medium high heat. Cook for 5 to 8 minutes, lightly sizzling, until the fat side is nicely browned. (If the roast seems to be cooking too fast, turn the heat down to medium. You want a steady sizzle, not a raging sear.)\nTurn the brisket over and cook for a few minutes more to brown the other side.\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions and garlic: When the brisket has browned, remove it from the pot and set aside. There should be a couple tablespoons of fat rendered in the pot. If not, add some olive oil.\nAdd the chopped onions and increase the heat to high. Sprinkle a little salt on the onions. Saut\xc3\xa9, stirring often, until the onions are lightly browned, 5 to 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and cook 1 to 2 more minutes.\n4 Simmer the brisket and roast it: Preheat the oven to 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C). Use kitchen twine to tie together the bay leaves, rosemary and thyme.\nMove the onions and garlic to the sides of the pot and nestle the brisket inside. Add the beef stock and the tied-up herbs. Bring the stock to a boil on the stovetop. Cover the pot, then place in the 300\xc2\xb0F (150\xc2\xb0C) oven. Cook for 3 hours. Carefully flip the brisket every hour so it cooks evenly.\n5 Add carrots, continue to cook: After 3 hours, add the carrots. Cover the pot and cook for 1 hour more, or until the carrots are cooked through and the brisket is falling-apart tender.\n6 Remove brisket: When the brisket is falling-apart tender, take the pot out of the oven and remove the brisket to a cutting board. Cover it with foil. Pull out and discard the herbs.\n7 Make sauce (optional): At this point you have two options. You can serve as is, or you can make a sauce with the drippings and some of the onions. If you serve as is, skip this step.\nTo make a sauce, remove the carrots and half of the onions, set aside and cover them with foil. Pour the ingredients that are remaining into a blender, and pur\xc3\xa9e until smooth. If you want, add 1 tablespoon of mustard to the mix. Put into a small pot and keep warm.\n8 Slice and serve: Notice the lines of the muscle fibers of the roast. This is the "grain" of the meat. Slice the meat perpendicular to these lines, or across the grain (cutting this way further tenderizes the meat), in 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices. (A sturdy bread knife works great for slicing roasts.)\nServe with the onions, carrots and gravy. Serve with mashed, roasted or boiled potatoes, egg noodles, or polenta.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nSweet and Sour Chicken Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound of boneless and skinless chicken thighs or breasts, cut into 1" chunks\n1 egg white\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (1/4 teaspoon table salt)\n2 teaspoons cornstarch\n1 10-ounce can pineapple chunks (reserve juice)\n1/4 cup juice from the canned pineapple\n1/4 cup white vinegar\n1/4 cup ketchup\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt (1/4 teaspoon table salt)\n2-3 tablespoons brown sugar\n1 tablespoon + 1 teaspoon cooking oil\n1 red bell pepper, cut into 1 inch chunks\n1 yellow bell pepper, cut into 1 inch chunks\n1 teaspoon grated fresh ginger\nMETHOD\n1 Coat chicken with egg white, salt, and cornstarch: In a bowl, combine the chicken with the egg white, salt and cornstarch. Stir to coat the chicken evenly. Let sit for 15 minutes at room temperature or up to overnight in the refrigerator.\n2 Make sweet sour sauce: Whisk together the pineapple juice, vinegar, ketchup, salt, and brown sugar.\n3 Stir-fry chicken: Heat a large frying pan or wok over high heat until a bead of water instantly sizzles and evaporates. Pour in the 1 tablespoon of cooking oil and swirl to coat. It\'s important that the pan is very hot.\nAdd the chicken and spread the chicken out in one layer. Let the chicken fry, untouched for 1 minute, until the bottoms are browned.\nFlip and fry the other side the same for 1 minute. The chicken should still be pinkish in the middle. Dish out the chicken onto a clean plate, leaving as much oil in the pan as possible.\n4 Stir fry bell pepper and ginger: Turn the heat to medium and add the remaining 1 teaspoon of cooking oil. Let the oil heat up and then add the bell pepper chunks and ginger. Fry for 1 minute.\n5 Add pineapple, sweet sour sauce, let simmer, add chicken: Add the pineapple chunks and the sweet and sour sauce. Turn the heat to high and when the sauce is simmering, add the chicken pieces back in.\nLet simmer for 1-2 minutes, until the chicken is cooked through. Timing depends on how thick you\'ve cut your chicken. The best way to tell if the chicken is done is to take a piece out and cut into it. If it\'s pink, add another minute to the cooking.\nTaste the sauce and add more brown sugar if you\xe2\x80\x99d like.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nBroccoli Cheddar Soup Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nINGREDIENTS\n1 large head or two small heads broccoli (a little more than 1 pound), chopped into florets and stems\n1/4 cup unsalted butter\n1/2 white onion, chopped\n1 small carrot, peeled and grated\n1/4 cup all-purpose flour\n1 quart vegetable stock\n2 cups whole milk\n8 ounces cheddar cheese, grated\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/8 teaspoon fresh black pepper\nBread, for serving\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Blanch the broccoli: Bring a large pot of water to a boil and add a few big pinches of salt. Add broccoli stalks and blanch for 2 to 3 minutes until they are bright green and fork tender, but still slightly crispy.\nDrain broccoli. Scoop out and set aside about 1 cup of the florets for the topping.\n2 Cook the onions and carrots: Wipe out the pot, place over medium heat, and melt the butter. Once melted, add the onions and carrots, and cook until veggies soften, 4 to 5 minutes, stirring regularly.\n3 Cook the soup: Stir in the all-purpose flour. The flour will form a paste with the veggies. Cook for a minute or two to coat the vegetables, and then start to slowly pour in vegetable stock. Stir constantly as you pour in the stock to avoid lumps.\nOnce all the stock is added, bring soup up to a low simmer. Add milk and the blanched broccoli (except what you're saving for the topping). Simmer for about 10 minutes over low heat.\n4 Puree the soup: Blend with an immersion blender, or let the soup cool until no longer steaming and blend in batches in a blender. (If using a blender, be careful to let the soup cool a bit and do not overfill the blender to avoid splattered hot soup!)\n5 Season to taste and serve: Add the grated cheese, salt, and pepper to the pureed soup and stir over low heat until the cheese has melted. Taste soup and season with additional salt and pepper to your liking.\nLadle the soup into bowls and garnish with some reserved broccoli and extra cheese on top. Serve with bread.\nHello!

b'Print\nVegan Stuffed Squash with Brown Rice and Mushrooms Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 6\nThe vegetables and rice for the filling and the roasted squash halves can be prepped a day or two ahead. Warm them on the stovetop or in the microwave before continuing with the recipe.\nNote that one of the squashes is pureed and mixed into the filling. The remaining squash halves will be stuffed and served.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the squash:\n4 small winter squash (about 1 1/2 pounds each), like kabocha, acorn squash, or pie pumpkins\n1/2 tablespoon olive oil\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon pepper\nFor the filling:\n4 tablespoons olive oil, divided\n2 cups brown rice\n4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth or water\n1 cup diced carrot\n1 cup diced shallots\n1 cup diced celery\n1 1/4 pounds mushrooms, diced (I used a mix of creminis and wild mushrooms),\n3 cloves garlic, minced\n1/2 cup white wine\nPinch cinnamon\n1 cup chopped mixed herbs (parsley, chives, and chervil work beautifully here)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the oven to 400F and prepare the squash. Cut the squash in half and scrape out the seeds. Cut a small sliver from the bottom of each squash half to create a stable surface for the "bowl." Rub the squash halves inside and out with olive oil, then sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.\n2 Roast the squash: Roast the squash halves cut-side down for 30 minutes, then flip them over and roast cut-side up (like a bowl) for another 15 minutes. When done, the squash should be easily pierced with a fork and toasted golden-brown on the surface. (About 45 minutes total; if the squash finishes roasting before the filling is ready, turn the oven heat to its lowest temperature and keep them warm until needed.)\n3 While the squash roasts, begin preparing the rice stuffing: In a large pot over medium heat, toast the rice with 1 tablespoon of olive oil until the rice smells fragrant and nutty, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir frequently to avoid burning.\n4 Cook the rice: Pour the vegetable broth or water over the rice and give it a quick stir. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once the water reaches boiling, turn down heat to low, cover the pot, and cook for 25 to 30 minutes until the rice is tender. If the rice isn\xe2\x80\x99t done, continue checking every five minutes.\n5 Cook the carrots, shallots, and celery: Warm 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Saut\xc3\xa9 the carrot, shallot, and celery until the shallots become translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer the veggies to a large bowl, and set aside.\n6 Cook the mushrooms in batches: In the same 12-inch skillet, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and turn the heat to medium-high. Add a third of the mushrooms \xe2\x80\x93 do not to overcrowd the pan. Sprinkle 1/8 teaspoon salt and a little pepper over the mushrooms, but do not stir.\nLet the mushrooms cook without stirring for 2 to 3 minutes, until a caramelized crust forms on the bottom of the mushrooms. (Lift one up to check!) Once you see a brown crust, stir the mushrooms together. Continue cooking, stirring often, until the mushrooms have released all their liquid and look evenly browned on all sides.\nRepeat with the remaining mushrooms, adding more oil to the pan as needed.\n7 Finish the vegetables: When all the mushrooms are cooked, return the cooked mushrooms, carrots, shallots, and celery to the pan over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add the white wine and scrape any glazed bits from the bottom of the pan as the wine simmers. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, until most of the wine has evaporated. Remove from heat.\n(If the vegetables and rice are ready before the roasted squash, cover the pans to keep warm until needed. If necessary, re-warm briefly on the stovetop or the microwave before continuing with the recipe.)\n8 Set 6 of the roasted squash halves on plates for serving; scoop the flesh from the remaining 2 squash halves. Transfer the flesh to a food processor. Add the cinnamon and puree until very smooth.\n9 Finish the squash filling: In a large bowl, combine the mushrooms, vegetables, cooked rice, and squash puree and mix until well-combined. Taste and add more salt, pepper, or cinnamon if you like. Finally, stir in fresh herbs, reserving some herbs for sprinkling over top.\n10 Stuff the squashes and serve: Divide the filling equally between all the squash halves, mounding the filling slightly. Sprinkle with chopped herbs and serve immediately while piping hot.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nRoasted Winter Squash with Cilantro Chimichurri Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 6 to 8 servings\nI typically use acorn or delicata squash for this recipe since they don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be peeled and are easily prepped, though feel free to use any other hearty winter squash like butternut, pumpkin, or kuri. The chimichurri sauce is also great on roasted potatoes, carrots, and sweet potatoes.\nUrfa biber is a dark maroon chili flake common in Turkish cuisine. A super adulty spice. The chilies are sun-cured during the day and sweated at night before being ground with a touch of salt. The result is a smoky-salty-sweet-savory chili flake whose complex flavor is reminiscent of chocolate, raisins, and inky red wine. The heat is mild, but builds the more you eat, yet never overwhelms. It\xe2\x80\x99s one of those rare ingredients that really can go on nearly everything. I actually keep it in a small container on the kitchen table for this reason and recommend you do so as well.\nYou can find urfa biber pretty easily online at stores like Spice Jungle or Olive Nation. However, if you don\xe2\x80\x99t have urfa biber chili flakes, then feel free to use regular chili flakes. I have done this plenty of times and the recipe is equally awesome.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the squash:\n3 pounds acorn or delicata squash\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1/4 teaspoon salt\nGround black pepper\nFor the cilantro chimichurri:\n1/2 cup olive oil\n1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro\n1/2 cup finely chopped parsley\n1 tablespoon finely chopped oregano leaves\n1 1/2 teaspoons urfa biber, or regular chili flakes\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n4 garlic cloves, minced\n1/4 cup red wine vinegar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 375F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, a silicon baking mat, or parchment paper.\n2 Prepare the squash: Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out and discard the strings and seeds (save and roast the seeds, if you like). Cut the squash into 1-inch slices.\nToss the squash with a 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon or so of salt, and ground black pepper. Place on the prepared baking sheet.\n3 Roast the squash for 30 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork.\n4 While the squash is cooking prepare the chimichurri. In a medium bowl, stir together the olive oil, cilantro, parsley, oregano leaves, chili flakes, garlic, red wine vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Taste and add more salt if needed.\n5 Serve: Transfer the roasted squash to a serving platter or individual plates, top with a generous amount of chimichurri, and enjoy.\nHello!

With the cut sides down, place the squash on the baking sheet. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife. Remove and cool briefly.\n3 While the squash roasts, cook the rice: In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups water and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil. Add the rice and adjust the heat to a simmer. Set a lid on top, slightly askew, and cook for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the rice \xe2\x80\x9cgrains\xe2\x80\x9d are tender (some grains may begin to separate or burst). Drain in a sieve or fine-mesh colander.\n4 Cook the turkey and vegetables: In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the turkey and break it up into tablespoon-sized clumps using a stiff spatula or wooden spoon. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring often to further break up the meat, until it begins to brown.\nAdd the shallot, celery, apple, sage, rosemary, cranberries, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Cook and stir for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables soften.\nIf the pan seems dry, add up to 1/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and stir to scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the skillet until the water evaporates. Stir in the cooked rice. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if you like.\n5 Stuff the squash: Turn the squash on the baking sheet so the cut side is up. Divide the filling between the halves.\n6 Bake the squash: In a small bowl, mix the breadcrumbs with 1 teaspoon of oil. Sprinkle on top of the squash halves.\nBake for 10 minutes, or until hot all the way through and the breadcrumbs are browned.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nRed Chile Marinated Grilled Chicken Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hourMarinating time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4-6\nMaking the sauce from scratch, our chicken ended up quite spicy hot, almost like jerk chicken. Using canned sauce as a base, even one with medium heat, most of the heat was lost in the cooking process. If you like your chicken spicy hot, and you are using a canned sauce, I recommend starting with one that is graded "hot".\nINGREDIENTS\n3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts, preferably thighs, trimmed of excess skin and fat\nSalt\n1 1/4 cup Mexican red chili sauce, either homemade* or canned (if you are gluten intolerant and are using canned chili sauce, make sure to read the ingredients on the can, some makers put wheat products in their sauce)\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n2 tablespoons white or cider vinegar\n1/2 teaspoon ground cloves\n1/2 teaspoon ground allspice\n1 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon ground cumin\nA couple of turns on a black pepper grinder\nA pinch of dried oregano, crushed\n1 teaspoon minced garlic\nGarnish\nAvocado slices\nThinly sliced lettuce or cabbage\nThinly sliced radishes\nCilantro\n* To make your own homemade sauce, take 2 ancho and 2 guajillo chiles, open them up, remove the stems, seeds, and ribs. Lightly toast the chiles on a medium griddle or cast iron pan for a minute or two, flattening them down with a metal spatula. Place the chiles in a saucepan, cover with water, bring to a boil, remove from heat and let soak for 10-15 minutes, until chiles are softened. Place chiles, 1 1/4 cup of the soaking water, 1 clove of garlic, a pinch of salt, in a blender. Blend until completely smooth. Put mixture through a strainer to strain out any solids. Proceed with the recipe, but don\'t add any more garlic to the sauce.\nMETHOD\n1 Simmer chili sauce and spices to make the marinade: Heat oil in a medium sized saucepan on medium heat. Add the chili sauce. Add vinegar (2 Tbsp if using canned sauce, 4 Tbsp in you\'ve made your own sauce), cloves, allspice, cinnamon, cumin, black pepper, oregano and garlic.\nBring to a simmer and let simmer for 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let cool.\n2 Marinate chicken: Sprinkle salt over all the chicken pieces on all sides. Put chicken pieces in a non-reactive bowl or a large freezer bag. Add the marinade, make sure all pieces are coated well with the marinade.\nMarinate in the refrigerator at least one hour, preferably overnight.\n3 Grilling Instructions: Remove the chicken from the refrigerator before starting up the grill. Preheat your grill, allowing for a space on the grill for cooking the chicken with indirect heat. (If using coals, move all the coals to one side of the grill, if using gas, after the grill is hot, turn off one of the burners.)\nBrush the grill grates with olive oil. Make sure the chicken pieces are well coated on all sides with the paste-like marinade.\nPlace the chicken pieces on the indirect heat part of the grill (not over a flame or coals). Cook, covered, for 25-30 minutes, turning the pieces over after the first 15 minutes. Try to keep the temperature in the grill around 350\xc2\xb0F. Chicken is done when juices run clear, breasts have an internal temperature of 165\xc2\xb0F and thighs 175\xc2\xb0F.\n3a Roasting Instructions: If you aren\'t in a grilling mood, you can roast the chicken pieces in the oven. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Place the chicken pieces in a roasting pan, skin-side up. Cook for about 45-50 minutes, until breasts have an internal temperature of 165\xc2\xb0F and thighs 175\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Serve with garnishes: Serve garnished with sliced avocado, sliced lettuce or cabbage dressed with a little vinegar and oil, sliced radishes and cilantro.\nMakes for great leftover chicken to cut up and put into tacos.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nMexican Red Chili Sauce Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Makes a little more than 1 cup\nINGREDIENTS\n3 dried Ancho (sometimes called pasilla in the US*) chiles OR 2 Ancho and 2 Guajillo chiles\nWater\n1 large clove garlic\n2 black peppercorns, crushed\nA pinch of ground cloves\n1/2 teaspoon of salt, more to taste\nExtra virgin olive oil\n* According to Diana Kennedy, Pasilla chilies are a long and skinny variety of chile, while Ancho chilies (dried poblanos) are shorter and wider. However, in certain parts of Michoacan, Mexico, the Ancho chile is called Pasilla, and because of immigration, is commonly known as Pasilla in many parts of the US.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cut the chiles open and remove stem and seeds: Working on one chile at a time, use a paring knife to cut a slit all the way down one side of a chile. Open up the chile and remove the stem and seeds. Remove as much of the veins as you can.\nReserve a few of the seeds or veins for adding later if you want added heat.\nNote when working with chilies, either wear protective gloves or wash your hands very thoroughly with soap and warm water after handling the chilies. Do not touch or rub your eyes if you have been handling chili peppers.\n2 Heat the chiles on a skillet: Heat a large skillet on medium heat. Flatten out the dried chilies as well as you can and place on the skillet to heat.\nPress down on the opened chilies and leave for a few seconds. Turn the chilies over and heat a few seconds more.\nYou do not want to toast or burn the chilies! If they burn, they'll turn bitter. Just heat them enough to draw out more of their flavor.\n3 Soften the chiles in hot water: Add the chilies to a small saucepan and add enough water so that they are just covered. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes, until the chilies have softened and plumped up.\n(OR pour place the chilies in a small saucepan and pour boiling water over them to cover. Let sit for 15 minutes, until softened.)\n4 Pur\xc3\xa9e with garlic, seasonings, water or poaching liquid: Reserving the soaking water, remove the chilies from the pan and place in a blender. Add the garlic, salt, crushed peppercorns, ground cloves, and 1 1/2 cups of the soaking liquid (taste the soaking water first, if it seems bitter, use plain water instead).\nPur\xc3\xa9e for 2 minutes, until the sauce is completely smooth. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning. If you want more heat, add in a few of the seeds or veins and pur\xc3\xa9e some more. Add more salt if needed.\n5 Strain through sieve into a skillet, simmer: Pour the sauce through a sieve into a skillet. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the sauce.\nBring to a simmer and reduce heat to maintain the simmer, cook for 10 minutes. Skim off the foam.\nRemove from heat. Use immediately or pour into a glass jar (plastic will get stained) and refrigerate.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Put into a mortar and pestle and grind until powdery.\n3 Make the chermoula sauce: Put 4 cloves garlic, parsley, cilantro, salt, cumin, coriander, paprika, and lemon zest in a food processor. Pulse several times. With the motor running, slowly add in 1/2 cup of olive oil, then the lemon juice. Process until you have a smooth paste.

Let them cook until deep golden brown, about 5 to 6 minutes.\nThen turn them over and cook a few minutes more.\n5 Drain excess fat: Because you are working with skin-on thighs, you will likely render quite a bit of fat. Remove the chicken from the pan and pour off any excess fat. (Do not pour down the drain unless you want to clog your drain pipes.) Return the chicken to the pan.\n5 Spread chermoula on chicken, bake in oven: Spread most of the chermoula sauce on both sides of the chicken thighs, reserving 1/4 cup of the fresh sauce to add later.\nWith the chicken skin-side up, put the skillet in the 350\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the thighs are cooked through and the temperature near the bone is 165\xc2\xb0F when tested with a meat thermometer.\n6 Spoon remaining sauce over chicken: Stir the reserved fresh chermoula sauce in with the pan sauce. Spoon sauce over the chicken to serve.\nServe with couscous or with basmati rice for a gluten-free option.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nAir Fryer Chicken Wings Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hourOptional Refrigeration time: 6 hours\nThe baking powder trick yields super-crispy wings and is worth planning ahead. But you\xe2\x80\x99ll still have delicious wings without it: Omit the baking powder, but still season the wings with the kosher salt before air-frying them.\nIf you can\xe2\x80\x99t find gochujang, try another favorite sauce for chicken wings and use the same air fryer method.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the wings:\n3 pounds chicken wing drumettes and flats\n3 teaspoons baking powder\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\nFor the sauce:\n2 tablespoons gochujang\n2 tablespoons soy sauce\n1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar\n2 teaspoons sesame oil\n1 teaspoon sugar\n3 tablespoons butter, melted and kept warm\nFor the sesame mayonnaise dipping sauce:\n1 cup mayonnaise\n1 tablespoon toasted sesame oil\n3/4 teaspoon sugar\n1/8 teaspoon sriracha\nTo garnish:\nThinly sliced scallions, for garnish\nToasted sesame seeds, for garnish\nThin spears of cucumber\nThin slices of radish\nSpecial equipment:\nAir Fryer\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Season and rest the wings: Pat the wings dry, if needed. In a large bowl, add the wings and toss them with the baking powder and salt until evenly coated.\nSpread the wings around the bowl so they are in a single layer and refrigerate them, uncovered, for at least 6 hours and up to 24 hours.\n2 Air fry the wings: Heat the air fryer to 380\xc2\xb0F. Open the drawer and fit as many wings as you can in it without crowding them (for my 4.4-quart air fryer, this was 1-1/2 pounds of wings, or half the batch). Close the drawer. Cook for 25 minutes, shaking the drawer every 5 minutes to shuffle the wings around.\n3 Make the sauce: As the wings cook, make the sauce. In a medium bowl, whisk together the gochujang, soy sauce, rice wine vinegar, sesame oil, and sugar. Set aside.\n4 Make the sesame mayonnaise: In a small bowl, whisk together the mayonnaise, sesame oil, sugar, and sriracha until smooth. Set aside.\n5 Increase the air fryer temp: Once the wings have cooked for 25 minutes, increase the temperature of the air fryer to 400\xc2\xb0F. Cook the wings for another 5 minutes. This gets them nice and brown and especially crispy.\n6 Sauce and serve the wings: Mix the melted butter with the sauce (it might solidify a bit, but the heat of the wings will re-melt it). Add the wings to a large bowl, pour over half the sauce and toss the wings in the sauce.\n7 Serve and eat: Transfer to a serving platter and sprinkle with scallions and sesame seeds, if you like. Serve immediately, accompanied by the cucumbers, radishes, and sesame mayonnaise for dipping.\n8 Cook the remaining wings: Reduce the temperature of your air fryer back to 380\xc2\xb0F. Repeat steps 2 and 4. Toss them with the remaining sauce.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nAir Fryer Fried Chicken Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 45 minutesMarinating time: 1 hourYield: 10 pieces of fried chicken\nAlternative Pan Fry Method: If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have access to an air fryer, you can make this fried chicken using a traditional pan fry method. Add enough oil to a cast iron skillet so the oil is about 1 1/2 inches up the side of the skillet. Heat oil until it reaches 350\xc2\xb0F. Add chicken pieces and fry for 8 minutes. Flip, and fry for another 8 minutes until golden brown. Test temperature; you might need a few more minutes for the dark meat pieces (thighs and legs).\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the chicken: \n1 4-pound fryer chicken, cut into 10 pieces (2 breasts cut in half, 2 wings, 2 legs, 2 thighs)\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n2 cups buttermilk\nFor the coating:\n2 cups all-purpose flour\n1 tablespoon seasoned salt\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1 tablespoon garlic powder\n1 tablespoon paprika\nSpray olive oil for cooking\nSpecial equipment:\nKrups Air Fryer\nThermapen Instant Read Thermometer\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Marinate the chicken: Season the chicken well with salt and pepper and then add it to a bowl with buttermilk. Chicken pieces should be covered with the buttermilk. Let it sit for at least an hour or up to overnight.\n2 Bread the chicken: To prepare the breading mixture, stir together flour, seasoned salt, salt, pepper, garlic powder, and paprika.\nRemove chicken pieces from buttermilk and shake off any excess; then dip in the flour mix and coat well. Transfer breaded chicken pieces to a clean plate or wire rack to rest.\n3 Air-fry the chicken: You will need to work in two batches if you are doing a full chicken. Spray the basket of your air fryer with nonstick spray. Place half of the pieces in the basket of your air fryer. Try to ensure the pieces don\xe2\x80\x99t touch. Air needs to circulate around them.\nSpray the chicken pieces lightly with spray oil. Place the basket in the air fryer and turn the air fryer to 350\xc2\xb0F. Cook for 14 minutes, then flip the fried chicken with tongs, spray lightly with oil a second time on the bottom side of the chicken, and cook for another 8 to 10 minutes.\nThe half-breast pieces and the wings will be done on the low end of that time range, and the dark meat pieces will need a full 24 to 26 minutes of time to be cooked through. The dark meat pieces should reach 175\xcb\x9aF.\n(NOTE: My method photo here only shows the temp at 148\xcb\x9aF to illustrate that the chicken can LOOK cooked but is actually not cooked through. A meat thermometer is vital.)\nDuring the air frying process, if you pull out the chicken and notice any dry flour spots on the chicken, spray those spots lightly with oil. The breading will never crisp up if it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have a tiny bit of oil to hydrate it. It will just burn.\n4 Serve: When the fried chicken is ready, let it rest on a plate for a few minutes before serving. Serve immediately with salad, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, or your favorite fried chicken sides!\nCooked fried chicken can be stored in the fridge for 5 days and reheated in a 300\xc2\xb0F oven for 8 to 10 minutes.\nHello!

Stirring frequently, cook the cranberries for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they've reduced a bit and thickened to a jelly-like consistency.\nRemove the pan from the stove and add the light brown sugar. Stir constantly to dissolve the sugar and coat the cranberries in a thick glaze.\nAllow the cranberries to cool to room temperature, leaving the spices in it.\n4. Prep your Air Fryer: Set your Cuisinart\xc2\xae Air Fryer Toaster Oven\xe2\x80\x99s function dial to Air Fry and the temperature dial to 300\xc2\xb0F. Remove both the Air Fryer basket and the baking pan from the oven, then turn the on/oven dial to 10 minutes to preheat the oven.\n5. Fill the phyllo cups: While your Air Fryer is heating, fill your phyllo shells with the pieces of brie. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to leave the shells in the packaging while you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to fill them. Remove the shells from the plastic packaging and arrange them, a dozen at a time, in the Air Fryer basket.\n6. Bake the shells: Place the baking pan, with the Air Fryer basket nestled inside, into the oven in position 1. Bake the shells for five minutes.\nOnce the shells have finished baking, remove them from the Air Fryer Toaster Oven and carefully remove them from the basket. Repeat this step, baking the shells by the dozen, until they are all baked.\n7. Prep the rosemary topping: While the shells are baking, pick off the remaining rosemary leaves in clusters of two or three leaves. Set aside to garnish the canap\xc3\xa9s when you\xe2\x80\x99re done topping them with the sauce.\n8. Top with cranberry sauce and garnish: Once you have baked all of the brie-filled shells, top each with a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, leaving the cinnamon stick, vanilla bean (if you used one), rosemary sprigs and slices of ginger in the pan. Pull out any pieces of rosemary orAny remaining cranberry sauce may be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.\nGarnish the top of each canap\xc3\xa9 with the sprigs of rosemary leaves you picked earlier.\n9. Serve! These canap\xc3\xa9s are best served immediately, but can be held at room temperature for up to 2 hours.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Store covered in the refrigerator until ready to serve. You can do this up to 48 hours in advance.\n2 Peel and cut the plantains: Remove the ends of the green plantains with a sharp knife. Score the plantain down its back side and use the fleshy part of your thumbs to push the peel up and away from the plantain.\n3 Preheat your air fryer to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Soak the plaintains: Combine 4 cups of cold water and 1 tablespoon of kosher salt. Slice the plantain into 1 1/2-inch-thick chunks and soak them in water for 20 minutes. (Soaking the plantains prevents browning and keeps the air-fried plantains from drying out while cooking.\n5 Dry then par-fry the plantains: Remove the plantains from the water and dry each one thoroughly. Toss the plantain slices in a bowl with 1 tablespoon of the cooking oil. Make sure each plantain is coated in a thin layer of the oil.\nTransfer the plantains to your air fryer\xe2\x80\x99s basket. Organize in a single layer, leaving a 1/2 inch of space on all sides of the slices to allow the air to circulate properly. Fry until the plantain offers no resistance when pierced with the tip of a knife.

b"Save It Print\nMexican Wedding Cookies Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 18 minutesChilling time: 1 hourYield: 24 to 30 cookies\nYou can substitute any other nut in place of the pecans. Times for toasting in Step 1 will vary based on the size of the nut you use.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the cookie dough:\n1 cup (115 g) pecan pieces\n1 cup (225 g or 2 sticks) unsalted butter at room temperature\n3/4 cup (85 g) powdered sugar, sifted\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n2 cups (280 g) all-purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\nTo roll the cookies:\n1 1/4 cup (145 g) powdered sugar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toast the nuts on the stovetop: Place the nuts in a medium skillet and place over medium heat. Toast the nuts, stirring frequently, until they darken slightly and smell fragrant and nutty, about 5 minutes.\nRemove the pan from heat and let the nuts cool in the pan.\n2 Crush the nuts: Once the toasted nuts are warm to the touch, but not hot, pour them into a quart-size sealable freezer bag. Seal the bag, and then use a rolling pin to roll and crush the nuts until they are crushed into a chunky powder. Set aside until needed.\n(Alternatively, pulse in a food processor until powdery. Be careful of over-processing or the nuts will turn into nut butter!)\n3 Mix the butter and sugar: Place the butter and 3/4 cup powdered sugar in the bowl of stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment. Beat together on medium speed until the sugar is absorbed into the butter and the buttery paste clings to the side of the bowl. Add the vanilla and beat for an additional 30 seconds to incorporate.\n4 Add the flour and salt: Mix on low speed. As the dry ingredients start to absorb into the butter-sugar mixture, you can increase the speed back to medium. Once all the flour is mixed in and a dough has formed, stop the mixer.\n5 Empty the crushed nuts into the bowl with the dough: Mix on low speed to incorporate.\n6 Chill the dough: Scrape the dough onto a piece of plastic wrap and flatten into a disk about 1-inch thick. Wrap tightly with the plastic wrap and place in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour or until the dough is firm.\n7 About 10 minutes before you're ready to bake, preheat the oven to 350F. Line 2 baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon baking mat.\n8 Roll the cookies: Place the 1 1/4 cups of powdered sugar for coating the cookies into a shallow bowl. Remove the chilled dough out of the refrigerator and form into 1-inch balls of dough. (If your dough chilled longer than 1 hour, you may need to let it soften for a few minutes at room temperature.)\nRoll the balls of dough in powdered sugar and place on the baking mat, spaced slightly apart.\n9 Bake for 17 to 19 minutes, or until the cookies start to brown slightly on top and are golden brown on the bottoms. Let the cookies cool on the baking sheet for 10 minutes after baking.\n10 While the cookies are still warm, roll each cookie in the powdered sugar again. Return the cookies to the cooling rack and let cool completely before serving.\nStore at room temperature in an airtight container. They will keep well for at least a week.\nHello!

b'Print\nChocolate Florentine Cookies Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesBake time: 8 minutes per batchYield: 30 florentine cookies\nFlorentine cookies are crisp almond toffee-like cookies that are sandwiched with a layer of chocolate and then drizzled with more chocolate. They have a reputation for being difficult to make but I\xe2\x80\x99ve given some hints and tips on making them easier for you. Just make sure to watch them bake, as they can go from done to burnt fairly quickly.\nMaking these cookies goes more quickly if you have at least two baking sheets so that you can prep the next batch while the previous batch is in the oven.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the cookies:\n2 1/2 cups (290 g) slivered almonds\n1/4 cup (35 g) all-purpose flour\n2 tablespoons natural cocoa powder (not Dutch-process)\n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional but recommended)\n3/4 cup (150 g) white granulated sugar\n1/2 cup (1 stick or 115 g) unsalted butter\n1/4 cup heavy cream\n2 tablespoon honey\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\nTo finish:\n8 to 10 ounces of dark chocolate, chopped\nSpecial equipment:\nFood processor\nSilpat or other silicon baking mat\nThin, flat spatula\nWire cooling rack\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Chop the almonds: Place the slivered almonds in a food processor. Pulse until the almonds are broken down into smaller bits, about 1/4 inch in size. They should be the size of the chopped nuts you would sprinkle over an ice cream sundae.\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a food processor, you can chop the nuts by hand or place them in a ziplock bag and crush them with a wooden rolling pin until they are the right size.\n2 Add the flour and cocoa powder to the food processor bowl. Pulse a couple of times to blend together.\n3 Make the cookie "batter" on the stovetop: In a medium-sized saucepan, place the sugar, butter, cream, and honey. Heat until the sugar is dissolved and the butter has melted. Remove from heat and stir in the vanilla extract.\nAdd the dry almond mixture and stir until incorporated. Set aside to cool for 20 minutes.\n4 Preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xbaF. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicon baking mat.\n5 Spoon out the cookies: Once the batter has cooled (it will still be warm), use a teaspoon measure to spoon out the cookies onto the prepared baking sheet (1 teaspoon per cookie). Space the cookies about 3 inches apart; they will spread a lot during baking. (On a 12 x 18 sheet, I found 6 cookies fit comfortably.)\n6 Flatten the cookies: Dip your finger in some water, then use it to spread the batter into a round circle, with the nuts in a single layer on the pan. This will encourage the batter to spread evenly in a circle.\n7 Bake the cookies: Bake the cookies in the oven for 6 to 8 minutes. If you are using parchment paper, the cookies will bake faster. If you are using a silicon baking sheet, the silicon insulates the heat and it takes a little long to bake (but they will bake more evenly).\nRemove the pan from the oven once the edges of the cookies start to darken and brown and transfer to a cooling rack. Be careful as the cookies go from done to burnt fairly fast.\nWhile the cookies are still warm from the oven, take a look at them and see if any of them are not quite round. If they are not as nicely shaped as you would like, use a spatula to carefully nudge the sides of the cookie into a round circle. You will have to work fairly quickly as the cookies firm up as they cool.\n8 Cool the cookies: Let the cookies cool on the pan for 10 to 20 minutes, until they are set. It\'s fine if they\'re still a little soft, but they should be able to be transferred in one piece without tearing or creating ripples in the cookie.\nIt helps to use a very thin, flat spatula so you can easily slide under each cookie. Also, if you have a wire rack that has crisscross wires, this is ideal for cookies like this since any under-baked cookie will slump a little bit on racks with more widely-spaced wires. Let the cookies cool completely.\n9 Continue baking the cookies in batches until all the batter has been used.\n10 Sandwich the cookies with chocolate: Once the cookies have all been baked and cooled, melt dark chocolate by placing it in a microwave-safe bowl and cooking it in 30 second increments, stirring between each increment. (You can also melt the chocolate on a double boiler, if you prefer.)\nOnce the chocolate has melted, pick two cookies that are roughly the same size and smear a thin layer of chocolate on the bottom of one of them. Place the matching cookie bottom on top and set the cookie sandwich on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a wire rack.\nRepeat with the remaining cookies. Drizzle any remaining chocolate over the Florentines.\n11 Wait for the chocolate to firm up and harden before serving or packaging. Stored in an airtight container, these cookies will keep at room temperature for 3 days, or in the fridge for about 2 weeks.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nFlourless Lemon Almond Cake Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Serves 8\nIt helps to separate the eggs first, while they are cold, and then let them sit to come to room temperature as you prep the other ingredients.  Eggs are easier to separate when cold, and they perform better as leavening agents when at room temperature.\nWhen whipping egg whites, make sure your equipment is perfectly clean. Any fat (or even bits of egg yolk in the whites) can keep the egg whites from properly whipping up.\nIf almond flour is not available at your market, you can grind up blanched, slivered almonds in a food processor until very finely ground.  I would start with a little more than 1 1/3 cups. Our local Whole Foods carries a Bob's Red Mill brand of finely ground blanched almond flour which is what we used for this recipe.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 eggs (large), separated into 4 egg yolks and 4 egg whites, room temperature (see how to separate eggs)\n2 Tbsp lemon zest, packed\n1/2 cup (100 g) white sugar, divided 1/4 cup (50 g) and 1/4 cup (50 g)\n1 1/2 cup lightly scooped (144 g) finely ground blanched almond flour\n1 teaspoon baking powder (make sure your baking powder is fresh!)\n1/4 teaspoon ground cardamom\n1 teaspoon white or cider vinegar\nPinch of salt\nPowdered sugar for sprinkling\nSpecial equipment:\n8 or 9-inch springform pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven, prepare pan: Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175 \xc2\xb0C).  Place a round of parchment paper on the bottom of a 8 or 9-inch springform pan, and grease it and the sides of the pan with butter or cooking spray.\n2 Beat egg yolks, lemon zest, 1/4 cup sugar: In a large bowl, beat together with a wooden spoon the egg yolks, lemon zest, and 1/4 cup sugar until smooth.\n3 Whisk almond flour, baking powder, cardamom, beat into egg yolk mixture: In a separate bowl, whisk together the almond flour, ground cardamom, and baking powder. Add the flour mixture to the egg yolk mixture and beat until well combined. The mixture should resemble a thick paste.\n4 Whip egg whites to soft peaks: With an electric mixer with a very clean bowl and clean whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, starting on low speed and gradually increasing the speed.\nWhen bubbles start to form, add a pinch of salt and the teaspoon of vinegar (both the salt and the vinegar will help the beaten egg whites maintain better structure, as will the sugar in the next step).\nAs the egg whites begin to increase in volume, sprinkle in the remaining 1/4 cup of sugar, a little at a time, as you continue to beat the egg whites. Beat until soft peaks form.\n5 Fold beaten egg whites into almond mixture: Stir a third to a half of the beaten egg whites into the almond mixture to loosen it and make it lighter.\nThen gently fold the remaining whipped egg whites into the batter, a large scoopful at a time.\n6 Scoop batter into pan, bake: Gently scoop the batter into the prepared springform pan and place in the oven. Bake at 350\xc2\xb0F (175 \xc2\xb0C) for 30 minutes.\nRemove from the oven and let cool. Run a sharp knife around the edge of the cake helping it to separate from the side of the pan.\nRelease the springform pan sides, and gently move the cake (on parchment) to a cake serving plate. Sprinkle with a little powdered sugar before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"

Add the cut up pieces of butter and use a pastry cutter to cut into the flour mixture until the butter pieces are no bigger than a pea. (You can use a food processor for this if you want.)\nSprinkle with vanilla and add 3 tablespoons of ice water. Use a fork to work the water and vanilla into the dough. (You can use a food processor.) Add up to a tablespoon more of ice water, just enough so that the dough easily sticks together when you pinch it with your fingers.\nForm the dough into a ball, kneading once or twice if necessary, and flatten into a disk. Wrap the dough disk in plastic and chill for 1 hour.\n2 Roll out the dough, place in tart pan, freeze: Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xb0F (190\xc2\xb0C). Remove dough from refrigerator and let sit for 10 minutes. Place the dough on a lightly floured clean surface. Roll out the dough to a 12-inch round. Place the dough in a 9 1/2-inch-diameter tart pan with a removable bottom.\nPress the dough down and into the sides. Roll the rolling pin over the top of the tart pan to even off the top edges.\nPierce the bottom of the dough in the tart pan all over with fork. Freeze for 30 minutes.\n3 Pre-bake the crust: Bake the crust at 375\xc2\xb0F for 20 minutes, piercing the bottom with fork if bubbles form. Transfer to a rack to cool.\n4 Make the caramel nut filling: Put sugar and 1/4 cup water in heavy medium saucepan with high sides. Heat on medium-low heat and stir until sugar dissolves.\nOnce the sugar has dissolved, increase the heat to medium high. Boil without stirring until caramel is deep amber color, occasionally swirling the pan, about 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium.\nSlowly stir in the cream. Be careful as the mixture will bubble up significantly (this is why we are using a high sided pot). Stir until the caramel is smooth.\nAdd the butter, honey and vanilla. Stir until the butter has all melted.\nStir in all of the nuts.\n5 Bake: Pour caramel mixture into the pre-baked crust. Bake at 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C) 20 minutes.

b"Save It Print\nHomemade Almond Roca Recipe\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 20 minutes\nUse an inexpensive chocolate such as Hershey's. It has low cocoa butter content. If you use a premium chocolate with a high cocoa butter content, unless you temper the chocolate first (look up directions online), the cocoa butter may separate into white streaks as the melted chocolate cools.\nYou can use other kinds of nuts such as pecans or macadamia and white chocolate.\nDo not attempt to make this on a humid or rainy day. Do not double the recipe, make one batch at a time.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup sugar\n1/4 cup water\n1 Tbsp light corn syrup\n1/2 lb butter (2 sticks - NO substitutes!)\n1/2 lb. slivered almonds (2 cups)\n1/2 lb. bar of regular Hershey's dark chocolate (7 oz okay)\nMETHOD\n1 Melt butter with sugar, syrup and water in a pan (such as a large non-stick frying pan) on medium to medium-high temperature. Stir continuously with a wooden spoon.\nWhen butter is melted, add the almonds.\n2 Cook until the mixture turns a warm amber color, and the boiling sounds like a crackle: When mixture comes to a rolling boil, set your timer for a minimum of 10 minutes and keep stirring (no more than 15 minutes). The mixture will thicken and turn darker in color. The almonds will roast.\nKeep stirring and cooking until you hear it crackle. If you don't cook it long enough it will not harden, so keep stirring and listen for the crackling sound.\nElise's note: I have found it very hard to distinguish between the boiling sound and the crackling sound in this recipe. A better guideline for me is by color. When the mixture turns a warm amber color, at about 11 or 12 minutes into the boiling, that's the time to pour it out. Wait too long and it will burn.\nIf you try to make this, please read all the comments listed below. It's actually trickier than one would think.\n3 Pour mixture out onto a large cookie sheet: When the mixture crackles, pour the mixture out onto a large sheet pan or cookie sheet and spread it as thin as possible with a fork.\n4 Spread chocolate over the top: While the almond mixture is still hot, break up the chocolate into chunks and distribute it over the almond mixture and let it melt. Spread it evenly on the top.\n5 Cool to room temp: Let the almond roca cool to room temperature. When cool you can lift the whole thing off the pan and break into small pieces.\nHello!

Depending on the original size of the sheet, you will cut it into squares or rectangles. Remember, this is fancy but rustic, so the exact size of the tarts is flexible!\nINGREDIENTS\n1 sheet all-butter puff pastry (14 to 16 ounces), thawed\n1 cup almond flour\n1/2 cup sugar\n1/8 teaspoon salt\n5 tablespoons unsalted butter, at room temperature, cut into slices\n1 large egg\n2 tablespoons all-purpose flour\n1 tablespoon amaretto or 1 teaspoon pure almond extract\n1 teaspoon vanilla\n1 1/2 pounds (about 4 medium) ripe peaches, cut into 1-inch wedges\n2 tablespoons turbinado sugar\n3 tablespoons apple jelly or apricot jam\n1 tablespoon water\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven: Line a baking sheet with parchment and preheat the oven to 375\xc2\xbaF.\n2 Prepare the dough: On a lightly floured work surface, unfold the puff pastry. Lightly roll it with a rolling pin to even it out if there are any gaps or wrinkles. Transfer the dough to the parchment-lined baking sheet.\nWith a pizza cutter or knife, cut the dough into 9 pieces to make four-inch squares or similar size rectangles. The exact size depends upon the original shape of the dough. Spread them apart on the baking sheet. Refrigerate while you make the filling.\n3 Make the frangipane: In a food processor fitted with the metal blade, pulse the almond flour, sugar, and salt for a few seconds to mix. Add the butter pieces and pulse until the butter is incorporated with no large visible pieces.\nAdd the egg, all-purpose flour, amaretto (or almond extract), and vanilla and process until the frangipane is smooth. It should have the consistency of natural almond butter, thick but runny.\n4 Assemble the tarts: On each square of pastry, spoon about 1 tablespoon of the frangipane. It will spread out naturally on the pastry, and even further once you add peaches. If some spills over the edges that\xe2\x80\x99s fine. If your frangipane doesn\xe2\x80\x99t spread, feel free to push it around the tart with the back of your spoon. You may have some frangipane left over, depending on the size of your pastry squares.\nSet 5 to 6 wedges of fruit on top of each tart\xe2\x80\x94no need to be too fussy about their arrangement. Sprinkle each with the turbinado sugar.\n5 Bake the tarts: Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the peaches are soft and the frangipane and pastry are golden.\n6 Glaze the tarts: In a small microwave-safe bowl, heat the jelly or jam and water for 30 seconds, or until liquefied.

The pieces should look like a rough crumble.\nAdd the cocoa powder, maple syrup, almond butter, vanilla extract, and sea salt and pulse until the mixture is smooth and thick; it will start to peel away from the edge of the bowl.\nWhen this happens, stop the food processor; if it keeps whirring away, it may get stuck because these ingredients are, well, sticky! Keep a close eye on this, as it will come together quickly.\n2 Add the almonds: Add the almonds and pulse a few times to incorporate them. You want them sort of irregularly sized, so that some pieces are still pretty crunchy and offer a variety of textures.\n3 Roll the date balls: Line a rimmed baking sheet with parchment or wax paper. Place the coconut in a small bowl and the cocoa powder in another bowl.\nUsing a cookie scoop measuring about 1 1/2 tablespoons (like this one) and sprayed with cooking spray for easy release, scoop out the mixture, roll it into golf-ball shapes, and roll in the shredded coconut or the cocoa powder. (I usually do some in coconut and some in cocoa powder, and leave some plain.)\n4 Chill and store the date balls: Transfer the date balls to the baking sheet and chill them for a few hours or overnight, if needed. Once they've firmed up, transfer to a plastic lidded container and keep in the fridge for several weeks, but I've never, ever, had them last that long. They are usually consumed too quickly.\nHello!

Stir in the julienned or grated apple.\n3 Pour the batter into the pan and bake the cake: Pour the batter into the cake pan, taking care not to move the parchment around. Spread out the batter in an even layer using an offset spatula or butter knife, then tap the cake pan against the countertop to remove any air bubbles.\n4 Bake the cake: Bake the cake for 30 minutes, until it is browned around the edges and a toothpick inserted in the middle comes out clean. You may also use a probe thermometer to test for doneness\xe2\x80\x94the center of the cake should be 210\xc2\xbaF.\n5 While the cake is baking, make the glaze and toast the almonds: In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, honey, and almond milk. Cover the bowl and set it aside until needed.\nToast the sliced almonds in a skillet over medium heat until they are lightly browned, about five minutes. Shake the pan often so that the almonds are browned evenly. When they are done, immediately transfer to bowl to cool.\n6 Transfer the cake to a cooling rack: Allow the finished cake rest for 5 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pan to and invert the cake to a cooling rack. Peel the parchment off the bottom of the cake and flip it right side up.\n7 While the cake is still warm, pour the glaze over the top. Spread the glaze so that it drips over the edges of the cake. While the glaze is still wet, sprinkle the almonds on top.\n8 Let the cake cool to room temperature and serve. The cake can also be made and glazed up to a day ahead.\nHello!

b'Print\nSopa Seca de Fideo with Tomatillos Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4\nIf you want, you can substitute a cup of prepared tomatillo salsa verde for the sauce you make in step one. The original recipe calls for using Hoja Santa cheese, which is goat cheese wrapped in aromatic Hoja Santa leaves. It\'s a lovely cheese to use if you can find it, otherwise regular goat cheese will do.\nINGREDIENTS\n3/4 pound tomatillos (about 6 medium sized), husks removed\n1 to 2 serrano chiles\n1/4 medium onion\n1 clove garlic\n2 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, plus extra for garnish\n4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided\n4 ounces fresh Mexican chorizo, casing removed, crumbled\n8 ounces capellini, or angel hair pasta, broken into 1 to 1 1/2-inch pieces\n1 teaspoon sea salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n2 1/2 cups chicken stock\n4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled\n1 avocado, seeded, peeled, diced\nCrema fresca or sour cream\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Broil tomatillos, chiles, onion: Place the tomatillos, serrano chiles, an quarter onion on a baking sheet lightly greased with olive oil. Broil for about 15 minutes until somewhat charred and blistered. Remove the stems from the serranos.\n2 Make tomatillo sauce: Working in batches if necessary, pur\xc3\xa9e the chiles, tomatillos, onion, a clove of garlic, and 2 tablespoons of the chopped cilantro in a blender, making sure not to fill the blender more than halfway. Once blended you should have about a cup of sauce.\n3 Cook the chorizo: Heat 2 Tbsp of oil in a large saucepan on medium heat. Add the chorizo and cook 3 to 4 minutes until cooked through and crispy. Use a wooden spoon to crumble up the chorizo as it cooks.\nUse a slotted spoon to remove the chorizo to a paper-towel lined plate, keeping the fat and oil in the pan.\n4 Brown the dry noodles: Place the broken up dry pasta into the pan and increase the heat to medium high. Lightly brown the dry noodles in the chorizo oil. Remove the pasta from the pan and set aside.\n5 Cook the tomatillo sauce: Add the remaining 2 Tbsp of oil to the pan and heat on medium high heat. Add the tomatillo sauce and the salt. The sauce should bubble up from the heat of the pan. Cook for about a minute, allowing the sauce to reduce by about a quarter cup. Dragging your spoon through the sauce should leave a trail for a second or two.\n6 Add pasta: Add the pasta back to the pan with the tomatillo sauce and cook it until it has absorbed the liquid.\n7 Add stock, simmer and cook: Add the chicken stock. Bring to a boil and reduce to a simmer. Let cook undisturbed for about 15 minutes, or until the pasta is soft and the stock absorbed. The pasta will be past "al dente" but shouldn\'t be cooked to a mush.\n8 Serve: Place in serving bowls and garnish with crumbled chorizo, goat cheese, avocado, cilantro, and crema fresca or sour cream.\nHello!

Wash your hands thoroughly after handling and do not touch your eyes or the area near your eyes with your hands for several hours.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 ripe avocados\n1/4 teaspoon of salt, more to taste\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice or lemon juice\n2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup of minced red onion or thinly sliced green onion\n1-2 serrano chiles, stems and seeds removed, minced\n2 tablespoons cilantro (leaves and tender stems), finely chopped\nA dash of freshly grated black pepper\n1/2 ripe tomato, seeds and pulp removed, chopped\nRed radishes or jicama, to garnish\nTortilla chips, to serve\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cut the avocado, remove flesh: Cut the avocados in half. Remove the pit. Score the inside of the avocado with a blunt knife and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. (See How to Cut and Peel an Avocado.) Place in a bowl.\n2 Mash with a fork: Using a fork, roughly mash the avocado. (Don't overdo it! The guacamole should be a little chunky.)\n3 Add salt, lime juice, and the rest: Sprinkle with salt and lime (or lemon) juice. The acid in the lime juice will provide some balance to the richness of the avocado and will help delay the avocados from turning brown.\nAdd the chopped onion, cilantro, black pepper, and chiles. Chili peppers vary individually in their hotness. So, start with a half of one chili pepper and add to the guacamole to your desired degree of hotness.\nRemember that much of this is done to taste because of the variability in the fresh ingredients. Start with this recipe and adjust to your taste.\nChilling tomatoes hurts their flavor, so if you want to add chopped tomato to your guacamole, add it just before serving.\n4 Serve: Serve immediately, or if making a few hours ahead, place plastic wrap on the surface of the guacamole and press down to cover it and to prevent air reaching it. (The oxygen in the air causes oxidation which will turn the guacamole brown.) Refrigerate until ready to serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Be careful while handling the chile peppers. Use a plastic baggie or disposable gloves to handle them, or wash your hands thoroughly with soap and hot water after handling and avoid touching your eyes for several hours.\nSet aside some of the seeds from the peppers. If the salsa isn't hot enough, you can add a few for more heat.\n2 Make the salsa: Place all of the ingredients in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade. Pulse only a few times, just enough to finely dice the ingredients and not enough to pur\xc3\xa9e. If you don't have a food processor, you can finely dice by hand.\n3 Adjust seasonings: Place in a serving bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste. If the chilies make the salsa too hot, add some more chopped tomato. If it's not hot enough, carefully add a few of the seeds from the chilies, or add a little more ground cumin.\nLet the salsa sit for an hour (room temperature or chilled) for the flavors to combine.\n4 Serve: Serve with chips, tortillas, tacos, burritos, tostadas, quesadillas, pinto or black beans.

If you use cherry tomatoes, just quarter them, don't bother blanching or peeling them.\nINGREDIENTS\n6 or 7 ripe tomatoes (about 1 1/2 lbs)\n2 cloves garlic, minced (about 2 teaspoons)\n1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon balsamic vinegar\n6-8 fresh basil leaves, thinly sliced* or chopped\n3/4 teaspoon sea salt, more or less to taste\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper, more or less to taste\n1 baguette French bread or similar Italian bread\n1/4 cup (60 ml) olive oil\n*To thinly slice basil leaves, stack the leaves on top of each other and roll up like a cigar. Then make thin slices from one end of the basil cigar to the other.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Blanch and peel the tomatoes: Bring 2 quarts of water to a boil. As the water is heating make shallow cuts in a cross pattern at the tip ends of the tomatoes (this will make the tomatoes easier to peel).\nOnce the water is boiling, remove the pot from the heat. Put the tomatoes in the hot water and blanch for 1 minute.\nRemove with a slotted spoon and let sit until cool enough to handle. Then gently peel off the tomato skins. Cut out the stem base with a paring knife.\nCut the tomatoes into halves or quarters and squeeze out most of the juices and seeds.\n2 Preheat oven to 450\xc2\xb0F (230\xc2\xb0C) with a rack in the top slot of the oven.\n3 Chop tomatoes, toss them with garlic, olive oil, vinegar, basil, salt and pepper: Finely chop the tomatoes and place them in a medium bowl. Mix in the minced garlic, 1 Tbsp extra virgin olive oil, and the balsamic vinegar.\nStir in the thinly sliced basil and add salt and freshly ground black pepper, adding more to taste. Note, tomatoes love salt; you may need to add more than you expect.\n4 Toast the baguette slices: Use a bread knife to slice the baguette on the diagonal making half-inch thick slices. Brush one side of each slice with olive oil (a pastry brush helps here) and place olive oil-side down on a baking sheet or roasting pan.\nThe baguette slices will toast best in the top rack of your oven, so you may need to work in batches to toast them all.\nWhen the oven has reached 450\xc2\xb0F (230\xc2\xb0C) place the slices in the oven on the top rack and toast for 5 to 6 minutes until lightly browned around the edges.\nIf you want you can toast the bread slices without coating them first in olive oil. Toast them until lightly browned on both sides. Then cut a clove of garlic in half and rub over one side of the toast. Then brush with olive oil. (See Easiest Ever Garlic Bread.)\n5 Serve toasted bread with tomato mixture: Arrange the toasted bread on a platter, olive oil side facing up (the olive oil will help create a temporary barrier keeping the bread from getting soggy from the chopped tomatoes).\nEither serve the toasts plain with a bowl of the tomato bruschetta mixture on the side for people to top their own, or use a spoon to gently top each toasted bread slice with some of the tomato mixture. If you top each slice individually, do it right before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

In a separate small bowl, add eggs and water and whisk together. Add the egg mixture to the bowl with the cauliflower and toss to coat. Once the cauliflower is coated with the egg mixture, toss with breadcrumbs and coat well.\n3 Air-fry the cauliflower: Spray the basket of an air fryer with nonstick spray and place as many cauliflower florets in the basket as will fit in a single layer. Return the basket to the fryer and cook at 350\xcb\x9aF for 7 minutes. Then flip the florets and fry for another 7 minutes.\nRepeat until all cauliflower is done.\n4 Serve! Serve cauliflower immediately once all batches are done, or serve on a rolling basis as the batches come out of the fryer. Cauliflower is best right out of the fryer! Serve with the blue cheese dip as an appetizer or side dish.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Save It Print\nSwedish Meatballs Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4 to 6 as a main, 8 to 12 as an appetizer\nLingonberry jelly is traditionally used with Swedish meatballs; you can substitute cranberry, red currant or raspberry jelly if you can't find lingonberry jelly.\nThis recipe serves 4 to 6 people and can easily be doubled for serving a party.\nINGREDIENTS\nMeatballs:\n1 Tbsp butter\n1/2 large yellow or white onion, peeled, grated (use the large holes of a box cheese grater)\n1/4 cup milk\n3 slices of bread, crusts removed, bread cut into cubes (2 cups of cubed bread)\n1 large egg\n3/4 pound ground beef\n1/2 pound ground pork\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 teaspoon black pepper\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground nutmeg\n1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom\nSauce:\n3 Tbsp butter\n3 Tbsp flour\n2 cups beef stock\n1/4 cup sour cream (use full-fat sour cream or the sauce may curdle)\nSalt and pepper\n2 Tbsp of Lingonberry, red currant, raspberry or cranberry jelly, less or more to taste (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Soak bread in milk, shred: Place the cubed bread in a large bowl and mix with the milk. Let sit for 5 to 10 minutes for the bread to absorb all of the milk. Once the bread has soaked up the milk, shred with the tines of a fork or by hand.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 grated onion: Melt the butter in a saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium-high heat. Stir in the grated onion and cook until translucent and softened, 3-4 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool for a minute.\n3 Make meatball mixture with bread, onions, eggs, meat, spices: Stir the cooled onions into the milk bread mixture. Add the eggs, ground pork and beef, salt, pepper, nutmeg, and cardamom. Use your (clean) hands to mix everything together until well combined.\n(If you have extra time, chilling the mixture for 20 minutes or so will make it easier to roll out the meatballs.)\n4 Form meatballs: Use your hands to form the mixture into meatballs about 1 1/4-inch to 1 1/2-inch wide and place them on a plate or sheet pan. This recipe should make about 40 meatballs. Note that the meatballs will be a bit on the wet side.\n5 Brown meatballs on all sides: Heat 3 Tbsp of butter in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. When the butter is melted and foamy, start adding some meatballs to the pan.\nWorking in batches as to not crowd the pan, slowly brown the meatballs on all sides. Use a spoon or tongs to turn them. Handle the meatballs gently so they do not break apart as you turn them.\n   Once the meatballs have browned on all sides and are just cooked through, remove them from the pan to a bowl. You'll warm the meatballs in the sauce later.\nOnce you have removed the meatballs from the pan, wipe out the butter and browned and blackened bits with a paper towel and rinse out the pan.\nWe'll want to start with fresh butter because that way we won't pick up any burnt bits from the pan, and we will be able to more accurately gauge the amount of fat in the pan for making the meatball sauce in the next step.\n6 Make a roux: To make the sauce, first make the roux. Add 3 Tbsp of fresh butter to the pan. Heat the butter in the pan on medium heat until it melts and starts to bubble up.\nSlowly whisk in 3 Tbsp of flour. Stir until smooth. Continue to stir, allowing the flour mixture to cook, several minutes, until the roux is the color of coffee-with-cream.\n   7 Add stock to roux to make sauce: When the roux has cooked to a lovely shade of light brown, slowly add the stock to the roux, stirring as you add the stock.\nThe stock will sputter at first and the roux may seize up, but keep adding the stock slowly and keep stirring. Eventually the sauce will loosen and become silky.\n8 Stir in sour cream and jelly if using: Remove the pan from heat and stir in the sour cream. If you are including jelly, either stir it in now or serve it on the side. Taste for seasonings and add more salt and pepper to taste (I use about 1/2 teaspoon of kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper.)\n9 Add meatballs to sauce: Return the meatballs to the pan with the sauce and cook on low heat to warm the meatballs through for a few minutes.\n10 Serve: Serve over mashed potatoes or egg noodles. Or serve individual Swedish meatballs dipped in gravy as an appetizer.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nHow to Make Naan\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 10 minutesRise time: 6 hoursYield: 16 naan\nINGREDIENTS\n1 cup lukewarm milk\n1 1/2 teaspoons active dry yeast\n2 teaspoons sugar\n4 cups all-purpose flour + extra for dusting\n2 teaspoons kosher salt\n2 tablespoons olive oil or canola oil + extra for greasing the bowl\n1/2 cup plain yogurt\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare a bowl: Lightly grease a large bowl with a little bit of oil. You will put your dough in this bowl to let it rise. Set the bowl aside.\n2 Prepare the dough: In a Pyrex liquid measuring cup or a small mixing bowl, combine the lukewarm milk, sugar, and active dry yeast. The milk should be just warm to the touch. If it\xe2\x80\x99s too hot you can kill the yeast. Let it sit for 5 minutes.\nIn another large mixing bowl, whisk the flour and salt together. Add yogurt, oil and milk-yeast mixture. Use a wooden spoon or your hands to combine the dough. The dough should be soft and sticky at this point.\n3 Knead the dough: Dust your countertop with flour. Transfer the dough to the counter. Knead together until a soft dough forms, about 5 minutes. If the dough feels dry and is too tough to knead, add about 1-2 tablespoons of water, a little bit at a time, until the dough is easier to work with.\n4 Let the dough rise: Transfer the dough to the greased bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap or a damp towel. Place in a dark, warm, dry place. I place it in my oven (it\xe2\x80\x99s not on) to let it rise, but your countertop is fine. Let the dough rise for 3-4 hours or until it more than doubles in size.\n5 Punch down the dough and let it rise again: Punch the risen dough down. Knead for another minute. Return the dough to the bowl, cover it again and let it rise for another 45 minutes to 1 hour.\n6 Divide the dough: Dust your countertop with flour. Turn the dough out onto the counter and knead it for another minute or two until its smooth. Divide the dough into 16 smaller balls of equal size (about 2 ounces each).\nUsing a rolling pin, roll the balls into a teardrop shape. About 2-3 inches wide, 6-7 inches long, and about 1/8 inch thick. They don\xe2\x80\x99t have to be perfectly uniform.\n7 Cook the naan: If using herbs or spices, sprinkle one side of the bread with those now. Brush the other side with water. Set a medium-sized heavy pan or cast iron skillet with a lid over medium-high heat.\nCheck the heat of the pan by flicking water on it. If it evaporates on contact, it\xe2\x80\x99s ready. Once the pan is hot, place the naan wet side down into the skillet.\nCover it with a lid. Let it cook for about 30 seconds or until you see bubbles on it. Flip the naan, brush it with butter or ghee, and cook it uncovered for another 10 seconds. Serve it hot.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nMussels in White Wine Sauce Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 2 as a meal, 4 as an appetizer or side dish\nWhen purchasing mussels be sure they smell like the ocean, not fishy.\nDon't buy any whose shells are cracked or open or any that refuse to close their shells when you handle or tap them, those are likely dying or dead.\nTry to cook the mussels immediately (unwrap them as soon as you get home), but if you have to wait place them in a bowl and cover them with a damp towel so they can breathe.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 pounds mussels, scrubbed clean under running water\n1/2 cup dry white wine\n2 tablespoons butter\n1/4 cup minced shallots\n1 tablespoon minced garlic\n2 teaspoons flour (optional, omit for gluten-free version)\n1/4 cup minced parsley\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Clean and prep mussels: Put the mussels in a bowl of salted water (1 Tbsp salt per quart of water) for 10-15 minutes. Throw out any that are wide open or refuse to close when you handle them as these ones are likely dead.\nLooking over the closed mussels, see if any still have their beards (long hairy byssal threads which help anchor the mussel to surfaces) and pull them out, pulling slowly and strongly towards the hinge of the shell.\n2 Put wine, mussels in bottom of large pot, steam until mussels open: Put 1/2 cup of dry white wine in the bottom of a large pot (at least 4-quart). Add the mussels to the pot. Cover and bring to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. As the mussels cook, they will release their highly flavored water into the pot.\nCook until shells have opened, and the mussels are just cooked, looking steamed and soft, 5 to 7 minutes. Take care not to overcook, or the mussels will be rubbery and hard.\n3 Remove cooked mussels, save the cooking liquid: Once the mussels are cooked, carefully remove them from the pot to a bowl, one-by-one using tongs, including those that have broken loose from their shells. Do not discard the liquid in the pot!\nLet the water in the pot settle for a minute. Any grit will settle to the bottom. Gently pour out the cooking water into a measuring cup, leaving the grit in the pot to discard of later. If the water you've measured out is still a little gritty, filter out the grit using a sieve.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 shallots and garlic in butter, add flour: Melt the butter in a medium-sized saucepan. Add the shallots and cook a couple minutes until translucent. Add the garlic and cook a minute more. If you want your sauce to be a little thick, add a teaspoon or two of flour to the pan, stir to combine. (Otherwise skip the flour.)\n5 Add mussel cooking water to create sauce: Slowly add about a cup of the filtered mussel cooking water to the saucepan, stirring to create a smooth sauce. Add the minced parsley to the sauce.\n6 Pour sauce over mussels to serve: Place mussels in serving bowls. Pour some sauce over each bowl of mussels.\nServe immediately. Serve with crusty bread for dipping in the sauce.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print"

Mix well and simmer until most of the berries have burst, about 15 minutes.\nStrain mixture through a fine mesh strainer into a bowl, pressing the cranberry mush against the strainer with the side of a rubber spatula. (Be sure to scrape the outside of the sieve with the spatula.) Add cayenne to taste.\n2 Prepare the meatballs: While the cranberries are cooking, prepare the meatballs. In a small bowl, put the torn bread and sprinkle it with the milk. Use a fork to pulverize the bread a bit. In a large bowl, use the same fork to whisk together the ricotta and the egg until smooth. Add the ground turkey, salt, thyme, fennel seeds and milk-sprinkled bread.\nGently mix with your (clean) hands until the ingredients are all incorporated. Don't overwork the meatball mixture or the meatballs will become too dense.\n3 Gently roll out small meatballs about an 1 inch wide with the palms of your hands and set them on a baking sheet or large plate.\n4 Brown the meatballs: Heat 2 Tbsp vegetable oil in a wide saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium heat. Working in batches, add the meatballs, taking care not to crowd the pan, and brown all over. Use a fork to gentle nudge the meatballs, turning them.\nNote that the meatballs will probably be a bit on the wet side, which may cause some splattering as you cook them in the oil. To reduce that, you may want to sprinkle some flour on the meatballs, or roll them in flour, before they go in the pan. Add more oil to the pan as needed.\n5 Add glaze and simmer: Once the meatballs are browned and the glaze has been strained, add the glaze to the pan with the meatballs. Let simmer, uncovered, until the glaze reduces a bit and the meatballs cook through, about 5 minutes.\nRemove the meatballs to a serving dish. Pour over remaining cranberry glaze. If the glaze during this process is too thick, add a little water. If too thin, let simmer a little longer.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nBacon-Wrapped Shrimp Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 10 minutesBrining time (optional) time: 30 minutesYield: Makes 12 pieces\nYou'll need about 1 strip of bacon for every 2 shrimp.\nI highly recommend brining the shrimp first. The brine will help keep the shrimp from drying out in the time it takes for the bacon to cook.\nIf grilling, I recommend using long, flat skewers which make turning the shrimp on the grill easier. If you don't have flat skewers, I've used two thin bamboo skewers (soaked in water for 30 minutes beforehand) to the same effect.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the brine (optional, but recommended):\n1/4 cup (Diamond Crystal) kosher salt (if using Morton's kosher salt, use only 3 tablespoons)\n1/4 cup sugar\n4 cups water\n1 cup ice\nFor the bacon-wrapped shrimp:\n1 pound (12 to 20 count), raw, peeled and deveined shrimp (tail on)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\nZest from 1 lime\n2 tablespoons lime juice\n1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder or chili powder (less or more to taste)\n6 to 10 strips thin bacon, cut in half (half as many pieces of bacon as there are shrimp)\nSpecial equipment:\nSkewers (for grilling) or toothpicks (for oven)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brine the shrimp (optional, but recommended): Whisk the salt, sugar, and water until the salt and sugar dissolve. Add the ice and the shrimp, and let sit for 30 minutes (no longer). Remove the shrimp from the brine.\n2 Prepare grill or preheat oven: Prepare grill on high, direct heat (if grilling) or preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. If grilling and using thin bamboo or wood skewers, soak them in water first for 30 minutes.\n3 Season the shrimp: Mix together in a small bowl the lime zest, lime juice, olive oil, and chipotle powder. Stir the shrimp into the lime chipotle mixture; make sure each piece is well coated.\n4 Partially cook the bacon: Spread the bacon pieces out over several layers of paper towels on a microwave-safe plate. Cover with another layer of paper towel. Microwave on high until the bacon fat begins to melt but the bacon is still somewhat pliable, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.\n5 Wrap the shrimp with bacon: Working one at a time, wrap a half piece of partially cooked bacon around each piece of shrimp.\n6 Prep the shrimp for cooking: If you are grilling, thread the shrimp onto skewers.\nIf you are using the oven, secure each the bacon onto the shrimp with toothpicks. Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp on a foil-lined baking pan. Brush remaining lime chipotle mixture on the outside of the bacon-wrapped shrimp.\n7 Grill or bake the shrimp: Grill uncovered for 3 minutes on each side (less or more time depending on the heat of your grill), or bake in the 400\xc2\xb0F oven for 8 to 11 minutes, or until the bacon is lightly browned and the shrimp is cooked through.\nHello!

And brie is mild in flavor, but when served with foods that are tart (such as cranberries), the creaminess is amplified. Don\xe2\x80\x99t concern yourself with removing the rind from your wheel of brie: it\xe2\x80\x99s completely edible!\nINGREDIENTS\nSpiced Cranberry Sauce\n1-inch piece of ginger, or 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger\n1 vanilla bean, or 1 1/2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n1 (12-ounce) bag (about 3 1/2 cups) fresh or frozen cranberries, rinsed\n1 3-inch cinnamon stick (or 1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon)\n3 sprigs of fresh rosemary, divided\nJuice of 1 naval orange (about 1 /2 cup)\n1 tablespoon of orange zest\n1/4 cup maple syrup\nPinch of kosher salt\n1/2 cup packed light brown sugar\nCanap\xc3\xa9s\n8 ounces brie cheese, cut into 1\xe2\x80\x9d cubes\n2 (1.9 ounce) boxes fully baked phyllo shells (30)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1. Prep the ginger and vanilla: Peel and then thinly slice the ginger (using the edge of a spoon is the easiest way). Use a sharp paring knife to split the vanilla bean down its length.\nOpen the vanilla bean slightly to ensure the seeds are extracted during cooking.\n2. Make the Cranberry Topping: In a 3-quart saucepan, combine the ginger, vanilla bean, cranberries, cinnamon stick, 1 sprig of rosemary, orange juice and zest, maple syrup, and the salt.\nStir the ingredients together and heat over medium-high heat for 3 minutes, or until the mixture starts to boil.\n3. Reduce the topping: Reduce the heat to low, and allow the cranberries to cook until they begin to split open. Stirring frequently, cook the cranberries for 8 to 10 minutes, or until they've reduced a bit and thickened to a jelly-like consistency.\nRemove the pan from the stove and add the light brown sugar. Stir constantly to dissolve the sugar and coat the cranberries in a thick glaze.\nAllow the cranberries to cool to room temperature, leaving the spices in it.\n4. Prep your Air Fryer: Set your Cuisinart\xc2\xae Air Fryer Toaster Oven\xe2\x80\x99s function dial to Air Fry and the temperature dial to 300\xc2\xb0F. Remove both the Air Fryer basket and the baking pan from the oven, then turn the on/oven dial to 10 minutes to preheat the oven.\n5. Fill the phyllo cups: While your Air Fryer is heating, fill your phyllo shells with the pieces of brie. It\xe2\x80\x99s easier to leave the shells in the packaging while you\xe2\x80\x99re trying to fill them. Remove the shells from the plastic packaging and arrange them, a dozen at a time, in the Air Fryer basket.\n6. Bake the shells: Place the baking pan, with the Air Fryer basket nestled inside, into the oven in position 1. Bake the shells for five minutes.\nOnce the shells have finished baking, remove them from the Air Fryer Toaster Oven and carefully remove them from the basket. Repeat this step, baking the shells by the dozen, until they are all baked.\n7. Prep the rosemary topping: While the shells are baking, pick off the remaining rosemary leaves in clusters of two or three leaves. Set aside to garnish the canap\xc3\xa9s when you\xe2\x80\x99re done topping them with the sauce.\n8. Top with cranberry sauce and garnish: Once you have baked all of the brie-filled shells, top each with a teaspoon of cranberry sauce, leaving the cinnamon stick, vanilla bean (if you used one), rosemary sprigs and slices of ginger in the pan. Pull out any pieces of rosemary orAny remaining cranberry sauce may be stored in the refrigerator for up to one week.\nGarnish the top of each canap\xc3\xa9 with the sprigs of rosemary leaves you picked earlier.\n9. Serve! These canap\xc3\xa9s are best served immediately, but can be held at room temperature for up to 2 hours.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Fill a saucepan with 1 inch of water and insert a steamer basket. (If you don't have a steamer basket, that's ok.)\nBring the water to a boil, gently place 6 eggs in the steamer basket or directly in the saucepan. Cover the pot. Set your timer for 15 minutes. Remove eggs and set in icy cold water to cool. For more advice, see our How to Steam Hard Boiled Eggs.

Remove from oven and place in a clean dish towel, rub to remove the outer skins.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 (8-ounce, 225 g) round of brie (we recommend President brand, it melts well)\n1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts (skins removed), lightly chopped\n1/2 cup (120 ml) sherry vinegar or apple cider vinegar\n5 Tbsp honey\nPinch of salt\n1 small sprig rosemary\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the sauce: Place the vinegar, honey, salt, and 5 or 6 needles from the rosemary sprig into a small saucepan. Stir to combine. Heat on medium high heat until simmering. Then lower the heat to low and simmer until the mixture starts to darken in color and the consistency thickens to a thin syrup, about 5 to 10 minutes. (Note if you find that you have over-reduced the sauce, resulting in hard candy not syrup, you can add water to it and heat it again.)\nRemove from heat and stir in the hazelnuts.\n2 Bake the brie: While the sauce is simmering, start on the brie. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C). Use a serrated knife to slice off the very top of the brie round, exposing the cheese on one side. Place on a parchment paper or Silpat lined baking sheet (cut side up). Bake until just soft and bubbly, about 15 minutes. (Jiggle the pan to see if the cheese has melted all the way through.)\n3 Drizzle the brie with sauce: Remove the brie from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two.

b'Save It Print\nGrilled Artichokes Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon chopped fresh herbs such as rosemary, oregano, thyme\n1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, cut in half (no need to peel)\n1 bay leaf\n1 lemon, cut into wedges\n2 to 4 large globe artichokes\nSalt\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Steep herbs in warm olive oil: Place chopped fresh herbs in a small bowl (not the bay leaf), cover with olive oil. Microwave on high heat for 30 seconds (or heat oil and herbs on the stovetop until warm). Let the herbs steep in the warm olive oil while you prepare the artichokes.\n2 Prep the artichokes: Prepare a large pot with an inch of water at the bottom. Add the cut cloves of garlic and the bay leaf, and place a steamer rack in the pot.\nTo prepare the artichokes, have lemon wedges ready. If you want a nice presentation, use scissors to snip away the pointy tips of the artichoke leaves. As you trim the artichokes, rub the cut areas with juice from the lemon wedges to prevent the artichokes from turning brown from oxidation.\nUse a vegetable peeler to cut away the thick outer layer of the artichoke stems. Trim the stems to 2 inches from the base of the artichoke. Cut off and discard the top 1/2 inch of the artichokes. Cut the artichokes in half.\nUse a strong metal spoon to scoop out the fuzzy chokes and the small inner artichoke leaves. Rub lemon juice all over the inside and exposed cut areas of the artichokes.\n\n3 Steam the artichokes: Heat the water in the large pot with a steamer rack on high. When it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium high and place the artichoke halves, cut side down on the steam rack.\nCover. Steam for 20 minutes (less or more, depending on the size of the artichokes), until you can easily pull off the outer leaves, and you can pierce the heart easily with a knife.\nThe artichokes can be just a tiny bit less cooked than would be typically perfect for steamed artichokes, as you will be cooking them further on the grill.\n4 Grill the artichokes: Prepare your grill for direct, high heat. Use a pastry brush to brush the artichoke all over with the herb infused oil. Sprinkle all over with salt.\nPlace the artichoke halves cut-side-down on the grill grates. Cover, and grill for 5 to 10 minutes, until you have nice grill mark on the cut sides of the artichokes.\nTo serve, sprinkle the cut sides with more lemon juice. Serve alone or with mayonnaise, remoulade, or aioli.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

Remove from oven and place in a clean dish towel, rub to remove the outer skins.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 (8-ounce, 225 g) round of brie (we recommend President brand, it melts well)\n1/4 cup toasted hazelnuts (skins removed), lightly chopped\n1/2 cup (120 ml) sherry vinegar or apple cider vinegar\n5 Tbsp honey\nPinch of salt\n1 small sprig rosemary\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the sauce: Place the vinegar, honey, salt, and 5 or 6 needles from the rosemary sprig into a small saucepan. Stir to combine. Heat on medium high heat until simmering. Then lower the heat to low and simmer until the mixture starts to darken in color and the consistency thickens to a thin syrup, about 5 to 10 minutes. (Note if you find that you have over-reduced the sauce, resulting in hard candy not syrup, you can add water to it and heat it again.)\nRemove from heat and stir in the hazelnuts.\n2 Bake the brie: While the sauce is simmering, start on the brie. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C). Use a serrated knife to slice off the very top of the brie round, exposing the cheese on one side. Place on a parchment paper or Silpat lined baking sheet (cut side up). Bake until just soft and bubbly, about 15 minutes. (Jiggle the pan to see if the cheese has melted all the way through.)\n3 Drizzle the brie with sauce: Remove the brie from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two. Use a metal spatula (or two) to carefully transfer it to a serving dish. Drizzle the honey vinegar hazelnut sauce over the brie. Garnish with the sprig of rosemary.\nServe with sliced tart apples.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b"Save It Print\nTempura Fried Calamari Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hour, 15 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Serves 4-6 as an appetizer\nThe squid rings cut from the body are easier to fry than the tentacles, which tend to clump. If you have both, fry the rings first, then the tentacles.\nDo not double the recipe. The batter needs to be kept cold and used immediately after making. So it's better to work with small batches.\nIf you want to make more, mix a second batch together after you've gone through the first batch.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound cleaned squid\n1 egg yolk\n1 cup ice cold sparkling water (the colder the better)\n1/8 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/4 cup cornstarch\n3/4 cup rice or regular flour plus more for sprinkling on squid\nPeanut oil or canola oil for frying\nSpecial equipment:\nA deep fryer\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Slice the squid tubes into rings: Slice the squid tubes into rings about 1/2-inch to 3/4-inch wide. Leave the tentacles whole.\n2 Heat oil in a deep fryer or large heavy pot: This recipe was designed for a deep-fryer, but you can also fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot (keep a lid nearby, for safety reasons) halfway with oil, about 3 inches deep. Heat the oil to 360-370\xc2\xb0F.\n3 Mix dry ingredients: While the oil is heating, mix all the dry ingredients together well.\n4 Mix sparkling water with egg yolk, then mix with dry ingredients: Once the oil has reached 360\xc2\xb0F, take the sparkling water out of the refrigerator and mix it with the egg yolk. Immediately mix it in with the dry ingredients.\nMix quickly. Do not worry if there are clumps or lumps. Over-mixing may cause the batter to become chewy when cooked.\n5 Sprinkle squid pieces with flour. Use a small sieve to lightly dust the squid pieces with rice flour or regular flour. This will help the batter adhere to the squid.\n6 Dip squid pieces in batter and fry in hot oil: Working in small batches at a time (about 6 pieces), dip the squid pieces in the batter. Pick them up one by one and gently put them in the hot oil. (Note if your fingers are coated with the batter, it will help protect them from splatter.)\nWhen the squid pieces are in the oil, use a chopstick or the handle of a wooden spoon to dislodge any squid pieces that may have become stuck from the bottom of the pot or fryer. Fry for 45 seconds to 1 minute, and remove to paper towels to drain.\nNote that when done, they will NOT be golden brown, but more of a pale yellow or tan.\nRepeat with the rest of the squid. Working in batches will help keep the oil temperature from falling too far while you are frying the squid.\n6 Serve immediately: Serve immediately with lime or lemon wedges, soy sauce, ponzu sauce, Tabasco or another hot sauce.\nOnce the cooking oil has completely cooled (after about 2 hours), strain it through a paper towel-lined sieve, and save it to reuse the next time you want to deep fry seafood.\nHello!

Let sit for 10 minutes. Then drain out the juice.\n2 Cook the shrimp: Heat a couple teaspoons of olive oil in a relatively stick-free skillet (a cast iron skillet works well for this) on medium high heat.\nAdd the shrimp and cook for half a minute on each side, and remove to a bowl.\nThe shrimp shouldn't be completely cooked through; they will continue to cook during the next step.\n3 Heat the tortillas: Wipe out the skillet with paper towels. Add a small amount of olive oil (about 1/2 a teaspoon, you could use butter as well) and heat the pan on medium high.\nPlace one flour tortilla on the skillet. Flip the tortilla over a few times, 10 seconds between flips. Air pockets should begin to form within the tortilla.\nRemove the tortilla and repeat with the second tortilla. Leave the second tortilla in the pan and reduce the heat to medium.\n4 Build the quesadilla: Sprinkle the tortilla with the grated cheese. Distribute the shrimp on top of the cheese. Add chopped onion and cilantro. Place the other tortilla on top.\nFlip the quesadilla over when the bottom tortilla is nicely toasted and the cheese has begun to melt. Remove the quesadilla from the pan when the now bottom tortilla has toasted sufficiently.\nYou can also use just one tortilla instead of two, and fold the tortilla over itself like an omelette.\n5 Cut the quesadilla into triangles: Cut like a pie into six pieces (a pizza wheel works well for this). Place on a serving plate. Serve with avocado slices and sour cream. Garnish with chopped fresh cilantro. Squeeze a little lime juice over everything.\nHello!

Then de-seed them and cut them into strips.\nINGREDIENTS\nOne large, burrito-size (13-inch diameter or larger) flour tortilla\n1 Tbsp butter\n1/2 cup of grated cheddar cheese\n1 or 2 roasted green chiles, peeled, seeded, cut into strips (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat your oven to 350\xc2\xb0F with a rack in the middle.\n2 Butter a flour tortilla all the way to the edges: Place the flour tortilla on a large baking sheet (a dark baking sheet or cookie sheet will work best. Spread the butter all over the top of the tortilla, all the way to the edges. The butter is important for the flavor of a cheese crisp, so don't leave it out!\n3 Bake the tortilla until lightly toasted: Bake the plain buttered tortilla for about 6 minutes or until it begins to get lightly toasted. (Check on the timing for your particular oven.)\n4 Sprinkle with cheese, add green chile strips, return to oven: Remove the tortilla from the oven and sprinkle with the cheddar cheese, leaving about 1/2-inch from the edges. Add strips of green chiles in a star pattern if you want.\nReturn the tortilla to the oven and cook for 2 more minutes, or until all of the cheese has melted.

Stir in enough water to get a creamy, easily dip-able consistency, about 1/4 of a cup.\nThe taste of refried beans is greatly enhanced by bacon fat; we'll add a teaspoon to canned beans or a tablespoon or more to taste if we are making the beans from scratch.\nIf you don't have bacon fat, you can cook up a strip of bacon, chop it up fine and add that to the beans.\nIf you are trying to avoid pork, note that most canned refried beans are made with added lard, so check the ingredients. You can use olive oil instead, to help the consistency of the beans.\nMix in the chipotle chili powder (or Tabasco, or adobo, or regular chili powder) and cumin to taste. Note that the avocados and the sour cream will cool down the spiciness of the beans considerably, so you can afford to be a bit more spicy than you might think.\nStir in salt to taste, depending on how salted your refried beans are to begin with, and depending on how salty the tortilla chips are that you are serving with the dip.\n2 Spread on serving dish, top with cheese: Once the beans are hot and bubbly, spread them over the bottom of a warmed serving dish. Immediately add the shredded cheese so that the heat from the beans helps melt the cheese.\n(The cheese doesn't need to be completely melted, but even if it is just a little, it will help the dip stay on the chip.)\n3 Layer on toppings: Layer on the chopped green chilies, chopped avocado, chopped tomato. Spoon on the sour cream (or crema Mexicana, crema fresca, or even cream fraiche).\nTop with sliced green onions and olives.\nServe immediately with tortilla chips.\nHello!

Don\xe2\x80\x99t worry if the dough has not formed completely yet.\n2 Knead the dough: Using your hands, knead all the bits of dough together inside the bowl. If your dough is still very dry, add a splash of hot water, about 1 to 2 tablespoons, until it comes together and all the flour is absorbed.\nContinue kneading the dough for about 2 more minutes. The dough will feel moist but it should not stick to your hands too much.\n3 Rest the dough: Shape the dough into a round ball. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let the dough rest for 30 minutes.\n4 Roll out the pancakes: Sprinkle flour on top of a work surface. Divide the dough into 4 pieces of equal size. Work with one piece at a time, leaving the remaining pieces in the bowl.\nShape piece of dough into a small ball. Use a rolling pin to roll out the dough into a thin circle, about 7 to 8 inches in diameter.\n5 Add the scallions: Brush a thin layer of canola oil on top of the dough, making sure not to miss the edges. Sprinkle sliced scallions all over the dough.\n6 Roll and flatten the pancake: Starting on one end, roll the circle of dough into a log. Take one end of the rolled up dough and curl it toward the center, like a snail's shell. Tuck the end of the dough underneath the spiral.\nUse the palm of your hand to flatten the dough into a thick circle. Roll it out again with your rolling pin. Try to roll it out as thinly as possible. A few slices of scallions may pop out during the process, and that\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly normal.\nTransfer rolled out scallion pancake to a plate. Repeat steps 4 through 6 with the remaining dough pieces.\n7 Cook the pancakes: Heat about 2 teaspoons of canola oil a small nonstick or cast iron skillet over medium heat.\nPlace one of the pancakes in the middle of the pan and pan fry each side for about 2 to 3 minutes, until they\xe2\x80\x99re golden brown. Transfer to a plate and repeat with the 3 remaining scallion pancakes, adding more oil to the pan as needed.\n8 Prepare the dipping sauce: Mix all the sauce ingredients in a small bowl. Adjust the seasonings to your liking, adding more soy sauce or vinegar, if you like. Add any leftover scallions to the dipping sauce, and add a pinch of red pepper flakes if you would like a bit of spice.\n9 Serve the hot pancakes: Cut the scallion pancakes into small wedges and serve while hot, with the dipping sauce. (The pancakes are still good when cooled, but will no longer be crispy.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Note that one long side of the pork loin roast will be thicker, and one side thinner.\nUsing a sharp knife, make a long cut an inch or so from the edge from the thinner long side of the roast at about a 45\xc2\xb0 degree angle, stopping a half inch from reaching the bottom of the roast.\nThen angle the knife so that it is flat, parallel to the cutting board, and make slow, shallow cuts into the roast, along the same line.\nAs you cut, you can open up the top part of the roast like a book. Keep making slow, even cuts until you have "rolled" the roast out completely.\n3 Pound the butterflied roast to an even thickness: With the pork roast unfolded, cover with 2 layers of of plastic wrap.\nPound with a meat mallet to flatten to a somewhat even thickness. Remove plastic wrap. Sprinkle the pork with salt and pepper and set aside.\n4 Make the filling: Place the panko and stock in a small bowl and stir to combine.\nStir in the apples, walnuts, cranberries, shallots, maple syrup and rosemary.\n5 Roll up pork roast with filling: Spread the filling over surface of the pork, leaving an inch margin around all sides except for the fat layer side\xe2\x80\x94with that side leave a 2-inch margin.\nStarting with the end of the roast rectangle that does not have the fat layer on the bottom, roll up the roast.\n6 Secure with kitchen string. Tie the roast in 1 to 2 inch intervals with cotton kitchen string.\nAt this point you can wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate if you are making ahead.\n7 Bake: Coat the bottom of a roasting pan with cooking spray or a little olive oil. Place the roast in the pan and cook at 450\xc2\xb0F for 15 minutes to brown the top, then reduce the oven temperature to 325\xc2\xb0F. Cook uncovered, for about 30 to 40 minutes, or until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 140\xc2\xb0F.\n8 Rest and serve: Tent the roast with foil and let it rest for 10 minutes. Remove the kitchen string and slice into 1/2-inch thick slices to serve.\nSave the pan drippings! Serve with pan drippings or use the pan drippings to make gravy. See How to Make Gravy.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHomemade Apple Pie Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hour, 15 minutesCook time: 55 minutesYield: Serves 8\nIf the crust looks like it's getting too browned, take a large piece of aluminum foil and place on top of the pie in the oven. No need to wrap it around the pie, just place it on top. That will keep the top from browning further.\nPies always seem to take longer to cook than one expects. (Perhaps it's because we're always opening the oven to check on how the pie is doing?) The filling should be visibly bubbling, which you should be able to see through the steam vents.\nI recommend putting a rimmed baking sheet on a rack beneath the rack of the pie to catch the filling as some of it invariably bubbles up and out over the pie. Makes oven clean-up a lot easier.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 pounds good cooking apples such as Granny Smith, Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Fuji, or Braeburn (about 6 to 8 apples, depending on the size of your apples and the size of your pie dish)\n1 tablespoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (to toss with the sliced apples so they don't brown as you slice them)\n1/2 cup to 2/3 cup sugar, depending on how sweet you like your pie\n3 tablespoons all-purpose flour for thickening\n1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1 tablespoon brandy (Optional. By the way, if you have Calvados apple brandy, use it!)\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 recipe double crust sour cream pie dough, OR all-butter crust, OR your favorite pie crust recipe\nFor the egg wash:\n1 large egg yolk\n1 tablespoon cream\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Peel, core, and slice the apples: Peel, core and slice or roughly chop the apples into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices or chunks.\nAs you cut your apple slices, add them to a large bowl and sprinkle them with a little lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to help keep them from turning brown.\n2 Make the apple pie filling: Combine sugar, flour and spices (allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon) in a bowl. Add the flour mixture to the apple slices and use your hands to distribute the flour through the apples so they are well coated.\nThen sprinkle with brandy and vanilla extract and stir to coat all the apples.\n3 Prepare oven: Place one oven rack in the lowest position and put a large rimmed baking sheet on it (to catch any drippings from the pie.) Position a second rack the next rung up (still in the lower third of the oven) and preheat to 375\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Roll out the dough and line bottom pie plate: Remove one disk of pie dough from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. Place disk on a lightly floured, clean, flat surface. Using a rolling pin, roll out the pie dough to a 12-inch circle, about 1/8 of an inch thick.\nAs you roll out the dough, check to make sure it isn't sticking. If and when it starts to stick, gently lift it up and sprinkle a little more flour on the table surface or on the pie dough to keep the dough from sticking.\nGently place the rolled out dough onto a 9-inch pie plate. Press down to line the pie dish with the dough.\n5 Place apple slices on top of the bottom crust: Arrange the apple slices in the dough-lined pie plate. Mound the apples in the center.\n6 Roll out top crust, place over apples, trim and crimp edges: Roll out the second disk of dough, again to 12-inches. Gently place the second round of pie dough over the apples. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang from the edges of the pie pan.\nFold the dough under itself so that the edge of the fold comes right to the edge of the pan. Press the top and bottom dough rounds together as you flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork.\n7 Brush with egg wash, cut vents: Place egg yolk and cream in a small bowl and use a fork to stir until well combined. Use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash over the top and fluted edges of the pie. Use a sharp knife to cut slits in the top of the pie crust for steam vents.\n8 Bake: Place pie on oven rack centered over the baking sheet on the rack below it to catch any drippings. Bake the pie at 375\xc2\xb0F until crust begins to lightly brown, about 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350\xc2\xb0F.\nBake until crust is golden and juices are bubbling, anywhere from an additional 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the type of apples you are using. (About halfway through baking check to make sure the pie isn't browning too much. When it's nicely browned, tent the pie with a large piece of aluminum foil to keep the pie from browning further.)\n9 Let cool: Transfer the apple pie to a rack to cool for at least 1 hour. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. Great with a side of vanilla ice cream.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Dot with butter.\n6 Roll out top crust, place over apples, trim and crimp edges: Roll out second disk of dough, as before. Gently turn over onto the top of the apples in the pie. Pinch top and bottom of dough rounds firmly together. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang.\nFold the dough under itself so that the edge of the fold is flush with the edge of the pan. Flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork.\n7 Score the top, brush with egg wash: Score the top of the pie with four 2-inch long cuts, so that steam from the cooking pie can escape. Beat egg yolk with cream and brush on the surface of the pie with a pastry brush.\n7 Bake: Set pie on preheated baking sheet (to catch any juices that may escape from the pie while cooking). Bake at 425\xc2\xb0F for 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 375\xc2\xb0F and cook for an additional 50 to 60 minutes or more, until filling bubbles in the center and crust turns golden brown.\n8 Cool: Cool on a wire rack for 1 1/2 hours.

b"Save It Print\nSlow Cooker Cider Pulled Pork Recipe\nPrep time: 30 minutesCook time: 25 minutesSlow cooker time: 8 hoursYield: 10 to 12 servings\nThe meat will release liquid as it cooks. A 6-quart slow cooker for 6 pounds of meat works well. If you want to double the recipe, it's best to borrow a neighbor's slow cooker so you can have two going at once.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99d like, the pork can be served as soon as it finishes slow-cooking. Remove the pork from the liquid and transfer the liquid to a measuring cup. Shred the pork and then keep it warm in the slow cooker or on a covered baking sheet in a low oven. Use 2 cups of the cooking liquid to make the sauce. Serve immediately.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the rub:\n2 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar, packed\n2 1/2 tablespoons Kosher salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice (or 1 teaspoon cinnamon, 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger, 1/4 teaspoon ground cloves, and a dash of nutmeg)\n1 1/2 teaspoons chili powder\n1 1/2 teaspoons freshly ground black pepper\n1 teaspoon ground dry mustard\n1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper\nFor the pork:\n6 pound boneless pork shoulder, trimmed of excess fat\n1 (12-ounce) bottle hard apple cider\n2 cups apple cider\nFor the sauce:\n2 tablespoons tomato paste\n3 garlic cloves\n3/4 cup ketchup\n1/2 cup brown mustard\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n1/4 cup apple cider vinegar\n1/4 cup Worcestershire sauce\n2 teaspoons liquid smoke\n3/4 teaspoon Kosher salt\n2 cups pork stock leftover from braising\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart slow cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the rub and prep the pork: In a small bowl, combine all of the ingredients for the rub. Trim your pork shoulder of excess exterior fat. Massage the rub into the meat.\n2 Slow cook the pork: Place the pork in a 6-quart slow cooker. Pour in both ciders. The liquid should come about 3/4 of the way up the side of the meat; the meat should not be completely submerged.\nCover with the lid, and set slow cooker to low heat for at least 8 hours.\n3 Cool the pork and refrigerate overnight: Let the pork with the cooking liquid cool completely while still in the slow cooker insert on the counter. Transfer the pork to a cutting board and pour the cooking liquid into a separate storage container.\nTransfer the pork back to the slow cooker insert and cover. Refrigerate the pork and the cooking liquid overnight or up to three days. (Refrigerating the pork whole, rather than shredded, helps keep it moist and prevents it from drying out too much until you're ready to serve.)\n4 Shred the pork: When ready to serve the pork, remove it and the cooking liquid from the refrigerator. Scrape any solidified fat from the outside of the pork and the surface of the cooking liquid.\nUsing your fingers or two forks, shred the pork. You can do this right in the slow cooker, on a sheet pan, or on a cutting board. Pick out and discard any large pieces of fat as you go.\n5 Warm the pork: Warm the shredded pork in the slow cooker on the Low or Warm setting while you prepare the sauce. If the pork seems dry at any point, stir in a few tablespoons of the leftover cooking liquid.\nAlternatively, you can warm the pork on a sheet pan covered with foil in a low oven.\n6 Make the sauce: Measure out two cups of the leftover cooking liquid. The remainder can be strained and saved for another purpose, or frozen for up to three months.\nIn a medium saucepan over medium heat, add the tomato paste and garlic. Whisk together and cook for about 1 minute until fragrant. Whisk in the remaining ingredients, finishing with the reserved 2 cups of cooking liquid.\nIncrease heat to medium high and bring to a gentle boil. Reduce the sauce, whisking occasionally until it has the viscosity of thick tomato soup, but not as thick as ketchup, about 15 minutes. Taste and adjust the seasoning as you wish.\n7 Serve the pork: Reserve about 1/2 cup of sauce to serve in a small bowl alongside the pork. Pour the rest of the sauce over the pork, toss to combine, and serve it to the masses.\nPlace a pile of pork on top of buttered, toasted buns, top with pickles, pickled onions, or extra sauce, and dig in.\nHello!

You will let the donut holes dry here after you\xe2\x80\x99ve dipped them in the glaze.\n2 Make the batter: In a large mixing bowl whisk together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.\nIn medium bowl, whisk together the egg, sour cream, and apple cider.\nAdd the wet mixture to the dry mixture, followed by the melted butter, and fold to combine until you get a very thick batter.\n3 Prepare to fry the donut holes: Heat the oil in a 3-quart saucepan until the temperature reads 350\xc2\xb0F. Use a medium cookie scoop (about 1 1/2 tablespoons), to scoop up the batter. Fry the donut holes in batches, cooking each side for about 2 minutes, until the donut holes float to the surface and turn golden brown. Drain on paper towels. Repeat until all the batter is used up.\n4 Make the glaze: In a medium bowl whisk the powdered sugar with 2 tablespoons of apple cider and pinch of salt, adding more cider a few teaspoons at a time, until you get a thick, heavy glaze. You may not need all 4 tablespoons of cider. Remember that the glaze will thin as it hits the hot warm donuts.\n5 Dip the donut holes: Pour the glaze into a deep bowl or mug, this will help with glazing the donuts. Dip the warm (or even hot) donuts into the glaze, using a spoon to coat the donut hole completely.\nLift the donut hole from the glaze using a fork. Let the glaze set and drain by placing the dipped donut holes on the wire rack set over a baking sheet. Enjoy immediately!\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Print\nApple Cider Chicken Thighs Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 50 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n4 or 5 bone-in skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 pounds)\n2 medium sweet potatoes, diced (about 2 cups diced)\n1/2 white onion, sliced thin\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper\n1 cup apple cider\n1/2 cup chicken stock\n1 tablespoon fresh rosemary\nCooked rice or orzo for serving (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\nLarge cast iron skillet\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 350\xcb\x9aF.\n2 Sear the chicken thighs: Season the chicken thighs on both sides with kosher salt and pepper. Add chicken thighs skin-side down to a large, cold cast iron skillet. Place the skillet over medium heat and let the thighs cook, untouched, for 15 minutes, until the skin is deeply golden and crispy.\n3 Add the remaining ingredients: After the chicken thighs have cooked for 15 minutes, carefully flip them. Add the sweet potatoes, onion, apple cider, chicken stock, and fresh rosemary to the skillet. Stir gently to make sure ingredients are distributed evenly. The thighs should only be submerged halfway in the liquid so the skin stays crispy while baking.\n4 Cook the chicken thighs in the oven: Transfer the skillet to the oven and cook for 30-35 minutes, or until sweet potatoes are fork-tender and the chicken is cooked through. (It should reach at least 165\xcb\x9aF in the thickest part.) It\xe2\x80\x99s very hard to overcook chicken thighs in this environment, so don\xe2\x80\x99t worry if they register much hotter than that.\n5 Serve the chicken thighs: Divide the chicken thighs between four plates and add cooked rice or orzo to the side, which is great for soaking up the juices. Spoon sweet potatoes and onions on top.\nLeftovers will keep in the fridge for 4-5 days. To reheat, microwave the thighs for about 90 seconds on high. To regain some of the crispiness, reheat the thighs in the oven until warmed through.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nHomemade Apple Pie Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hour, 15 minutesCook time: 55 minutesYield: Serves 8\nIf the crust looks like it's getting too browned, take a large piece of aluminum foil and place on top of the pie in the oven. No need to wrap it around the pie, just place it on top. That will keep the top from browning further.\nPies always seem to take longer to cook than one expects. (Perhaps it's because we're always opening the oven to check on how the pie is doing?) The filling should be visibly bubbling, which you should be able to see through the steam vents.\nI recommend putting a rimmed baking sheet on a rack beneath the rack of the pie to catch the filling as some of it invariably bubbles up and out over the pie. Makes oven clean-up a lot easier.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 pounds good cooking apples such as Granny Smith, Jonagold, Golden Delicious, Fuji, or Braeburn (about 6 to 8 apples, depending on the size of your apples and the size of your pie dish)\n1 tablespoon lemon juice or apple cider vinegar (to toss with the sliced apples so they don't brown as you slice them)\n1/2 cup to 2/3 cup sugar, depending on how sweet you like your pie\n3 tablespoons all-purpose flour for thickening\n1/2 teaspoon cinnamon\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\n1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg\n1 tablespoon brandy (Optional. By the way, if you have Calvados apple brandy, use it!)\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 recipe double crust sour cream pie dough, OR all-butter crust, OR your favorite pie crust recipe\nFor the egg wash:\n1 large egg yolk\n1 tablespoon cream\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Peel, core, and slice the apples: Peel, core and slice or roughly chop the apples into 1/4-inch to 1/2-inch slices or chunks.\nAs you cut your apple slices, add them to a large bowl and sprinkle them with a little lemon juice or apple cider vinegar to help keep them from turning brown.\n2 Make the apple pie filling: Combine sugar, flour and spices (allspice, nutmeg, cinnamon) in a bowl. Add the flour mixture to the apple slices and use your hands to distribute the flour through the apples so they are well coated.\nThen sprinkle with brandy and vanilla extract and stir to coat all the apples.\n3 Prepare oven: Place one oven rack in the lowest position and put a large rimmed baking sheet on it (to catch any drippings from the pie.) Position a second rack the next rung up (still in the lower third of the oven) and preheat to 375\xc2\xb0F.\n4 Roll out the dough and line bottom pie plate: Remove one disk of pie dough from the refrigerator. Let sit at room temperature for 5-10 minutes. Place disk on a lightly floured, clean, flat surface. Using a rolling pin, roll out the pie dough to a 12-inch circle, about 1/8 of an inch thick.\nAs you roll out the dough, check to make sure it isn't sticking. If and when it starts to stick, gently lift it up and sprinkle a little more flour on the table surface or on the pie dough to keep the dough from sticking.\nGently place the rolled out dough onto a 9-inch pie plate. Press down to line the pie dish with the dough.\n5 Place apple slices on top of the bottom crust: Arrange the apple slices in the dough-lined pie plate. Mound the apples in the center.\n6 Roll out top crust, place over apples, trim and crimp edges: Roll out the second disk of dough, again to 12-inches. Gently place the second round of pie dough over the apples. Trim excess dough with kitchen shears, leaving a 3/4 inch overhang from the edges of the pie pan.\nFold the dough under itself so that the edge of the fold comes right to the edge of the pan. Press the top and bottom dough rounds together as you flute edges using thumb and forefinger or press with a fork.\n7 Brush with egg wash, cut vents: Place egg yolk and cream in a small bowl and use a fork to stir until well combined. Use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash over the top and fluted edges of the pie. Use a sharp knife to cut slits in the top of the pie crust for steam vents.\n8 Bake: Place pie on oven rack centered over the baking sheet on the rack below it to catch any drippings. Bake the pie at 375\xc2\xb0F until crust begins to lightly brown, about 20 minutes, then reduce heat to 350\xc2\xb0F.\nBake until crust is golden and juices are bubbling, anywhere from an additional 45 minutes to an hour, depending on the type of apples you are using. (About halfway through baking check to make sure the pie isn't browning too much. When it's nicely browned, tent the pie with a large piece of aluminum foil to keep the pie from browning further.)\n9 Let cool: Transfer the apple pie to a rack to cool for at least 1 hour. Serve slightly warm or at room temperature. Great with a side of vanilla ice cream.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Chill until needed in the recipe.\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the streusel topping: Place the streusel topping ingredients in a medium bowl and mix with a fork or your hands until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs.\nChill in the refrigerator until the topping is needed half-way through the baking.\n2 Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F with a rack in the middle and another rack below it. Place a large rimmed baking sheet on the lower rack to catch any of the drippings from the pie.\n3 Mix sour cream with sugar, flour, salt, vanilla, egg, and coat apple slices with it: In a large bowl put the sour cream, sugar, flour, salt, vanilla, and egg. Use a wooden spoon and beat by hand until smooth. Fold in the apples and stir until all of the apples are coated with the sour cream filling mixture.\n4 Put the filling into a frozen pie shell. For the first stage of baking, bake the pie for 25 minutes at 400\xc2\xb0F.\n5 After the first 25 minutes, remove the pie from the oven and sprinkle the top with the brown sugar butter flour topping mixture.

b"Save It Print\nGluten-Free Apple Tart Recipe\nPrep time: 45 minutesCook time: 45 minutesChill time: 1 hourYield: 8 to 10\nMaple sugar is a granulated sugar made from dehydrated maple syrup. You can find it on Amazon or in many Whole Foods Stores. Coconut sugar is becoming more widely available. It is a fine substitute, but it will make the tart a much darker shade of golden than the maple sugar.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the paleo pie crust:\n2 cups finely ground almond flour (I used Bob\xe2\x80\x99s Red Mill Superfine Almond Flour)\n1 cup arrowroot starch\n2 tablespoons maple sugar (or 3 tablespoons coconut sugar)\n1 1/2 tablespoons ground chia seeds (I used white chia seeds)\n1/2 tablespoon ground flax (I used golden flax seeds)\n2 teaspoons baking powder\n1/4 teaspoon salt\n4 tablespoons cold unsalted butter, ghee, lard, duck fat, refined coconut oil, or sustainable palm shortening\n1 large egg\n1 egg yolk\n3 to 6 tablespoons ice water\nExtra arrowroot or tapioca starch for shaping and rolling\nFor the apple filling:\n6 medium baking apples (I like a mix of Granny Smiths and Honeycrisp)\n2 tablespoons unsalted butter, ghee, refined coconut oil, or palm shortening\n2 tablespoons maple sugar (or three tablespoons coconut sugar)\n2 tablespoons lemon juice\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract (optional)\nZest of one lemon\nSpecial equipment:\nFood processor\n9-inch tart pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the pie crust: Combine the almond flour, arrowroot, maple sugar, chia, flax, baking powder, and salt to the bowl of a food processor and pulse 5 to 6 times to combine. Add the butter and pulse another 4 to 5 times until the mixture starts to look like sandy, pea-sized gravel. Add the egg and egg yolk, then sprinkle 3 tablespoons water evenly over the top of the dough. Pulse a few times until the mixture just starts to clump together and form a ball.\n2 Chill the crust: Turn the pastry dough out onto a cutting board and use your hands to shape it into a chubby disk. Wrap tightly in plastic and refrigerate for at least one hour or up to three days.\n3 Roll out the crust: When ready to bake the tart, lay a sheet of parchment on your counter or other flat surface and sprinkle with arrowroot or tapioca starch. Place the chilled pie dough in the center of the parchment and roll into a circle about 12 inches in diameter.\n4 Transfer the crust to the tart pan: Flip your tart pan upside down and place it in the center of the rolled out pastry dough. There should be at least 1 1/2 inches of pie dough showing around the edge. Carefully, slide one hand palm side up under the parchment and place the other hand on the tart pan. Quickly, and with great confidence, flip the whole thing over.\nGently ease the crust into the tart dish and press it into the corners. Peel back the parchment and discard. Your pastry dough may break, but just press the cracks back together if it does. Use a paring knife to trim away the excess dough and then prick the bottom of the tart all over with the tines of a fork.\n5 Place the tart shell in the freezer to chill while you prepare the apples.\n6 Preheat oven to 350F.\n7 Prepare the apples. Peel the apples and halve them lengthwise. Use a melon baller, paring knife, or small spoon to remove the core, seeds, and stem. Slice the apples very thinly (ideally 1/8-inch thick) using a chef's knife or mandoline.\n8 Prepare the glaze: In a small saucepan, melt butter (or other fat) with the sugar, lemon juice, and vanilla over medium heat. Whisk to combine while bringing to a simmer. Keep whisking until all sugar is dissolved.\n9 Assemble the tart: Find a few of your thinnest apple slices and set them aside. Remove the tart shell from the freezer and begin laying the apple slices in concentric circles, starting from the outer edge of the crust and spiraling inward.\nWhen you get to the center, take your thinnest apple slices and fold them gently to form the center of the pattern. (You might have some apple slices leftover.)\nSprinkle the lemon zest evenly over the tart. Drizzle about half of the glaze evenly over the tart. (I dipped a pastry brush in the glaze and let it drip onto onto the apples.)\n10 Bake the tart for 40 minutes, turning the pan halfway through baking.\n11 Brush the rest of the glaze over the apple slices. Return to the oven and bake for 5 more minutes.\n12 Serve warm or at room temperature.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nNew England Apple Cheddar Galette Recipe\nPrep time: 40 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: Makes 8 servings\nIf using a tart apple such as a Granny Smith, you may want to add a little sugar or more maple syrup to the filling to balance the tartness of the apple.\nINGREDIENTS\nCrust:\n1 1/2 cups (200g) of all purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1 1/2 teaspoons sugar\n1 1/2 sticks (3/4 cups, 6 ounces, 170 g) unsalted butter\n1/4 cup plus 2 Tbsp (85 ml) sour cream (full fat, not light)\n2 Tbsp finely grated sharp cheddar cheese\nFilling:\n4 good cooking apples, such as McIntosh, Courtland, Jonagold, Pippin, Golden Delicious, Jonathan, Fuji, or a mixture of various cooking apples (NOT red delicious)\n1/2 teaspoon lemon zest\n1 half of a lemon, or the juice of half a lemon (to acidulate the water for holding the apples while you peel them to keep them from discoloring)\n1 Tbsp maple syrup\n2 teaspoons minute tapioca or instant tapioca for thickener (can substitute corn starch)\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/2 cup lightly packed grated cheddar cheese\nFinishing:\n1 egg for egg wash\nCoarse sugar for sprinkling on the crust\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nMake the pastry dough\n1 Cut the butter into cubes. In a large bowl whisk together the flour, salt, and sugar. Sprinkle the butter cubes over the flour.\n2 Use your clean hands to squish the flour and butter together, breaking up the butter into smaller pieces until the mixture resembles a rather shaggy coarse meal with a few pea-sized pieces of butter. Add the sour cream and a couple tablespoons of finely grated sharp cheddar cheese and stir with a fork until incorporated.\n3 Gather the mixture with your hands and form a ball. Shape the ball into a disk. Sprinkle with a little flour, wrap in plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes and up to a day ahead.\n  Prepare the galette\n1 Peel, core, quarter the apples, place in water with lemon juice: Preheat oven to 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C). Prepare a large bowl half filled with water. Squeeze into it the juice of half a lemon (and put the squeezed lemon in too if you want). Peel, quarter, and core the apples, and place into the acidulated water while you work to keep the apples from discoloring.\n2 Slice the apple quarters: Remove the apple quarters from the water. Slice each apple quarter into 4 or 5 slices, lengthwise, about 1/4 inch to 3/8 inch thick at the widest end. Return the apple slices to the acidulated water.\n3 Drain apple slices, sprinkle with maple syrup, cinnamon, minute tapioca, zest: Drain the apple slices. Place the apple slices back in the now empty bowl. Sprinkle with maple syrup and cinnamon and gently toss so that the apple slices are lightly coated with both. Add the minute tapioca and the lemon zest. Gently toss again.\n4 Roll out the dough, transfer to lined baking sheet: On a clean, lightly floured, flat surface, place the disk of dough. Roll out with a rolling pin to an even thickness and about 14 inches wide. Gently move the rolled out pastry dough to a parchment lined baking sheet.\n5 Arrange apple slices on the dough: Starting from 2 inches from the perimeter of the pastry round, arrange the apple slices, side by side, in a circular pattern, filling the circle. It's okay if some of the apple slices overlap a little.\n6 Sprinkle with cheese, fold edges over in pleats: Sprinkle the top of the apples with grated cheddar cheese. Gently fold the dough up over the apple slices, forming pleats with the dough every few inches.\n7 Brush with egg wash, sprinkle with coarse sugar: Place an egg in a small bowl with a teaspoon of water, beat with a fork or whisk until smooth. Use a pastry brush to brush the egg wash over the exposed border of the dough (don't put on the apples, just the dough). Sprinkle the egg washed crust with coarse sugar.\n8 Bake: Bake for 10 to 15 minutes (until beginning to brown) at 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C). Then lower the temperature to 375\xc2\xb0F (190\xc2\xb0C) and bake for 15 to 20 minutes more, until the apples are cooked through and the crust is nicely browned.\nCool until just lightly warm before serving.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHow to Make Fruit Leather\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 9 hoursYield: 4 cups of fruit yield about one baking sheet of fruit leather.\nINGREDIENTS\nFresh fruit (apricots, peaches, plums, berries, apples, pears, grapes)\nWater\nLemon juice\nSugar (if needed)\nSpices such as cinnamon and nutmeg (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Rinse, taste, and prep the fruit: Rinse the fruit. If you working with stone fruit, take out the pits, chop the fruit. If working with apples or pears, peel and core them, then chop. If working with grapes, de-stem them.\nTaste the fruit before proceeding. Note how sweet the fruit is. If very sweet (ripe Concord grapes for example) you will not need to add any sugar. If still a little tart, you may need to add some sugar in the next step.\n2 Cook fruit with water, sugar, lemon juice, spices: Place fruit in a large saucepan. Add a half cup of water for every 4 cups of chopped fruit.\nBring to a simmer, cover and let cook on a low heat for 10-15 minutes, or until the fruit is cooked through. Uncover and stir.\nUse a potato masher to mash up the fruit in the pan.\nTaste the fruit and determine what and how much sugar, lemon juice, or spices to add.\nAdd sugar in small amounts (1 Tbsp at a time if working with 4 cups of fruit), to desired level of sweetness.\nAdd lemon juice one teaspoon at a time to help brighten the flavor of the fruit. Add a pinch or two of cinnamon, nutmeg, or other spices to augment the flavor.\nContinue to simmer and stir until any added sugar is completely dissolved and the fruit pur\xc3\xa9e has thickened, another 5 or 10 minutes (or more).\nNote if you are working with grapes - strain the juice out of the mashed grapes to make grape juice. Force what is left behind, after straining, through a food mill, to make the pur\xc3\xa9e for the next step.\n3 Pur\xc3\xa9e the cooked, mashed fruit: Put the pur\xc3\xa9e through a food mill or chinoise. Alternatively pur\xc3\xa9e it thoroughly in a blender or food processor.\nTaste again and adjust sugar/lemon/spices if necessary. The pur\xc3\xa9e should be very smooth.\n4 Pour pur\xc3\xa9e into lined baking sheet: Line a rimmed baking sheet with sturdy plastic wrap (the kind that is microwave safe). Pour out the pur\xc3\xa9e into the lined baking sheet to about an 1/8 to 1/4 inch thickness.\n5 Slowly dry out in oven at a very low temp: Place the baking sheet in the oven, try to keep any plastic wrap from touch the sides of the oven or the oven racks. Also try to make sure that the plastic wrap hasn't folded back over on top of the pur\xc3\xa9e. If this happens, the pur\xc3\xa9e won't dry out.\nHeat the oven to a low 140\xc2\xb0F. If you have a convection setting, use it, it will speed up the process and help dry out the pur\xc3\xa9e. Let dry in the oven like this for as long as it takes for the pur\xc3\xa9e to dry out and form fruit leather.\nWe usually keep it in the oven overnight, so about 8-12 hours. The fruit leather is ready when it is no longer sticky, but has a smooth surface.\nAlternatives to the oven. If you have a food dehydrator, this would be a great use of it. My mother suggested putting the tray in the weber grill, and leaving covered, in the sun all day. Sounds like a good trick, but I haven't tried it yet.\nMy parents remember the traditional way of making fruit leather was just to tent the tray with some cheesecloth and leave it outside in the sun on a hot day.\n6 Roll up in its plastic wrap to store: When the fruit leather is ready, you can easily peel it up from the plastic wrap.\nTo store it, roll it in its plastic wrap, put it in an airtight container and store in the refrigerator or freezer.\nHello!

Cooking raw couscous is a much more involved process, which we do not cover here in this recipe.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/2 cup chopped red onion\n1/4 cup lemon juice\n1 10-ounce box of couscous, about 1 1/3 cups\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided\n1 teaspoon salt, plus more to taste\n1/2 cup shelled raw pistachios*\n10 dried apricots, chopped\n1/3 cup chopped parsley\nOptional 2 teaspoons harissa, prepared or homemade (see this Paula Wolfert harissa recipe)\n*If you only have access to shelled roasted pistachios, use them and skip step 2 in the method instructions.\nMETHOD\n1 Soak chopped onion in lemon juice: Place the chopped onion in a small bowl. Pour the lemon juice over the onions, set aside and let the onions soak in the lemon juice.\n2 Toast pistachios: Toast the pistachios in a small pan on medium-high heat until lightly browned and fragrant. (Take care when toasting nuts, they can burn quickly if you don't pay attention!) Remove from heat and place into a small bowl to cool.\n3 Cook the couscous: Put 2 cups of water in a medium saucepan and bring to a boil. Add one tablespoon of olive oil and one teaspoon of salt to the water. Once the salt dissolves, stir in the couscous, turn off the heat and cover the pot. Move the pot off the hot burner and let the couscous steam, covered, for 5-6 minutes.\n4 Combine ingredients to make salad: Scoop out the couscous into a large bowl and fluff with a fork. Stir in the harissa, if using. Stir in the pistachios, chopped apricots and parsley. Stir in the red onion and lemon juice. Add one more tablespoon of olive oil, stir well and add salt to taste.

b'Print\nRosemary Duck with Apricots Recipe\nPrep time: 2 hoursCook time: 10 minutesYield: Serves 4\nThis recipe will work with either domestic or wild ducks.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 Tbsp chopped fresh rosemary\n2 Tbsp brown sugar\n1 Tbsp freshly ground black pepper\n2 teaspoons salt\n2 whole duck breasts, halved\n1/2 cup granulated sugar\n1/2 cup champagne vinegar or white wine vinegar\n4 apricots, quartered\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Marinate the duck breasts: Combine the rosemary, brown sugar, black pepper, and salt. Rub the mixture over the duck breasts. Cover and chill 2 hours. Rinse duck with cold water, pat dry.\n2 Score the fatty skin with a sharp knife: If the duck breasts are very fatty, score the skin side with a sharp knife. Be careful not to cut the meat.\n3 Cook fat side down, starting with a cold pan: Lay the duck breast halves skin side down in a cold saut\xc3\xa9 pan and turn on the heat to medium-high. (Yes, start with a cold pan.) Once you hear the duck breasts sizzle, turn the heat down to medium and allow to cook undisturbed until the skin is brown and crispy, about 6-8 minutes.\n4 Turn breasts over to finish cooking: Turn the duck breast over and cook another 2-3 minutes, depending on how well done you like your duck. Use the finger test to check for doneness. As a final step, tip the duck breasts on their sides \xe2\x80\x94 thick side down \xe2\x80\x94 and let them sizzle another minute or so. Remove to a cutting board to rest.\n5 Caramelize the apricots: While the duck is cooking, combine the granulated sugar and vinegar in a small saucepan, and bring to a boil. Cook until thick and amber-colored (about 5 minutes).\nAdd apricots; reduce heat, and cook for 1 minute or until the apricots begin to soften.\n6 Serve: To serve, cut duck diagonally across the grain into slices. Serve with caramelized apricots.\nVARIATION WITH WHOLE DUCK INSTEAD OF BREASTS:\nYou can instead roast a whole duck. Here are the steps (also from Keith):\n1 Marinate the duck: Rinse off the duck, outside and inside, pat dry. Remove any remaining feathers.\nPrick the skin all over with a sharp-tined fork, taking care not to prick the meat.\nRub the duck all over with a little bit of olive oil. Rub the rosemary mixture all over the duck and some in the cavity.\nTie the legs together loosely. Put in a plastic bag and chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours.\n2 Roast the duck breast side up: At least a half an hour before you plan to cook the duck, remove from the refrigerator so it can get to room temperature. Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. Place the duck on a roasting rack in a roasting pan, breast side up. Pour a cup of water into the pan. Roast for 45 minutes. Remove the pan from the oven and pour off the fat and water. Separate the fat to use for basting.\n3 Finish roasting the duck breast side down: Turn the bird on the rack so now the breast is facing down. Baste the bird with the fat. Return the bird to the oven. Increase the temperature to 400\xc2\xb0F. Estimate a total cooking time of 15 minutes per lb of bird. So if you have a 4 lb duck, cook it another 30 minutes.\nThe bird is done when the juices run clear from a thigh pricked all the way down to the joint and when a meat thermometer inserted in the inner thigh below the leg joint reads 175 to 180 degrees. Be careful not to overcook the duck. When the bird is done, transfer it to a platter and let it rest for 15 minutes before carving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

This recipe can be easily doubled; if doubling, use an 8-quart pot.\nINGREDIENTS\n5 cups of chopped apricots, pits discarded*\n2 + 3/4 cups of sugar\n1/3 cup of Riesling (or Gew\xc3\xbcrztraminer)\n5 tablespoons of lemon juice\nMETHOD\n1 Place a couple small plates in the freezer, these will be used to test the jam later.\n2 Bring apricots, sugar, wine, lemon juice to a boil: Place the apricots, sugar, wine, and lemon juice in a large (at least 4-qt), thick-bottomed, stainless steel pot and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.\n3 Skim the foam, gently stir: The mixture will boil and rise in volume. Skim off the pale yellow foam that forms at the top and discard. The boil will subside to larger bubbles, but still bubble vigorously. Be sure to begin gently stirring the jam frequently to prevent it from sticking to the bottom.\n4 Test jam on cold plate: After about 25 minutes begin testing the jam by placing a small amount on a cold plate. Allow 30 seconds to pass and then run your finger through it to see what the cooled consistency will be. Boil for a few minutes longer if desired for a thicker jam.\n5 Ladle into jars: Ladle into hot, sterilized canning jars** and seal leaving 1/4 inch of head space. Before applying the lids, sterilize the lids by placing them in a bowl and pouring boiling water over them. Wipe the rims of the jars clean before applying the lids.\nWill keep for up to a year.\n* If you want, you can use a few of the kernels from the pits to give your jam a slight almond-y flavor. Roast the pits at 350 for about 10 minutes. Take them and crack them open with a hammer (do outside on concrete), and extract the kernel. Roast the "nuts" for a couple of minutes. Pop one or two in each sterilized jar when you pour the jam in.\n** To sterilize the jars, rinse out clean Mason jars, dry them, and place them, without lids, upright in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for 10 minutes.\nHello!

Work the butter with your fingers to smear it and crumble it into the flour, until the mixture resembles a coarse cornmeal.\nTip: at this point, if you briefly heat the apricot berry mixture in the microwave or oven, until it is warm, it will help the biscuit topping to rise.\n3 Add almond extract and buttermilk: Add almond extract to the buttermilk, then form a well in the middle of the flour mixture and pour in the buttermilk.\nGently mix (with wooden spoon or your hands) until the dough just comes together. Do not over-mix.\n4 Form "cobblestone" shapes of the dough and arrange on the top of the apricot berry mixture. (You can also just crumble the dough over the top.) Sprinkle brown sugar over the top of the dough. Drizzle melted butter over the top (aim for the fruit more than the biscuits).\n5 Preheat oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. Let the cobbler sit and rise for 10-20 minutes before baking.\n6 Bake: Bake at 425\xc2\xb0F for 10-15 minutes or until the top is just beginning to brown, then reduce the heat to 350\xc2\xb0F. Cook for an additional 30 to 40 more minutes, until the center fruit is thickened and bubbly.\nCheck during cooking, if the topping is getting too brown, cover it with foil and turn the heat down to 325\xc2\xb0F.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nApricot Hamantaschen Recipe\nPrep time: 1 hour, 30 minutesCook time: 12 minutesChill time: 12-72 hoursYield: 26-36 cookies\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the apricot filling:\n1-1/4 cups (7 ounces) dried apricots, preferably Turkish\n2 tablespoons honey\nFor the dough:\n2 cups (262 grams) all-purpose flour\n3/4 cup (156 grams) sugar\n1/2 teaspoon baking powder\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter or margarine, chilled\n1 teaspoon finely grated lemon zest\n1 teaspoon finely grated orange zest\n1 large egg, lightly beaten\nSpecial equipment:\nFood processor\nBox grater\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the filling: Put the apricots in a small saucepan and add enough water to cover. Put on the lid, bring to a boil, reduce the heat, and simmer until the fruit is tender, about 10-15 minutes.\nRemove the apricots from the saucepan with a slotted spoon and place in a food processor. Reserve the cooking water.\nAdd the honey and 1 tablespoon of the cooking water to the food processor, and puree until very smooth, scraping down the sides of the food processor from time to time. If the fruit is too thick for the machine to puree it, add 1 to 2 more tablespoons of cooking water.\nScrape the filling into a container, let it cool, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate overnight or up to 3 days before baking.\n2 Make the dough: Lay a large sheet of plastic wrap on the counter.\nIn a large bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt. Using the large holes of a box grater, grate the margarine or butter into the bowl (work quickly so the butter does not melt). Add the lemon and orange zest.\nWork the grated butter into the flour with a pastry cutter or your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse cornmeal. Add the egg and knead with your hands for a minute or 2, until the dough is smooth and no longer crumbly.\nLay the dough on the plastic wrap, press into a flat rectangle, and wrap tightly. Chill in the refrigerator overnight, or up to 3 days.\n3 Heat the oven and prepare the baking sheets: Preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F and position racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Take the dough out of the refrigerator and let it come to temperature for 10 minutes.\n4 Roll out the dough Lightly flour your countertop. Cut the dough in half; return one half to the refrigerator.\nDust both sides of the dough lightly with flour. Roll out to an even 1/8-inch thickness. Use a dry pastry brush or your hands to brush off the excess flour. Using a 3-inch biscuit or cookie cutter or a drinking glass, cut the dough into rounds.\nPlace the rounds on the baking sheets as you go. Once your first sheet is filled, pop it in the fridge so the cookies keep their shape while you work on the second baking sheet. Save and refrigerate the dough scraps.\nRepeat with remaining half of dough, then re-roll scraps and get as many rounds as you can out of them. (You\xe2\x80\x99ll have anywhere between 26 to 36 rounds).\n5 Fill the cookies: Transfer the chilled filling to a piping bag or a zip-top sandwich bag with the corner snipped off.\nWorking with one baking sheet at a time, pipe a circle of filling (about 1-1/2 teaspoons) on the center of each dough round. (You will likely have extra filling. Store it in the refrigerator and use it to spread on toast or stir into yogurt.)\n6 Shape the cookies: Start by folding one edge over. Fold the second edge over so one corner overlaps the other and forms a 60-degree angle. Fold the third edge over, creating the three distinct corners of a triangle. The first few cookies you shape might not be perfect, but you\xe2\x80\x99ll get the hang of it quickly. There is no need to press, pinch or seal the edges.\n7 Bake the cookies: Arrange the cookies so they are about 2 inches apart (they should all fit on two baking sheets). Bake and set your timer for 6 minutes.\nWhen the timer goes off, rotate the sheets front to back and top to bottom. Reset the timer, and bake the cookies for an additional 5 to 10 minutes, or until the edges are golden brown. Total baking time will be 12 to 16 minutes.\n8 Cool the cookies: Cool the cookies on sheets for 2 minutes, then transfer to cooling racks with a metal spatula. You may serve the cookies warm, but they are best at room temperature.\nThe cookies are crispiest on the day you bake them, but they will last up to 3 days in a tightly covered container.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nHow to Cook and Eat an Artichoke\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 35 minutes\nINGREDIENTS\n1 or more large globe artichokes\n1-2 cloves of garlic, cut in half (can leave skin on)\n1 bay leaf\n1 slice of lemon\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\nHOW TO COOK AN ARTICHOKE\n1 Cut of the tips of the leaves: If the artichokes have little thorns on the ends of their leaves, take a kitchen scissors and cut off the tips. This step is mostly for aesthetics as the thorns soften with cooking and pose no threat to the person eating the artichoke. But snipping them off will make the artichokes easier to handle.\n2 Slice off the top of the artichoke: Slice about 3/4 inch to an inch off the tip of the artichoke. A serrated bread knife works great for this.\n3 Remove small leaves at the base: Pull off any smaller leaves towards the base and on the stem.\n4 Cut off excess stem: Cut off excess stem, leaving up to an inch on the artichoke. The stems can be more bitter than the rest of the artichoke, but some people like to eat them. The inner cores of the stems taste like the heart.\nAlternatively you can leave the whole long stem on the artichoke, just cut off the very end of the stem, and peel the tough outside layer of the stem with a vegetable peeler.\n5 Rinse the artichokes: Rinse the artichokes in running cold water. While you rinse them, open up the leaves a little so that the water gets inside more easily. (This is where it helps to have cut off the thorny tips, it makes the artichoke easier to open without getting poked!)\n6 Set up a pot with some water, aromatics, and a steaming basket: In a large pot, put a couple inches of water, the garlic, a slice of lemon, and a bay leaf (this adds wonderful flavor to the artichokes). Insert a steaming basket.\n7 Steam the artichokes: Place artichokes on top of the steaming basket. Cover the pot. Bring to a boil and reduce heat to simmer.\nCook for 25 to 35 minutes or longer, until the outer leaves can easily be pulled off.\nNote: artichokes can also be cooked in a pressure cooker (about 5-15 minutes at high pressure). Cooking time depends on how large the artichokes are. The larger, the longer they take to cook.\nHOW TO EAT AN ARTICHOKE\nArtichokes may be eaten cold or hot, but I think they are much better hot. They are served with a dip, either melted butter or mayonnaise. My favorite dip is mayo with a little bit of balsamic vinegar mixed in.\n1 Pull off the leaves and dip: Pull off the outer leaves, one at a time. Dip the white fleshy end in melted butter, a vinaigrette, or sauce.\n2 Place light end in mouth, dip side down, pull, scraping through your teeth: Tightly grip the other end of the petal. Place in mouth, dip side down, and pull through teeth to remove soft, pulpy, delicious portion of the petal. (Why dip-side down? Your tongue is where most of your taste buds are, so you\'ll get a fuller flavor if you strip the leaves that way.) Discard remaining petal.\nContinue until all of the petals are removed.\nWhen you get to the tender inner leaves with the purple tips, you can remove them all at once. Dip and eat just the light colored parts of these leaves.\n3 Scrape out the choke: With a knife or spoon, scrape out and discard the inedible fuzzy part (called the "choke") covering the artichoke heart.\n4 Cut the heart into pieces and eat: Underneath the artichoke choke is the heart. Cut the heart into pieces and dip into melted butter, a vinaigrette, or a sauce to eat.\nMy favorite artichoke dipping sauce? Some mayonnaise with a little balsamic vinegar stirred in.\nHello!

Chop the centers and put into a food processor. Pulse until you have coarse breadcrumbs. You should have about 3 cups.\n2 Make the stuffing: In a large bowl, stir together the breadcrumbs, lemon zest, Parmesan cheese, minced garlic, chopped parsley, minced oregano, 1/2 cup olive oil, and black pepper. Set aside.\n3 Prep the artichokes: Cut off the stem, leaving 1/2 inch from the bottom row of leaves. Using kitchen scissors, cut off 1/2-inch of the tips of all of the artichoke leaves.\nCut 1 inch from the top of the artichoke. (It helps to use a serrated knife like a bread knife for this.)\nTake a slice of lemon and rub over the cut edges of the artichokes to keep them from turning brown.\n4 Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xb0F (190\xc2\xb0C).\n5 Stuff the artichokes: Use your finger to gently pull open the center leaves of the artichokes. Pull out the inner tender yellow artichoke leaves. Use a small metal spoon to scrape and scoop out all of the inner fuzzy choke.\nNote that removing the choke at this stage isn't entirely necessarily, and it does require some elbow grease. That said, it makes eating the stuffed artichoke a much easier, and more enjoyable experience.\nPlace artichokes on a sheet pan (to catch the breadcrumbs) and start stuffing the artichoke with your stuffing mix. Put some stuffing mix between each large leaf and the artichoke, as well as a generous amount in the center.\n6 Bake the artichokes: Put about 1-inch of boiling water in the bottom of a Dutch oven that will snugly hold the artichokes. Add 2 slices of lemon, a bay leaf, 2 cloves garlic to the water.\nPlace the artichokes sitting upright in the water. Drizzle with remaining 2 Tbsp olive oil.\nCover the pot tightly with a lid. (Remember to cover the dish or this method will not work!)\nBake for 1 hour at 375\xc2\xb0F (190\xc2\xb0C), or until a knife easily penetrates the heart of the artichoke or you can easily remove one of the outer petals. (Depending on the size of the artichoke baking time can vary from 50 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes or longer.)\nRemove the cover and broil for a minute or so, enough to get some browning on the top of the stuffing.\nRemove artichokes to a serving dish to serve.\nHello!

Microwave on high heat for 30 seconds (or heat oil and herbs on the stovetop until warm). Let the herbs steep in the warm olive oil while you prepare the artichokes.\n2 Prep the artichokes: Prepare a large pot with an inch of water at the bottom. Add the cut cloves of garlic and the bay leaf, and place a steamer rack in the pot.\nTo prepare the artichokes, have lemon wedges ready. If you want a nice presentation, use scissors to snip away the pointy tips of the artichoke leaves. As you trim the artichokes, rub the cut areas with juice from the lemon wedges to prevent the artichokes from turning brown from oxidation.\nUse a vegetable peeler to cut away the thick outer layer of the artichoke stems. Trim the stems to 2 inches from the base of the artichoke. Cut off and discard the top 1/2 inch of the artichokes. Cut the artichokes in half.\nUse a strong metal spoon to scoop out the fuzzy chokes and the small inner artichoke leaves. Rub lemon juice all over the inside and exposed cut areas of the artichokes.\n\n3 Steam the artichokes: Heat the water in the large pot with a steamer rack on high. When it comes to a boil, reduce the heat to medium high and place the artichoke halves, cut side down on the steam rack.\nCover. Steam for 20 minutes (less or more, depending on the size of the artichokes), until you can easily pull off the outer leaves, and you can pierce the heart easily with a knife.\nThe artichokes can be just a tiny bit less cooked than would be typically perfect for steamed artichokes, as you will be cooking them further on the grill.\n4 Grill the artichokes: Prepare your grill for direct, high heat. Use a pastry brush to brush the artichoke all over with the herb infused oil. Sprinkle all over with salt.\nPlace the artichoke halves cut-side-down on the grill grates. Cover, and grill for 5 to 10 minutes, until you have nice grill mark on the cut sides of the artichokes.\nTo serve, sprinkle the cut sides with more lemon juice. Serve alone or with mayonnaise, remoulade, or aioli.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

You can also easily use a frozen pie shell, just keep it frozen, do not defrost.\nWe use goat cheese in this recipe. You could easily sub with grated Gruyere or Monterey jack.\nINGREDIENTS\nCrust:\n1 cup all purpose flour\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n1/2 cup (1 stick, 4 ounces, 8 Tbsp) butter\n2 to 2 1/2 Tbsp of water\nOne 9-inch pie dish\nQuiche: \n1/2 cup, packed, finely chopped artichoke hearts (cooked fresh or canned artichoke hearts packed in water)\n6 ounces cooked spinach (if using frozen, thaw first), squeezed to remove excess water (wrap in clean tea towel or several layers of paper towels and squeeze), finely chopped\n1 Tbsp butter\n1/2 cup minced shallots\n2 teaspoons grated lemon zest\n4 eggs (large)\n1 cup milk\n1/2 cup heavy whipping cream\n4 ounces goat cheese\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n2 Tbsp minced chives or green onion greens\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1a Make the dough for the quiche crust: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour and salt.\nCut the butter into cubes and use your (clean) hands to work the butter into the flour until you have a mixture that looks like a coarse meal with pieces of butter no bigger than a pea.\nSprinkle water onto the flour mixture a little at a time, and work the dough with your hands until the dough can be formed into a ball.\nFlatten the ball into a disk and wrap with plastic wrap. Chill for at least 1 hour.\n1b Roll out the dough: When you are ready to roll out the dough, remove the disk from the refrigerator and let come to room temp for 10 minutes.\nRoll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a diameter 2 inches wider than your pie or tart pan. Drape the rolled out dough over the pie or tart pan and press the dough into the sides of the pan. Trim and crimp the edges.\nPlace in freezer for 30 minutes to an hour.\n2 (Optional) Pre-bake the crust: At this point, if you want, you can "blind bake" or pre-bake the crust. Pre-baking the crust will ensure that the bottom crust is browned and won\'t get soggy. I often skip this step and find that although the bottom crust might not get browned, it\'s usually perfectly palatable.\nTo pre-bake a store-bought crust, just follow the directions on the crust package.\nTo pre-bake the homemade crust in this recipe, line the inside with aluminum foil and fill it with pie weights such as beans. The foil and the pie weights will help keep the sides of the crust from sliding down as it bakes.\nBake for 15 minutes at 375\xc2\xb0F, then remove the foil and weights, prick the bottom of the crust with the tines of a fork , and bake for another 10 minutes.

Add the sliced leeks and gently cook until softened, about 10 minutes.\n2 Add artichoke hearts, tarragon, salt: Once the leeks are cooked through and softened, add the artichoke hearts, tarragon, and salt. Cook until the artichoke hearts are warmed through, then remove from pan to a bowl and set aside.\n3 Make the egg batter: In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs and the cottage cheese.\nIn a small bowl, whisk together the flour, Parmesan, and baking powder.\nAdd the flour mixture to the egg mixture and whisk.\nStir the artichokes and leeks into the egg  mixture. Note that the color of the mixture may change, don't worry if this happens, it will go back to normal when cooked.\n4 Pour egg mixture into pan and gently cook: Wipe out the pan with a paper towel. Then melt another tablespoon of butter into the pan on medium heat, and swirl along the bottom and sides to coat well. Pour the egg mixture into the pan, swirling to make sure the artichokes and leeks are evenly distributed.\nLower the heat. Cover the pan, slowly cook on the stove top for 12 to 15 minutes, until all but the center has set. You'll need to check every few minutes.\nThe heat should be high enough to set the mixture, but low enough so that the edges don't brown. This frittata benefits from slow, gentle cooking.\n5 Finish in the broiler: Place rack in upper third of oven. Preheat the broiler. When the frittata is mostly set, except for the center which is still wiggly, place the pan in the oven. Broil for 3 to 4 minutes until the top is lightly browned and the center has set.\n6 Serve: Remove pan from oven. (Be careful about the hot handle! Use a pot holder. I like to run an ice cube over the handle to to be extra safe.) Use a blunt knife or a metal spatula to loosen the edges of the frittata from the pan. Gently insert the spatula under the frittata to loosen it from the bottom of the pan. Then gently slide the frittata onto a serving plate.\nGarnish with chives or parsley to serve.\nHello!

OR you can use stale bread that is no longer soft. Drying the bread in the oven will help keep it from falling apart when you add the egg mixture later.\n2 Cook the chopped bacon: Place bacon in medium skillet on medium high heat. Cook until bacon is lightly browned and much of the fat rendered. Remove bacon from pan with a slotted spoon, place on a paper towel lined plate to drain. Pour off all but enough bacon fat to coat the bottom of the pan (do not put down the drain, it will clog your pipes).\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions: Add chopped onions to the pan with bacon fat. Cook on medium high heat until lightly browned, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the bacon back to the pan with the onions, stir, remove from heat.\n4 Blanch the asparagus: While the onions are cooking, bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the asparagus and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain and shock the asparagus in ice water to stop the cooking.\n5 Mix eggs, milk, cheese: In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a fork or whisk. Whisk in the milk. Stir in the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir in the grated cheddar cheese.\n6 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n7 Place bread in egg milk mixture, fold in bacon and vegetables: Place the cubed bread in the egg milk mixture and press down with your hands so that the bread cubes absorb most of the egg milk mixture. Gently fold in the onions, bacon, asparagus, chopped artichoke hearts, and chives. (Be gentle as to not break up the bread.)\n8 Assemble the casserole: Generously butter the inside of a 2 1/2 to 3 quart (8 x 13 inch) casserole dish. Gently pour the bread egg milk vegetable mixture into the casserole dish and spread out in an even layer.\nAt this point you can make up to a day ahead.

b"Save It Print\nBraised Marinated Artichokes Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Serves 4\nChoose globe artichokes whose petals are closed. They'll be fresher than artichokes whose petals have started to open wide. Frost-kissed artichokes are especially delicious, so even though they may look a little blemished, they'll taste great.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 large globe artichokes\n1 lemon\n1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil\n3/4 cup sliced shallots\n3 cloves garlic, minced, about 1 Tbsp\n3 bay leaves\n1 cup dry white wine (such as a Sauvignon blanc)\n3/4 cup water\n1 teaspoon salt\n3 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley leaves\n2 Tbsp chopped fresh mint leaves\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the artichokes: Prepare a large bowl with cold water. Squeeze half a lemon into the water. Using a serrated knife (bread knife works well for this), cut off the top inch of the artichokes. Squeeze a little lemon over the cut areas to keep the artichokes from turning brown.\nUse kitchen shears to snip off the thorny tips of the artichoke leaves.\nUse the serrated knife to cut the artichokes into quarters.\nUse a metal teaspoon to scrape away the hairy choke above the artichoke heart. Remove the small, papery, purplish leaves close to the choke. Rub the cut areas again with lemon.\nPlace the quartered artichoke hearts into the bowl of acidulated water as you finish prepping them.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 shallots and garlic: Heat olive oil on medium heat in a thick-bottomed pot that will hold all of the artichokes tightly in a single layer. (Choose a pot with a tight-fitting lid.)\nWhen the oil is hot, add the shallots and saut\xc3\xa9 for 3 to 5 minutes, until softened.\nAdd the garlic and cook an additional minute.\n3 Add wine, water, bay leaves, salt, then simmer: Add the white wine, water, bay leaves, and salt to the pot. Make sure there is enough liquid to cover the bottom of the pan by 1/4-inch. If not, add more water until there is. Bring to a simmer, and simmer for a minute.\n4 Add quartered artichokes, simmer: Place the quartered artichokes, cut side down in a single layer, in the pot. Bring to a boil on high heat.\nCover the pot with a tight fitting lid and lower the heat to medium. Simmer for 20 minutes. (If it looks like the pot is at risk of running out of liquid, add more hot water to the pot.)\n5 Toss with parsley, mint, continue to simmer: Then toss with the parsley and mint, turning the artichokes over to coat them with the sauce, cover again, and cook for an additional 5 to 15 minutes, until the leaves are tender and are easy to pull off the artichoke.\nNote that older artichokes may take a longer cooking time (and therefore more water/wine in the pot) to get tender.\nLet cool to slightly warm or room temperature. Serve with some of the pan juices and shallots from the braising liquid. Especially good if you make a day ahead, giving the cooked artichokes more time to marinate. Just chill, and return to room temperature before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

Use a rolling pin to roll the dough into a large rectangle.\n3 Transfer the dough to the pan: Transfer the dough to the oiled sheet pan, stretching it out to the corners of the pan. If it springs back, wait a few minutes and then try again.\nDrizzle 1 tablespoon of the olive oil onto the dough. Use a pastry brush or your fingers to gently spread the oil all over the dough, taking care not to create any tears. Sprinkle the Italian seasoning evenly over the dough.\n4 Wilt the spinach: Heat the remaining tablespoon of oil and the garlic in a large skillet over medium heat. When the garlic begins to bubble, add the spinach. Saut\xc3\xa9 until the spinach has wilted, about 2 minutes, then turn off the heat.\n5 Top the pizza: If the dough has shrunk away from the corners, give it a final stretch to reach the sides of pan. Sprinkle on half of the mozzarella over the pizza, followed by the saut\xc3\xa9ed spinach and then the artichokes. Sprinkle with the rest of the mozzarella.\n6 Bake the pizza: Bake the pizza until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes.\n7 Slice and serve: Use two spatulas to lift the pizza from the pan and transfer it to a large cutting board to slice into squares, or use a pizza wheel to slice it right in the pan.

b"Print\nHow to Trim an Artichoke\nYou'll need a sharp paring knife, a large empty bowl for leaves, and a large bowl filled two-thirds with ice water.\nINGREDIENTS\nArtichokes\nA fresh lemon cut in half\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Squeeze half a lemon into a large bowl of water: If you are trimming more than one artichoke, squeeze half a lemon into a large bowl of ice water. You will be dropping trimmed artichokes into this bowl to keep them from browning while you work others.\n2 Snap off outer green leaves, then pull off yellow petals: Start by snapping off the artichoke leaves and tossing them into a large empty bowl. When you get to the yellow petals, just pull them off. Wipe the exposed surface with the other half of the lemon you cut.\n3 Pull out the pink tipped leaves: Take care when you get to the pink center of the artichoke leaves. There are sharp spines on the end of the inner leaves. Pull them out.\n4 Use a paring knife to dig out the fuzzy choke. You will want to slice off the narrowest layer of the heart to get all of the choke without cutting away too much of the delicious heart.\nA note on this whole process. Don\xe2\x80\x99t do it if there are distractions. You need to focus. You will be using a sharp knife close to your hands. Since artichokes are tough when raw, you can easily cut yourself if you take your eye off what you are doing.\n5 Rub cut lemon over exposed artichoke heart: Once the fuzzy choke is out, smear the cut lemon all over the exposed heart.\nThis prevents the heart from oxidizing and turning brown. An artichoke is still perfectly edible when oxidized, it just is not particularly attractive.\n6 Slice off all but the last inch or so of the stem. Rub lemon juice on the cut end.\n7 Trim the hard green exterior of the rest of the heart. Cut away from you as you rotate the artichoke, slicing off just the hard green part and leaving the light green underneath. Rub this with lemon.\n8 To finish, slice the outside layer off the stem and then coat the whole heart one more time with lemon. Drop into the lemon-water bath and go on to the next one.\nHere's a tip: as your cut lemon gets used up, put it in the water bath, which will help keep the bath\xe2\x80\x99s citric acid content high, and help keep the artichokes from browning.\nHello!

Peel and devein once thawed.\nWe are using artichokes canned in water for this recipe and we suggest including the artichoke water in with the risotto. Taste the artichoke water first. If it tastes good to you, then include. If not, then don\'t.\nYou can also use frozen or fresh cooked artichoke hearts instead of canned. For frozen you\'ll probably need about 8 ounces. For fresh, you\'ll probably need the hearts from 2 globe artichokes, cooked and finely chopped.\nSee How to Cook and Eat an Artichoke for instructions on cooking artichokes.\nINGREDIENTS\n12 ounces raw shrimp (26-30 size), about 18 pieces\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\nSalt\n1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1 Tbsp butter + 2 Tbsp butter\n1/3 cup minced shallots\n1 Tbsp minced garlic\n1 1/2 cup risotto rice (recommend carnaroli, can also use arborio)\n1/2 cup dry white wine (like a Sauvignon Blanc)\n8 ounces clam juice\n1 14-ounce can artichoke hearts packed in water, drained (reserve the water!), and finely chopped\n2-3 cups water\n2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toss shrimp with paprika, salt, pepper: Pat dry the peeled and deveined shrimp and place them in a medium bowl, toss to coat with 1/2 teaspoon salt, the paprika, and pepper.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 shrimp: Heat 1 Tbsp butter in a small saut\xc3\xa9 pan on high heat.

Then remove to a bowl and set aside.\n3 Simmer salted water: Put 3 cups of water with about a teaspoon of salt in a small saucepan. Heat until simmering and keep warm while you start the risotto.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 shallots, garlic: Heat 2 Tbsp butter in a 3 to 4-quart thick-bottomed pot on medium heat. Add the minced shallots and cook until translucent, about 3 to 4 minutes.\nAdd the garlic and cook a minute more.\n5 Add risotto rice: Add the risotto rice to the pot, stir to coat. Let cook for a minute or two for the rice to just barely begin to brown.\n6 Add 1/2 cup dry white wine. Let come to a low simmer and slowly stir until the wine has been absorbed by the rice.\n7 Add clam juice, artichoke can water: Add the clam juice and the reserved water from the can of artichokes, a half cup at a time, slowly stirring and allowing the rice to absorb the liquid before adding more liquid.\n8 Start adding hot salted water, 1/2 cup at a time: Once the rice as absorbed the wine, clam juice, and artichoke water, you can start adding the hot, lightly salted water from step one.\nAdd it 1/2 cup at a time, again stirring slowly allowing the rice to absorb it for a minute or two before adding any more. You\'ll need between 2 and 3 cups of water.\nYou\'ll want to stop adding water when the rice is cooked through, but still a little firm to the bite, "al dente".\n9 Stir in the chopped artichoke hearts.

Angle the knife toward the center of the artichoke while you do this so the result is more cone-shaped.\nUse a melon baller to scoop out and discard the fuzzy choke in the center of the artichoke.\nCut the artichoke into quarters, and cut each quarter into 3 or 4 slices. Place in the acidified water.\n2 Cook artichokes with sliced onions in olive oil: Heat olive oil in a 3 to 4 quart, thick-bottomed pot on medium heat. Add the sliced onions and artichoke hearts. Toss to coat with the olive oil.\nCook on medium low to low heat for 40 minutes or so, stirring occasionally, until the artichokes are completely cooked through and tender, and the onions are caramelized.\n3 Sprinkle with salt, sugar, and vinegar and cook for a few minutes more.\nHello!

Once they are trimmed, slice lengthwise into pieces roughly \xc2\xbc inch thick. You want them to look like silhouettes of an artichoke heart.\n2 Bathe the slices in a bowl of lemon juice.\n3 Heat garlic in olive oil: Get a large, heavy pot with a lid and pour in a layer of olive oil. Add the smashed garlic cloves and turn the heat to low.\n4 Add salted artichoke heart slices to the oil: Take some artichoke heart slices out of the lemon juice and salt them well. Slip them into the olive oil in layers, adding more olive oil to cover. You will probably need about a pint or so of olive oil \xe2\x80\x93 it is very important they are completely covered.\nDo not use cheap vegetable oil (corn, canola, etc) as a substitute because you will definitely taste the olive oil in the final dish. You could use melted butter, though\xe2\x80\xa6\n5 Heat on low: Cover the pot and cook on the lowest heat of your weakest burner for 45 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the oil cool for another 20-30 minutes.\n6 Remove from oil and toss with remaining ingredients: To make the salad, just remove the artichokes from the oil and toss with the remaining ingredients. You can eat the garlic or not, but it is just there to flavor the oil.\nServe at room temperature. It keeps for several days in the fridge.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Bring a large pot of salted water to boil.\n3 Season the salmon fillets: Rub both sides of the fillets with 1 teaspoon of the kosher salt and a 1/2 teaspoon of the black pepper.\n4 Sear the salmon: Heat 1 tablespoon of the olive oil over medium-high heat in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan (preferably nonstick). Once the oil starts to ripple in the pan, place the salmon fillets into the pan, skin-side up.\nPress the fillets down gently to make sure the entire surface makes contact with the pan. Sear the salmon fillets for 3 minutes, or until the flesh turns an opaque pink 1/4 of the way up the sides of the fillets.\n5 Flip the salmon and keep it hot: Use a spatula to flip the salmon and sear it, skin-side down, for an additional 3 minutes.\nTransfer the fillets to a sheet pan and place them in the heated oven while you finish the dish. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if the salmon is not cooked completely through just yet\xe2\x80\x94it will continue to cook in the oven.\n6 Cook the shallot and deglaze the pan: In the same pan you used to sear the salmon, heat the remaining tablespoon of olive oil and 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium-high heat. Add the shallot and the garlic to the pan and saut\xc3\xa9 for 3 minutes, or until glossy and fragrant.\nPour the white wine and lemon juice into the pan and use a wooden spoon to scrape up any bits of food that have stuck to the bottom of the pan. Add the lemon halves and bring the mixture to a boil.\n7 Reduce the sauce and cook the pasta: Reduce the sauce in the pan by half by maintaining a boil. This should take 3 to 4 minutes.\n8 Cook the pasta: By now, your pasta water should be at a rolling boil. Add generous tablespoon of salt to the boiling water and drop the pasta into the middle of the pot. Stir the pasta immediately to separate the noodles.\nLower the temperature slightly to prevent the water from boiling over and cook the pasta for 4 to 5 minutes, until al dente (or according to package directions). Drain the pasta.\n9 Finish the sauce:  Once the liquid in the pan has reduced by half, reduce the heat to medium-low. Remove the lemon halves. Slowly stir in the heavy cream and the remaining butter.\nAllow the sauce to come to a simmer, then add the arugula. Stir to coat the arugula in the sauce and allow it to wilt slightly\xe2\x80\x94this should only take a minute or so. Add the Parmesan, along with the remaining salt and pepper. Taste and adjust the seasoning, if necessary, by adding a bit more salt or pepper.\n10 Combine the pasta and sauce: Add the pasta to the pan with the sauce. Using tongs, toss in the pasta in the sauce until it is evenly coated.\n11 Serve the pasta with the salmon: Remove the warm salmon fillets from the oven and arrange on top of the pasta.

b"Save It Print\nEasy Steak Salad with Lemon Vinaigrette Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 10 minutesYield: Serves 4\nNo need to bring the steak to room temp before cooking. You sear on such high heat, and the steaks are so thin, it's actually better to cook the steak while it is still relatively chilled, if you want the centers to be rare.\nINGREDIENTS\nExtra virgin olive oil\n1 pound flank steak or skirt steak\nSalt and freshly ground pepper\n1/2 head lettuce greens\n1 bunch arugula (young leaves), tough stems removed\n1/2 red bell pepper, thinly sliced lengthwise and cut into 1-inch long pieces\n4 scallions, thinly sliced\n1 avocado, cut into bite-sized pieces\n4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled\nPomegranate seeds or thinly sliced kumquats (optional)\nFor the dressing:\n2 tablespoons lemon juice\n6 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard (smooth), or 1/2 teaspoon dry mustard\nSalt and pepper\nMETHOD\n1 Cook the steak: Heat a couple teaspoons of oil in a cast iron pan on high heat. Pat the steaks dry. Sprinkle the steaks on both sides with a little salt.\nSear the steaks in the pan on both sides, just until nicely browned. Remove pan from heat and cover. Let cook for a few minutes more, until the steak is done to your liking.\nYou can test with a meat thermometer. Remove steak from pan at 125\xc2\xb0F to 130\xc2\xb0F for rare, 140\xc2\xb0F for medium rare, 150\xc2\xb0 for medium.

Let rest for a few minutes before cutting. Cut thin slices, on a diagonal so you slice wide pieces, across the grain of the meat.\n3 Make the salads: Toss together the lettuce greens, arugula, bell pepper, goat cheese, and scallions. Arrange on individual plates. Sprinkle with avocado. Lay on top several slices of chilled sliced steak. Sprinkle with pomegranate seeds or sliced kumquats if using.\n4 Make dressing: Mix together the lemon juice, olive oil, mustard, and salt and pepper to taste. Drizzle on salad.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nSteak Salad with Arugula and Parmesan Cheese Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 11 minutesYield: 4 servings\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the salad\n5 ounces (about 6 cups) baby arugula\n2 tablespoons olive oil, plus more for serving\nSalt and pepper, to taste\n1/2 cup (1 ounce) shaved Parmesan Cheese\nFor the steak\nVegetable oil (for the grill)\n2 (1 1/2-inch thick) sirloin steaks (about 1 3/4 pounds)\n2 lemons, cut into wedges (for serving)\nOlive oil (for serving)\nMETHOD\n1 Make the salad: In a bowl, toss the arugula with 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Sprinkle generously with salt and pepper and toss again. Mix in the Parmesan Cheese. Divide among four plates.\n2 Prepare the grill: For charcoal grills, fill a grill chimney with charcoal and light it. When the coals are hot (they should be covered with a layer of fine gray ash) empty the coals into the grill and push them to one side of the grill to make higher heat and lower heat cooking zones. Set the grate in place and cover the grill. Preheat the grate for 5 minutes.\nFor gas grills, heat one burner to high and one to low (225F).\nFold a small piece of paper towel to make a 2-inch square, and pour a few tablespoons of oil into a shallow bowl. With tongs, dip the square into the oil, and brush the grates.\n3 Cook the steaks: Brush the steaks with olive oil and sprinkle them on both sides with salt and pepper. Place them on the hot side of the grill and cook until browned and slightly charred on one side, 3 to 4 minutes. Turn the steaks over and continue to grill 3 minutes longer, or until well browned.\nIf the steaks aren't quite cooked to your desired doneness at this point, move them to the cooler side of the grill to finish cooking. Cook to an internal temperature of 135F for medium-rare, 140F for medium, or 150F for well done.\nTransfer the steaks to a cutting board or platter, tent loosely with foil and let rest 5 minutes before slicing.\n4 To serve: Slice the steaks and divide the slices between the plates, placing them on top of the arugula. Drizzle with olive oil and squeeze lemon juice over the top. Sprinkle with more salt and pepper, if you like.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nArugula Corn Salad with Bacon Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n4 large ears of corn\n2 cups of chopped arugula (about one bunch)\n4 strips of bacon, cooked, chopped\n1/3 cup chopped green onions\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon white wine vinegar\n1/8 teaspoon ground cumin\nSalt and freshly ground black pepper to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the corn: Cook the corn ears, in their husks, either on the grill for a smoky flavor, or by steaming in a large covered stock pot with an inch of boiling water at the bottom of the pot, for 12-15 minutes, or by cooking in a microwave.\nLet the corn cool (can run under cold water to speed up the cooling), remove the husks and silk.\nI recommend cooking the corn in the husks for the added flavor that the husks impart. If you boil or steam the corn ears after you've already husked them, or if you cook them in the microwave, reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.\n2 Remove the corn kernels from the cobs: To remove the kernels from the cobs, stand a corn cob vertically with the tip on a small bowl that is inverted inside a larger, shallow bowl.\nUse a sharp knife to make long, downward strokes, removing the kernels from the cob, as you work your way around the cob.\nNote: it may help to work over a low table, to be in a better ergonomic position to cut the cobs this way.\n3 Make the dressing: In a separate bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, and cumin.\n4 Assemble the salad: In a medium sized bowl, mix together the corn, chopped arugula, bacon, and onions.\nMix dressing into salad just before serving. Taste and add more vinegar if necessary to balance the sweetness of the corn.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

It\xe2\x80\x99s best to supreme the citrus, which means to trim the peel off the citrus, then cut the individual segments of fruit from the inner membrane.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 slices (about 2 cups) sourdough bread, torn into bite-sized pieces\n1/4 cup plus 3 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided\n3/4 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper\n1/2 cup chopped walnuts\n2 citrus fruits, like orange, lemon, and/or grapefruit\n1 small head radicchio (about 4 cups), cored and cut into bite-sized pieces\n2 cups arugula\n1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Make the croutons: Heat the oven to 350\xcb\x9aF. Place the bread pieces on a rimmed baking sheet and toss with 1/4 cup olive oil. Sprinkle with 1/2 teaspoon salt and bake, tossing the bread on the baking sheet partway through, until golden and crunchy, about 15 minutes; let cool.\n2 Toast the nuts: While the croutons are in the oven, toast the nuts in a medium-sized skillet set over medium heat on the stovetop until fragrant and toasted, about 8-10 minutes. Stay near the pan, and stir the nuts occasionally. They can go from toasted to burnt in a matter of seconds. Let cool.\n3 Peel and segment (a.k.a. supreme) the citrus : For each fruit, cut about an inch off the top and bottom just so some of the flesh is exposed. Set the fruit with the cut-side down on a cutting board.\nStart at the top, and slice down the side of the fruit with a sharp knife, cutting away the peel and the pith, exposing the flesh. Then carefully cut out the citrus segments over a bowl to collect the juice. You should have about 1 cup of citrus segments.\n4 Squeeze the juice: Once all of the segments have been removed, squeeze the juice from what's left of the fruit into the same bowl. Drain the juice from the segments and keep separate.\n5 Make the citrus vinaigrette: In a mason jar or small bowl, combine 3 tablespoons of the reserved citrus juice with the remaining 3 tablespoons olive oil. Add pepper and the remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. Secure the lid if using a jar, and shake vigorously for a few seconds until emulsified. If using a bowl, whisk the ingredients together.\n6 Assemble the salad: Add the radicchio and arugula to a large bowl. Drizzle with the vinaigrette and toss until evenly coated. Taste and season with additional salt and pepper to suit your preferences. Add the croutons, walnuts, citrus segments, and feta cheese, and toss until evenly combined.\n7 To serve: Transfer to a large serving bowl for family-style eating, or divide among individual bowls for serving.\nHello!

Rinse the asparagus spears. If the ends are tough, break them off and either discard or save for stock. You can also use a vegetable peeler to peel away the tough outer skin of the fatter ends of the asparagus if you want.\n2 Drizzle asparagus with olive oil, salt, pepper, garlic: Line a roasting pan with foil. Arrange the asparagus spears in a single layer on the lined roasting pan.\nDrizzle with olive oil and rub the spears all over with the olive oil to coat. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and minced garlic, and rub over the asparagus spears to evenly distribute.\n3 Roast in oven: Roast at 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C) for 10 minutes, more or less, depending on your particular oven and how thick the spears are, until the asparagus are just lightly browned and tender when you pierce them with a fork.\n4 Drizzle with lemon juice or balsamic to serve: To serve, drizzle with fresh lemon juice or balsamic vinegar, and if you want, a sprinkling of grated Parmesan cheese (skip if cooking vegan).\nHello!

Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside.\n2 Prepare the asparagus: Rinse and pat dry the asparagus. Snap off the tough ends of the asparagus. Set asparagus spears aside. (Reserve the snapped ends for another meal, if you like.)\n3 Wrap the asparagus with prosciutto: Cut prosciutto slices in half down their length. Wrap each spear of asparagus with one strip of sliced prosciutto. Tug the prosciutto a little as you wrap it around the asparagus to give it tension. This helps to ensure that the prosciutto wraps around the asparagus tightly.\nLay the wrapped asparagus spears on the lined sheet pan.\n4 Drizzle the asparagus with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Sprinkle a pinch of black pepper on top.\n5 Bake the asparagus for 8 to 10 minutes. When done, the asparagus will be bright green and easily pierced with a fork, and the prosciutto will be crisped around the edges.\n6 Serve the asparagus. Transfer the asparagus to a serving platter. Top with lemon zest and freshly grated parmesan cheese, if using. Serve immediately while hot.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Stir often to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pan.\nContinue cooking and stirring rice, adding a little bit of broth at a time, cooking and stirring until it is absorbed, until the rice is tender, but still firm to the bite, about 20-25 minutes.\n5 Add the asparagus: With the last ladle of stock, add the asparagus. Stir and cook for a couple of minutes, until the risotto has absorbed the stock, but is still loose, and the asparagus are just cooked through.\nNote the stock amount given is approximate. You may need a little more or less. If you end up needing more stock and you find yourself without, just use water.\n6 Stir in the Parmesan, remaining butter, add salt, pepper: Turn off the heat.

Set your immersion circulator to 180\xc2\xb0F and let the water come up to temperature.\n2 Prep the asparagus: Wash the asparagus and, like a bunch of flowers, make a fresh cut on the bottom, eliminating any of the tough, woody ends.\nAdd the asparagus to a zip-top, gallon-sized plastic freezer bag. Add the black pepper and olive oil; save the salt for after it\xe2\x80\x99s cooked, as the salt will turn this green veggie a little grey. Toss together in the bag to distribute the ingredients.\nAdd a few heavy soup spoons to the bag to help weigh it down. This will help keep the asparagus submerged, which will ensure that it cooks evenly.\n  3 Seal the bag: Seal the bag as tightly as possible by using water-displacement method to help press out all the air. Just put the food in the bag and slowly lower it into the water, letting the pressure of the water press the air through the top of the bag. Once the air is out of the bag, seal it just above the water line. (Read more here.)\nYou can do this in the pot of water as it heats\xe2\x80\x94just be careful if the water is already steaming!\n4 Cook the asparagus: Once the water has come up to temperature, submerge the bag of asparagus in the pot of water. Make sure the bag is completely submerged (if it floats, remove it from the water and add a few more spoons to weigh it down).\n* Check the asparagus after 6 to 7 minutes if it\xe2\x80\x99s pencil thin.\n* Check average or thick asparagus after 8 to 10 minutes.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re at all in doubt, pull them out after 8 minutes, open the bag carefully, and use a fork to determine how tender the spears are. If the fork is getting stuck in the asparagus, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ready; reseal the bag and return it to the water for another minute or two.\n5 Serve: Remove from the water, turn off the circulator and serve immediately. Sprinkle some lemon juice and zest over the top of the asparagus, along with some of the cooking oil or butter (if desired) and some flaky sea salt, such as Maldon.\nLeftover asparagus will keep refrigerated for about 5 days.\nHello!

Bend the asparagus spears near the end and they will break naturally where the spear is no longer tough.\nFor an elegant presentation of the spears, use a vegetable peeler to peel off a very thin layer of the outer skin of the lower two to three inches of the asparagus spears.\nPrepare a large, shallow pan (with a cover) with a half inch of water and a steamer rack.\n2 Prepare the Hollandaise sauce: Melt the butter in a small pot. Put the egg yolks, lemon juice, salt and cayenne into a blender.\nBlend the eggs for 20-30 seconds at medium to medium high speed until lighter in color.\nTurn blender down to lowest setting and slowly drizzle in the hot melted butter while the blender is going. Continue to blend for a few seconds after all of the butter is incorporated.\nTaste the sauce and add more salt or lemon juice if needed. Keep warm while you are steaming the asparagus.\n3 Steam the asparagus: Bring the water in your steaming pan to a boil. Place the asparagus on the steaming rack. Cover.\nSteam for 3 to 5 minutes, until tender, but still a little crisp, definitely not mushy. The timing depends on how thick the asparagus spears are.\n4 Serve: To serve, plate the asparagus.

Add the asparagus and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain and shock the asparagus in ice water to stop the cooking.\n5 Mix eggs, milk, cheese: In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a fork or whisk. Whisk in the milk. Stir in the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir in the grated cheddar cheese.\n6 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n7 Place bread in egg milk mixture, fold in bacon and vegetables: Place the cubed bread in the egg milk mixture and press down with your hands so that the bread cubes absorb most of the egg milk mixture. Gently fold in the onions, bacon, asparagus, chopped artichoke hearts, and chives. (Be gentle as to not break up the bread.)\n8 Assemble the casserole: Generously butter the inside of a 2 1/2 to 3 quart (8 x 13 inch) casserole dish. Gently pour the bread egg milk vegetable mixture into the casserole dish and spread out in an even layer.\nAt this point you can make up to a day ahead.

Use 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme with the vegetables and 1/2 teaspoon sprinkled over the chicken.\nINGREDIENTS\n16 small new potatoes (red or golden), halved\n3 small sweet onions (such as Vidalia or Walla Walla), quartered through the roots; or 1 large super sweet onion, cut into thin wedges\n1 medium lemon, very thinly sliced\nLarge handful fresh lemon thyme or other fresh herb (oregano, marjoram, or thyme).\n5 tablespoons olive oil\n1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper, or more to taste\n2 large bone-in chicken breast halves (1 1/2 pounds, 680 g)\n2 whole chicken legs, thighs and drumsticks attached; or 2 legs and 2 drumsticks (1/2 pounds, 227 g)\n1 bunch (1 pound) fresh asparagus\nSpecial equipment:\nSheet pan, at least 11-by-17 inches or larger\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the vegetables for roasting: Heat the oven to 375F. In a bowl, combine the new potatoes, onions, lemon, a few of the herb sprigs, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and half the salt and pepper. Toss well and spread on a rimmed baking sheet.\n2 Roast the vegetables for 40 minutes, or until the potatoes are almost tender when pierced with a skewer.\n3 Prepare the chicken: While the vegetables roast, sprinkle the chicken with 2 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil, and the remaining salt and pepper. Remove the leaves from several thyme springs and scatter them on the chicken.\n4 Add the chicken to the vegetables and roast: Move the vegetables in the pan aside to make room for the chicken. Set the chicken in the pan, skin side up, so it isn\xe2\x80\x99t sitting on vegetables. Continue cooking for 30 minutes.\n5 Prepare the asparagus: Snap the spears near the base, where they break without much effort. Cut the spears in half to make shorter lengths. In a bowl, toss the asparagus with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil.\n6 Add the asparagus and roast: After the chicken has been roasting for 30 minutes, pull out the sheet pan and scatter the asparagus around the chicken.\n7 Continue roasting for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the chicken pieces all register at least 165\xc2\xb0F in the thickest part of the meat on an instant-read thermometer (the thighs will cook slightly faster than the breasts; you can pull them off the sheet pan as they reach temperature and keep them on a plate covered with foil, if you like).\nAll of the vegetables should also be cooked through. (Total cooking time is roughly 1 1/2 hours.)\nIf your chicken isn\xe2\x80\x99t brown enough, slide the pan under the broiler for 2 minutes, watching it carefully to avoid burning.\n8 To serve the chicken: Discard the cooked thyme sprigs. Use kitchen shears to separate the legs to form 2 drumsticks and 2 thighs. Snip the breasts in half horizontally.\nArrange the chicken and vegetables on a platter.

So keep your bacon chilled until you are ready to cut it, or put it in the freezer for several minutes before slicing.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 slices thick-sliced bacon (about 3 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 pound of asparagus, trimmed of woody ends, cut into 1/2-inch diagonal pieces\n6 slices of bread, cut into 1 1/2 inch wide square pieces, including crusts\n2 leeks, cleaned, cut in half lengthwise, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces, white and light green parts only, about 2 cups total\n2 Tbsp butter, divided 1 Tbsp and 1 Tbsp\n1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese\n8 eggs\n2 cups milk\n1/2 teaspoon of dried herbes de provence (can sub dried tarragon or thyme)\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Place bacon in a medium skillet on medium heat. Gently cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon pieces are lightly browned and much of the bacon fat has been rendered, about 10-12 minutes. Remove cooked bacon from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving the rendered bacon fat in the pan.\n2 While the bacon is cooking, cut up the bread. If the bread is a little stale, great. If it is fresh, then spread it out on a baking sheet and heat it in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for about 10-15 minutes to help it dry out a bit. This will help the keep the bread from disintegrating when mixed with the eggs later.\n3 Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the cut asparagus and blanch for 1 minute. Remove the asparagus from the pot to a bowl of ice water. Let cool in the ice water and then drain.\n4 Once the bacon is done and removed from the pan add a tablespoon of butter to the pan with the remaining bacon fat. Add the leeks and gently cook on medium to medium low heat for 10-12 minutes until the leeks are softened, but not browned. Do not let brown.\n5 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, crumbled feta cheese, herbes de provence, salt, and pepper.\n6 Place the bread pieces into the egg milk mixture and press down so that the bread becomes completely saturated with the mixture. Add the asparagus and leeks and gently mix to combine, taking care to not break up the bread.\n7 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. With the remaining tablespoon of butter, butter the insides of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle the bacon over the bottom of the dish. Gently pour the filling mixture into the casserole. Top with Parmesan cheese. Push the grated Parmesan down a bit into to the top of the casserole so that it gets moistened. (At this point you can make the night before, refrigerate and bake the next morning.)\n8 Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and the custard is cooked through. If the top is getting too brown before the custard is done, you can tent it with foil. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before cutting to serve.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nRoasted Asparagus Recipe\nPrep time: 6 minutesCook time: 12 minutesYield: Serves 4\nFor best results for roasting asparagus, use thick asparagus spears, not skinny ones. The thin ones will dry out too quickly and will end up tough and stringy.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound asparagus spears (thick spears are best for roasting)\n1-2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n2 cloves garlic, minced\nKosher Salt\nFreshly grated black pepper\nLemon juice (or balsamic vinegar)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven and prep asparagus: Preheat your oven to 400\xc2\xb0F (205\xc2\xb0C). Rinse the asparagus spears. If the ends are tough, break them off and either discard or save for stock.

Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper and set aside.\n2 Prepare the asparagus: Rinse and pat dry the asparagus. Snap off the tough ends of the asparagus. Set asparagus spears aside. (Reserve the snapped ends for another meal, if you like.)\n3 Wrap the asparagus with prosciutto: Cut prosciutto slices in half down their length. Wrap each spear of asparagus with one strip of sliced prosciutto. Tug the prosciutto a little as you wrap it around the asparagus to give it tension. This helps to ensure that the prosciutto wraps around the asparagus tightly.\nLay the wrapped asparagus spears on the lined sheet pan.\n4 Drizzle the asparagus with 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Sprinkle a pinch of black pepper on top.\n5 Bake the asparagus for 8 to 10 minutes. When done, the asparagus will be bright green and easily pierced with a fork, and the prosciutto will be crisped around the edges.\n6 Serve the asparagus. Transfer the asparagus to a serving platter.

Set your immersion circulator to 180\xc2\xb0F and let the water come up to temperature.\n2 Prep the asparagus: Wash the asparagus and, like a bunch of flowers, make a fresh cut on the bottom, eliminating any of the tough, woody ends.\nAdd the asparagus to a zip-top, gallon-sized plastic freezer bag. Add the black pepper and olive oil; save the salt for after it\xe2\x80\x99s cooked, as the salt will turn this green veggie a little grey. Toss together in the bag to distribute the ingredients.\nAdd a few heavy soup spoons to the bag to help weigh it down. This will help keep the asparagus submerged, which will ensure that it cooks evenly.\n  3 Seal the bag: Seal the bag as tightly as possible by using water-displacement method to help press out all the air. Just put the food in the bag and slowly lower it into the water, letting the pressure of the water press the air through the top of the bag. Once the air is out of the bag, seal it just above the water line. (Read more here.)\nYou can do this in the pot of water as it heats\xe2\x80\x94just be careful if the water is already steaming!\n4 Cook the asparagus: Once the water has come up to temperature, submerge the bag of asparagus in the pot of water. Make sure the bag is completely submerged (if it floats, remove it from the water and add a few more spoons to weigh it down).\n* Check the asparagus after 6 to 7 minutes if it\xe2\x80\x99s pencil thin.\n* Check average or thick asparagus after 8 to 10 minutes.\nIf you\xe2\x80\x99re at all in doubt, pull them out after 8 minutes, open the bag carefully, and use a fork to determine how tender the spears are. If the fork is getting stuck in the asparagus, it\xe2\x80\x99s not ready; reseal the bag and return it to the water for another minute or two.\n5 Serve: Remove from the water, turn off the circulator and serve immediately. Sprinkle some lemon juice and zest over the top of the asparagus, along with some of the cooking oil or butter (if desired) and some flaky sea salt, such as Maldon.\nLeftover asparagus will keep refrigerated for about 5 days.\nHello!

OR you can use stale bread that is no longer soft. Drying the bread in the oven will help keep it from falling apart when you add the egg mixture later.\n2 Cook the chopped bacon: Place bacon in medium skillet on medium high heat. Cook until bacon is lightly browned and much of the fat rendered. Remove bacon from pan with a slotted spoon, place on a paper towel lined plate to drain. Pour off all but enough bacon fat to coat the bottom of the pan (do not put down the drain, it will clog your pipes).\n3 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions: Add chopped onions to the pan with bacon fat. Cook on medium high heat until lightly browned, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the bacon back to the pan with the onions, stir, remove from heat.\n4 Blanch the asparagus: While the onions are cooking, bring a small pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the asparagus and blanch for 2 minutes. Drain and shock the asparagus in ice water to stop the cooking.\n5 Mix eggs, milk, cheese: In a large bowl, beat the eggs with a fork or whisk. Whisk in the milk. Stir in the 1 1/2 teaspoons salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper. Stir in the grated cheddar cheese.\n6 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F.\n7 Place bread in egg milk mixture, fold in bacon and vegetables: Place the cubed bread in the egg milk mixture and press down with your hands so that the bread cubes absorb most of the egg milk mixture. Gently fold in the onions, bacon, asparagus, chopped artichoke hearts, and chives.

b"Save It Print\nSheet Pan Chicken with Asparagus and Potatoes Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesYield: 4 servings\nIf you can't find the chicken parts called for in this recipe, you can buy a whole chicken and cut it into parts yourself (or ask a butcher to do it for you).\nIf you don't have fresh herbs, you can substitute dried thyme. Use 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme with the vegetables and 1/2 teaspoon sprinkled over the chicken.\nINGREDIENTS\n16 small new potatoes (red or golden), halved\n3 small sweet onions (such as Vidalia or Walla Walla), quartered through the roots; or 1 large super sweet onion, cut into thin wedges\n1 medium lemon, very thinly sliced\nLarge handful fresh lemon thyme or other fresh herb (oregano, marjoram, or thyme).\n5 tablespoons olive oil\n1 teaspoon salt, or more to taste\n1/2 teaspoon black pepper, or more to taste\n2 large bone-in chicken breast halves (1 1/2 pounds, 680 g)\n2 whole chicken legs, thighs and drumsticks attached; or 2 legs and 2 drumsticks (1/2 pounds, 227 g)\n1 bunch (1 pound) fresh asparagus\nSpecial equipment:\nSheet pan, at least 11-by-17 inches or larger\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the vegetables for roasting: Heat the oven to 375F. In a bowl, combine the new potatoes, onions, lemon, a few of the herb sprigs, 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and half the salt and pepper. Toss well and spread on a rimmed baking sheet.\n2 Roast the vegetables for 40 minutes, or until the potatoes are almost tender when pierced with a skewer.\n3 Prepare the chicken: While the vegetables roast, sprinkle the chicken with 2 tablespoons of the remaining olive oil, and the remaining salt and pepper. Remove the leaves from several thyme springs and scatter them on the chicken.\n4 Add the chicken to the vegetables and roast: Move the vegetables in the pan aside to make room for the chicken. Set the chicken in the pan, skin side up, so it isn\xe2\x80\x99t sitting on vegetables. Continue cooking for 30 minutes.\n5 Prepare the asparagus: Snap the spears near the base, where they break without much effort. Cut the spears in half to make shorter lengths. In a bowl, toss the asparagus with the remaining 1 tablespoon oil.\n6 Add the asparagus and roast: After the chicken has been roasting for 30 minutes, pull out the sheet pan and scatter the asparagus around the chicken.\n7 Continue roasting for 10 to 20 minutes, or until the chicken pieces all register at least 165\xc2\xb0F in the thickest part of the meat on an instant-read thermometer (the thighs will cook slightly faster than the breasts; you can pull them off the sheet pan as they reach temperature and keep them on a plate covered with foil, if you like).\nAll of the vegetables should also be cooked through. (Total cooking time is roughly 1 1/2 hours.)\nIf your chicken isn\xe2\x80\x99t brown enough, slide the pan under the broiler for 2 minutes, watching it carefully to avoid burning.\n8 To serve the chicken: Discard the cooked thyme sprigs. Use kitchen shears to separate the legs to form 2 drumsticks and 2 thighs. Snip the breasts in half horizontally.\nArrange the chicken and vegetables on a platter. Remove the thyme from the remaining fresh sprigs and sprinkle it over the chicken.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nBreakfast Casserole with Leeks and Asparagus Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nPro tip: raw bacon is much easier to slice if it is frozen. So keep your bacon chilled until you are ready to cut it, or put it in the freezer for several minutes before slicing.\nINGREDIENTS\n3 slices thick-sliced bacon (about 3 ounces), cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 pound of asparagus, trimmed of woody ends, cut into 1/2-inch diagonal pieces\n6 slices of bread, cut into 1 1/2 inch wide square pieces, including crusts\n2 leeks, cleaned, cut in half lengthwise, sliced crosswise into 1/2-inch pieces, white and light green parts only, about 2 cups total\n2 Tbsp butter, divided 1 Tbsp and 1 Tbsp\n1/2 cup of crumbled feta cheese\n8 eggs\n2 cups milk\n1/2 teaspoon of dried herbes de provence (can sub dried tarragon or thyme)\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper\n1/4 cup of freshly grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Place bacon in a medium skillet on medium heat. Gently cook, turning occasionally, until the bacon pieces are lightly browned and much of the bacon fat has been rendered, about 10-12 minutes. Remove cooked bacon from the pan with a slotted spoon, leaving the rendered bacon fat in the pan.\n2 While the bacon is cooking, cut up the bread. If the bread is a little stale, great. If it is fresh, then spread it out on a baking sheet and heat it in a 200\xc2\xb0F oven for about 10-15 minutes to help it dry out a bit. This will help the keep the bread from disintegrating when mixed with the eggs later.\n3 Bring a small pot of water to a boil. Add the cut asparagus and blanch for 1 minute. Remove the asparagus from the pot to a bowl of ice water. Let cool in the ice water and then drain.\n4 Once the bacon is done and removed from the pan add a tablespoon of butter to the pan with the remaining bacon fat. Add the leeks and gently cook on medium to medium low heat for 10-12 minutes until the leeks are softened, but not browned. Do not let brown.\n5 In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, milk, crumbled feta cheese, herbes de provence, salt, and pepper.\n6 Place the bread pieces into the egg milk mixture and press down so that the bread becomes completely saturated with the mixture. Add the asparagus and leeks and gently mix to combine, taking care to not break up the bread.\n7 Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F. With the remaining tablespoon of butter, butter the insides of a 9x13-inch casserole dish. Sprinkle the bacon over the bottom of the dish. Gently pour the filling mixture into the casserole. Top with Parmesan cheese. Push the grated Parmesan down a bit into to the top of the casserole so that it gets moistened. (At this point you can make the night before, refrigerate and bake the next morning.)\n8 Bake, uncovered, for 45 minutes or until the top is lightly browned and the custard is cooked through. If the top is getting too brown before the custard is done, you can tent it with foil. Remove from oven and let cool for 5 minutes before cutting to serve.\nHello!

Heat on medium heat, stirring occasionally, until fragrant and lightly browned.\nRemove pine nuts from pan and set aside. You will use 3/4 cup of the pine nuts for the pesto paste and 1/4 cup to mix in whole.\n3 Blanch asparagus: Salt the asparagus water and drop the spears into the pan. Cook for only 2 or 3 minutes, until the spears are bright green and barely tender.\nDrain under cool water to stop the cooking. Cut the tips off, and set aside, several of the asparagus (diagonal cut about an inch from the end) to use for garnish.\n4 Make asparagus pesto: Add the asparagus, spinach, garlic, Parmesan, and 3/4 cup of the pine nuts to a food processor.\nPur\xc3\xa9e and, with the motor running, drizzle in the 1/4 cup of olive oil until a paste forms. If too thick, thin it with a bit of the pasta water.\nAdd the lemon juice and salt, taste and adjust seasoning.\nHere's a trick that Heidi taught me. When emptying the food processor bowl of its contents, hold the bottom of the bowl with one hand with a finger in the center hole, holding the blade in place and keeping it from falling out.\n5 Make pasta, toss with pesto: Salt the pasta water well and cook the pasta until just tender. Check the directions on the pasta package. You'll need more time for dried pasta and less for fresh.\n\nThis fresh pasta cooked up in no time at all.\nDrain and toss immediately with 1 cup of the asparagus pesto.\nServe sprinkled with the remaining 1/4 cup toasted pine nuts, a dusting of Parmesan, and a light drizzle of olive oil.\nHello!

Press the dough all around the bottom edge so it sticks to the pan. With scissors, cut the pastry around the top edge so it has an even 1-inch overhang.\n2 Crimp the dough: Tuck the overhang inside the pan all around, like a hem. Crimp the top edge with your fingers.\n3 Chill the pie crust: Set the pie crust on a rimmed baking sheet. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and freeze for 1 hour. (At this point, you can freeze it overnight, loosely covered; if you want to freeze for up to 1 month, wrap tightly after the crust is frozen).\n4 Blind bake the pie crust: Heat the oven to 375F. Prick the dough all over with a fork. Line the dough with parchment paper or crumpled foil, and fill with pie weights or dried beans.\nBake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the top edge of the pastry is beginning to take on some color. Lift off the paper or foil and beans, and set aside. Return the pie crust to the oven and continue baking for 5 to 10 minutes, or until the bottom of the dough is beginning to cook through. If the dough forms puffs, prick them with the tip of a knife.\nSet on a wire rack to cool. Leave the oven on.\n5 Prepare the asparagus: Snap off the dry and woody part of the spears near the base, where they break without much effort. Cut the spears into 1-inch pieces.\nBring a saucepan of water to a boil. Add the asparagus and cook for 1 minute. Drain and transfer the asparagus to ice water to cool.\nDry the asparagus with paper towels. Set aside 3 asparagus tips to garnish the quiche. Halve the remaining pieces lengthwise.\n6 Finish the filling: Scatter the blanched asparagus (not the tips) and Fontina over the bottom of the cooled pie crust. Thoroughly stir the cream into the eggs, add salt and pepper, and pour the egg mixture over the asparagus and cheese.\n7 Bake the quiche: Return the pan to the oven and bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the filling is set all over and the top is starting to brown. Set on a wire rack to cool completely.\n8 Serve: Garnish the top of the quiche with the reserved asparagus tips before serving.\nThe quiche can be served immediately, or once cool, cover and refrigerate for up to 5 days. Quiche can be served cold, room temperature, or warm. (If serving warm, heat in a 300F oven until just warm to the touch.)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Wash your hands thoroughly after handling and do not touch your eyes or the area near your eyes with your hands for several hours.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 ripe avocados\n1/4 teaspoon of salt, more to taste\n1 tablespoon fresh lime juice or lemon juice\n2 tablespoons to 1/4 cup of minced red onion or thinly sliced green onion\n1-2 serrano chiles, stems and seeds removed, minced\n2 tablespoons cilantro (leaves and tender stems), finely chopped\nA dash of freshly grated black pepper\n1/2 ripe tomato, seeds and pulp removed, chopped\nRed radishes or jicama, to garnish\nTortilla chips, to serve\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cut the avocado, remove flesh: Cut the avocados in half. Remove the pit. Score the inside of the avocado with a blunt knife and scoop out the flesh with a spoon. (See How to Cut and Peel an Avocado.) Place in a bowl.\n2 Mash with a fork: Using a fork, roughly mash the avocado. (Don't overdo it! The guacamole should be a little chunky.)\n3 Add salt, lime juice, and the rest: Sprinkle with salt and lime (or lemon) juice. The acid in the lime juice will provide some balance to the richness of the avocado and will help delay the avocados from turning brown.\nAdd the chopped onion, cilantro, black pepper, and chiles. Chili peppers vary individually in their hotness. So, start with a half of one chili pepper and add to the guacamole to your desired degree of hotness.\nRemember that much of this is done to taste because of the variability in the fresh ingredients. Start with this recipe and adjust to your taste.\nChilling tomatoes hurts their flavor, so if you want to add chopped tomato to your guacamole, add it just before serving.\n4 Serve: Serve immediately, or if making a few hours ahead, place plastic wrap on the surface of the guacamole and press down to cover it and to prevent air reaching it. (The oxygen in the air causes oxidation which will turn the guacamole brown.) Refrigerate until ready to serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nHow to Cut and Peel an Avocado\nPrep time: 1 minute\nINGREDIENTS\n1 avocado\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Grip the avocado gently on one side with one hand. With a large, sharp knife in the other hand, cut the avocado lengthwise around the seed. Open the two halves to expose the pit.\n2a At this point there are a few ways you can proceed to remove the pit from the avocado half that has the pit. One way is to use a spoon to scoop out the pit.\nOne way is to make another cut, lengthwise on the avocado half that has the pit, cutting around the pit, exposing it so that it is easier to remove.\n2b Another method is a bit tricky, as you'll see. This method is very popular, but you must be careful lest you cut your hand. For safety, fold up a kitchen towel and use that to hold the avocado half with the pit.\nGently tap the pit with a knife with enough force so that the knife edge wedges into the pit, but not so hard as to cut all the way through it. If unsure, just tap it very gently a few times, each time with increasing pressure, until a cut is made in the pit sufficiently to twist the pit out. Getting the pressure just right takes a little practice.\nWith the edge of the knife, twist the pit out of the avocado and discard.\n3a At this point, you can either scoop out the avocado flesh with a spoon (for making guacamole), or slice the avocado into segments.\nTo make it more easy to scoop out the avocado flesh, take a knife (you can easily use a dull dinner knife) and gently make cuts in the avocado flesh in a cross-hatch pattern, careful not to break through the avocado peel. Then use a spoon to easily scoop out the avocado pieces.\nIf you are making guacamole, don't worry about slightly discolored or brownish sections. Scoop them up with the rest of the avocado to mash.\n3b To make avocado slices, use a knife to slice the inside of the avocado halves into sections. Don't worry if you cut right through the peel.\n4 Use your fingers to separate the avocado segments from the peel.\n  Hello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Fill a saucepan with 1 inch of water and insert a steamer basket. (If you don't have a steamer basket, that's ok.)\nBring the water to a boil, gently place 6 eggs in the steamer basket or directly in the saucepan. Cover the pot. Set your timer for 15 minutes. Remove eggs and set in icy cold water to cool. For more advice, see our How to Steam Hard Boiled Eggs. (You can also pressure cook them.)\n2 Prep the eggs: Once they've cooled, carefully peel the hard boiled eggs and cut them in half lengthwise. Place them on a serving platter. Scoop out the cooked yolks and set aside.\n3 Make the filling: Cut the avocados in half. Remove the pit. Scoop out the avocado flesh and place in a bowl. (See How to Cut and Peel an Avocado.)\nRoughly mash with a fork. Use your fingers to break up one or two of the cooked egg yolks (2 to 4 halves) over the mashed avocado. (Reserve the remaining egg yolks for another use.) Sprinkle with lime juice and salt, and stir in the sour cream. Stir in the chopped cilantro, serrano or jalape\xc3\xb1o chile pepper, and chives.\n4 Fill the egg halves: Scoop a generous spoonful of the avocado mixture into each well of the hard boiled egg whites.

b'Save It Print\nPan Seared Salmon with Avocado Remoulade Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 4\nINGREDIENTS\n2 large avocados, cut and peeled\n3 tablespoons freshly squeezed lime juice (can substitute lemon)\n3-4 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\n1 tablespoon minced shallots or green onion\n1 tablespoon minced parsley\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard or to taste\nSalt and pepper to taste\n1 to 1 1/2 pounds of salmon fillets\nMETHOD\n1 Make avocado remoulade sauce: Put avocado pieces and lime juice into a food processor or blender and pulse until blended.\nSlowly add olive oil, pulsing, until you reach desired consistency of sauce.\nAdd minced shallots (or green onions) and parsley, pulse just until combined.\nRemove to a bowl, add mustard, salt and pepper to taste.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 salmon fillets: Heat a tablespoon of oil in a saut\xc3\xa9 pan on medium high heat.\nSeason both sides of the salmon fillets with salt and pepper. Place the fillets in the hot pan and lower the heat to medium.\nIf your fillets are skin-on, you can either place the fillets in the pan skin-side up or skin-side down. If you first place the fillets skin-side up, the fillets will be easier to turn over without falling apart, because the raw skin will help hold the fillet together. If you place the fillets in the pan skin-side down to start, this will help crisp up the skin, which can be a tasty treat on its own.\nCook the salmon until about medium doneness, about 3-4 minutes per side.\n3 Serve: Serve salmon with avocado remoulade sauce.\nHello!

b'Print\nSalmon Avocado Poke Bowl Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesYield: 2 to 3 servings\nI use short-grain white rice (sometimes also called "sushi rice") in my bowls, but it\'s fine to use medium- or long-grain rice if that\'s what you have in your kitchen.\nGluten-free option: Substitute 3 tablespoons of tamari for the soy sauce. Because of the deeper color of the tamari, your salmon may not look as vibrant once mixed with the dressing.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the poke bowl:\n1 cup short-grain white rice\n1 pound sashimi-grade salmon\n1/4 cup soy sauce\n1 1/2 tablespoons rice vinegar\n1/2 tablespoon sugar\n1 teaspoon toasted sesame oil\n1/4 teaspoon garlic powder\n2 scallions, thinly sliced\nOther toppings for your bowl:\nSliced cucumber\nSliced radish\n1 large avocado, cubed\nFurikake\nRed pepper flakes\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the rice: Start the rice first and prep the rest of the ingredients while it cooks. Rinse the rice a few times under cool water, rubbing it gently with your hands, until the water isn\'t quite so cloudy. Then cook the rice according to package instructions or in a rice cooker. Fluff and keep covered until ready to eat.\n2 Prepare the salmon: Gently pat the salmon all over to make sure that there are no pin bones still lodged in the fillet; if there are, use needle-nosed pliers to remove them. Cut the salmon into 1/2-inch cubes. Add the salmon into a medium bowl and set aside.\n3 Make the dressing: In a small bowl, stir together the soy sauce, rice vinegar, sesame oil, sugar and garlic powder. The garlic powder and sugar will not dissolve completely, but that\'s fine.\n4 Combine the salmon and the dressing: Add the sliced scallions to the bowl with the salmon, saving 1 to 2 tablespoons for garnish. Add the soy sauce mixture to the salmon and scallions. Using a large spoon or a rubber spatula, gently mix the salmon with the soy sauce mixture.\n5 Serve: Divide the rice between each bowl and then the salmon. Top with the rest of the sliced scallions, sliced cucumber, sliced radishes, diced avocado, furikake and red pepper flakes, if you like. The poke bowl is best enjoyed immediately.\nHello!

Roast the peppers for 7-8 minutes until the skins are charred and blistered, turning the peppers as they begin to shake, and the seeds inside make snapping noises.\n2 Steam the peppers and remove the skins: Once the peppers have been charred, remove them from the heat. Put the peppers into a shallow dish or bowl and cover them with a towel to steam.\nAfter the peppers steam, their skins are easy to remove. Use the back of your knife to scrape the charred, papery skins from the peppers, then discard.\n3 Dice the peppers: Once the skins have been removed, slice off the stem end of each pepper. Cut the poblano and jalape\xc3\xb1os in half lengthwise, then scrape away the white membrane and the seeds with the back side of your knife (this helps prevent scraping away valuable pepper flesh).\nBecause serrano peppers are so skinny, rather than slice them in half, use the back of your knife blade and drag it down the length of the pepper to push the seeds out from the cut end.\nDice the peppers into 1/4-inch pieces.\n4 Mash the avocados: Cut the avocados in half and remove, then discard the pits. Scoop the avocado flesh into the mixing bowl and use a fork or potato masher to smash the avocado into a semi-chunky paste.\nGently stir in the lime juice to help delay the browning of the avocado. Try to avoid stirring too much as it will break up the avocado.\n5 Finish the guacamole: Fold in the chiles, red onion, cilantro, cumin, and salt until the ingredients are well incorporated. Taste the guacamole and adjust the salt to suit your preference.\n6 Allow the flavors to meld: Press a piece of plastic wrap against the surface of the guacamole and cover your bowl with a lid. Refrigerate the guacamole for at least 15 minutes to allow the flavors of the chiles and the cumin to meld and deepen.\nEnjoy the guacamole within 3 days. Store leftovers covered in the refrigerator. If the guacamole browns, scrape off the brown layer and discard before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

b'Save It Print\nSpaghetti Pasta Carbonara Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: Serves 4-6\nThis recipe uses raw eggs, which are essentially cooked by tossing with hot pasta. They are not cooked to the point of scrambled though, just enough to thicken the eggs into a sauce.\nThe garlic is optional. It is not usually included in pasta carbonara, but it tastes great so we\'ve included it. By the way, "guanciale", or pork jowl, is traditionally used in this dish, so if you can get it, by all means use it.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil or unsalted butter\n1/2 pound pancetta or thick cut bacon, diced\n1-2 garlic cloves, minced, about 1 teaspoon (optional)\n3-4 whole eggs\n1 cup grated parmesan or pecorino cheese\n1 pound spaghetti pasta (or bucatini or fettuccine)\nSalt and black pepper to taste\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat pasta water: Put a large pot of salted water on to boil (1 Tbsp salt for every 2 quarts of water.)\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 pancetta/bacon and garlic: While the water is coming to a boil, heat the olive oil in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until crispy.\nAdd the garlic (if using) and cook another minute, then turn off the heat and put the pancetta and garlic into a large bowl.\n3 Beat eggs and half of the cheese: In a small bowl, beat the eggs and mix in about half of the cheese.\n4 Cook pasta: Once the water has reached a rolling boil, add the dry pasta, and cook, uncovered, at a rolling boil.\n5 Toss pasta with pancetta/bacon: When the pasta is al dente (still a little firm, not mushy), use tongs to move it to the bowl with the bacon and garlic. Let it be dripping wet. Reserve some of the pasta water.\nMove the pasta from the pot to the bowl quickly, as you want the pasta to be hot. It\'s the heat of the pasta that will heat the eggs sufficiently to create a creamy sauce.\nToss everything to combine, allowing the pasta to cool just enough so that it doesn\'t make the eggs curdle when you mix them in. (That\'s the tricky part.)\n6 Add the beaten egg mixture: Add the beaten eggs with cheese and toss quickly to combine once more. Add salt to taste. Add some pasta water back to the pasta to keep it from drying out.\nServe at once with the rest of the parmesan and freshly ground black pepper.\nIf you want, sprinkle with a little fresh chopped parsley.\nHello!

Have on hand a rimmed baking sheet.\n2 Make the stuffing: In a skillet over medium heat, heat the oil. Add the apple, onion, rosemary, and thyme, and cook for 7 to 9 minutes, or until softened. Meanwhile, pulse the bread slices in a food processor until you make coarse crumbs. You should have about 1/2 cup of breadcrumbs.\nRemove the pan with the onions and apples from the heat, and stir in the breadcrumbs, mustard, salt, and pepper. Set aside to cool briefly.\n3 Butterfly the tenderloin: Cut a deep lengthwise slit down the center of the tenderloin, stopping about 1/2-inch from the bottom of the roast. Open it up like a book. Cover with a piece of plastic wrap, and with a mallet or rolling pin, gently pound it until it is of an even thickness.\n4 Stuff the tenderloin: Spread the stuffing in a line along the center of the meat. Bring the edges of the meat together to return it to its original shape. Secure with toothpicks.\n5 Wrap the bacon slices around the meat: Lay out the bacon slices on a cutting board, overlapping them slightly. Place the tenderloin on top with the toothpicks facing up. Removing the toothpicks as you work, wrap the bacon slices around the pork to form a log. Place the tenderloin, bacon seam side down, on the baking sheet. \n6 Roast the tenderloin: Roast for 20 to 25 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the meat registers 145F to 150F and the bacon is brown and crisp. If the roast is ready before the bacon browns, place the tenderloin under the broiler for 3 to 5 minutes to brown the bacon.\n7 Let the tenderloin rest for 10 minutes before cutting into slices.

b"Save It Print\nBean and Bacon Soup Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesBean soaking time: 8 hoursYield: Serves 6 to 8\nIn this recipe we are making the bean soup starting with dry beans that we soak overnight. If you don't have time to soak beans overnight, you can put the beans into a pot of water, bring the water to a boil, remove from heat, and let sit for hour, and then drain. Pre-soaking the beans will help them cook faster.\nIf you would rather work with canned beans, use 3 to 4 15-ounce cans of drained white beans and cook them in step 3 for only 15 minutes, not an hour.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound dry Great Northern white beans, covered with a couple inches of water and soaked overnight\n5 ounces of bacon, cut into 1/2-inch wide pieces\n2 cups chopped onion (1 large onion)\n3/4 cup chopped celery (about 2 ribs of celery)\n3/4 cup chopped carrots (1 large carrot)\n3 cloves garlic, minced (about 1 tablespoon)\n6 cups chicken stock\n2 bay leaves\n1 Tbsp fresh thyme\n2 1/2 teaspoons kosher salt\n1/4 teaspoon black pepper\n3 Tbsp tomato paste\n1/2 teaspoon paprika\n1 ounce bacon (1 to 2 slices), cooked and crumbled for garnish (optional)\n2 Tbsp chopped fresh parsley for garnish (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Drain the beans: Drain the beans that have been soaking in water. (If you haven't already soaked the beans, and you don't have time to do so overnight, you can put them in a large pot of water, bring to a boil, remove from heat and let sit for an hour, then drain.)\n2 Cook the bacon and vegetables: Put the bacon into a large (5 to 6 quart) thick-bottomed Dutch oven on medium high heat. Let the bacon cook for a minute or two to start rendering out some of its fat, then add the chopped onion, celery, and carrots.\nLower the heat to low, cover and cook for 12 to 15 minutes, until vegetables are completely cooked through and softened. Add the garlic and cook a minute more.\n3 Add beans, stock, seasonings, simmer: Add the drained beans to the pot. Add the stock, the bay leaves, thyme, salt and pepper.\nIncrease heat to high to bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a simmer, partially covered, for 1 hour or until the beans are very soft.\n4 Add tomato paste and paprika: Stir in the tomato paste and the paprika. Cook for 5 more minutes.\n5 Pur\xc3\xa9e half the soup: Remove the bay leaves. Using an immersion blender, pur\xc3\xa9e most of the soup. You don't want the soup to be perfectly smooth, but you want to pur\xc3\xa9e enough of it so that the beans create a creamy base.\nAdd more salt and pepper to taste.\nGarnish with crumbled cooked bacon and chopped parsley to serve.\nHello!

b'Print\nSour Cream and Bacon Deviled Eggs Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 30 minutes\nI use granulated garlic in this recipe because it mixes better into the egg yolk mixture and it doesn\xe2\x80\x99t have the raw bite of freshly minced garlic. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have granulated garlic or garlic powder on hand, I would mix in 1/2 to 1 full tablespoon of minced onions instead.\nINGREDIENTS\n12 large eggs\n1/2 cup full-fat sour cream\n1 to 2 teaspoons Dijon mustard\n1/2 teaspoon kosher salt\n1/4 to 1/2 teaspoon granulated garlic\n3 to 4 strips of bacon\n1 1/2 tablespoons chopped chives\nGround paprika, to garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Steam the eggs: Fill a pot with 1 to 1 1/2 inches of water. Place a steamer basket inside and bring water to a boil. Once the water boils, turn off the heat. Carefully place 6 eggs into the steamer basket. Cover the pot and return the heat to medium-high. Let the eggs steam for 15 minutes.\nUsing a slotted spoon, remove the eggs and place them in a bowl of ice cold water. Repeat with steaming the remaining 6 eggs. (Get the step-by-step tutorial for making steam-cooked eggs here.)\n2 Let the eggs sit in the ice water for 30 minutes: You may need to add more ice cubes if the heat from the first batch of cooked eggs melts the ice cubes and warms the water.\n3 Peel the eggs and slice each egg in half. Scoop out the egg yolks and place them in a bowl.\n4 Make the deviled egg filling: Using a fork, smash the yolks into small pieces. Add the sour cream, mustard, salt and granulated garlic and mix until you get a smooth mixture. Taste the filling and adjust the seasonings to your liking. Set the filling aside as you cook the bacon.\n5 Cook the bacon: Heat a frying pan over medium heat and cook the bacon to your desired level of crispiness. I usually cook mine for 5 to 6 minutes, until I see some browning on the bacon strips.\nUse tongs to remove the bacon from pan and onto a plate lined with paper towels. Let the bacon cool for a few minutes. Once the bacon is cool enough to handle, chop or crumble bacon strips into small pieces.\n6 Fill the deviled eggs: Fill a zip-top sandwich bag with the egg yolk mixture. Snip off one of the bottom corners and pipe the egg yolk mixture into the egg white halves. If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a sandwich or piping bag on hand, you can also just spoon in the egg yolk mixture into the egg white halves.\n7 Sprinkle each egg with chives, paprika, and bacon bits. Serve immediately. Deviled eggs can also be refrigerated for a few hours before serving, but are best served the day they are made.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nBacon-Wrapped Shrimp Recipe\nPrep time: 20 minutesCook time: 10 minutesBrining time (optional) time: 30 minutesYield: Makes 12 pieces\nYou'll need about 1 strip of bacon for every 2 shrimp.\nI highly recommend brining the shrimp first. The brine will help keep the shrimp from drying out in the time it takes for the bacon to cook.\nIf grilling, I recommend using long, flat skewers which make turning the shrimp on the grill easier. If you don't have flat skewers, I've used two thin bamboo skewers (soaked in water for 30 minutes beforehand) to the same effect.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the brine (optional, but recommended):\n1/4 cup (Diamond Crystal) kosher salt (if using Morton's kosher salt, use only 3 tablespoons)\n1/4 cup sugar\n4 cups water\n1 cup ice\nFor the bacon-wrapped shrimp:\n1 pound (12 to 20 count), raw, peeled and deveined shrimp (tail on)\n2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil\nZest from 1 lime\n2 tablespoons lime juice\n1/2 teaspoon chipotle powder or chili powder (less or more to taste)\n6 to 10 strips thin bacon, cut in half (half as many pieces of bacon as there are shrimp)\nSpecial equipment:\nSkewers (for grilling) or toothpicks (for oven)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Brine the shrimp (optional, but recommended): Whisk the salt, sugar, and water until the salt and sugar dissolve. Add the ice and the shrimp, and let sit for 30 minutes (no longer). Remove the shrimp from the brine.\n2 Prepare grill or preheat oven: Prepare grill on high, direct heat (if grilling) or preheat the oven to 400\xc2\xb0F. If grilling and using thin bamboo or wood skewers, soak them in water first for 30 minutes.\n3 Season the shrimp: Mix together in a small bowl the lime zest, lime juice, olive oil, and chipotle powder. Stir the shrimp into the lime chipotle mixture; make sure each piece is well coated.\n4 Partially cook the bacon: Spread the bacon pieces out over several layers of paper towels on a microwave-safe plate. Cover with another layer of paper towel. Microwave on high until the bacon fat begins to melt but the bacon is still somewhat pliable, about 1 1/2 to 2 minutes.\n5 Wrap the shrimp with bacon: Working one at a time, wrap a half piece of partially cooked bacon around each piece of shrimp.\n6 Prep the shrimp for cooking: If you are grilling, thread the shrimp onto skewers.\nIf you are using the oven, secure each the bacon onto the shrimp with toothpicks. Place the bacon-wrapped shrimp on a foil-lined baking pan. Brush remaining lime chipotle mixture on the outside of the bacon-wrapped shrimp.\n7 Grill or bake the shrimp: Grill uncovered for 3 minutes on each side (less or more time depending on the heat of your grill), or bake in the 400\xc2\xb0F oven for 8 to 11 minutes, or until the bacon is lightly browned and the shrimp is cooked through.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nGoat Cheese Bacon Pops Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesYield: 1 dozen pops\nRegular sliced bacon is better than thick-cut bacon for this recipe since it crumbles more easily, but thick-cut is also fine if that\'s what you normally buy.\nPackages of goat cheese sometimes go by the name "chevre" in the store. Either is fine.\nINGREDIENTS\n6 slices bacon\n4 ounces goat cheese\n4 ounces cream cheese (lower fat is fine here, if you prefer)\n1 tablespoon mild honey\nPinch dried chili flakes (optional)\n1/3 cup dried cherries (cranberries, blueberries, or other tart dried fruit works well, too)\n1/2 cup lightly packed fresh herbs (I used parsley and chives)\n1/2 cup unsalted pecan halves\nSpecial equipment:\nAppetizer skewers\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the bacon: In a skillet over medium heat, cook the bacon until crispy. Drain on a paper towel. This can be done several days in advance; store in the fridge until needed.\n2 Make the cheese mix: In a food processor, combine goat cheese, cream cheese, honey, chili flakes (if using), a pinch of salt and a pinch of pepper. Blitz for about 30 seconds, then scrape down the sides of the bowl and pulse a few more times to fully combine. Transfer to a small bowl and freeze for 10 to 20 minutes, until firm but not frozen solid. (The cheese can be mixed up to 2 days in advance; store in the fridge.)\n3 Make the bacon topping: While the cheese mix is chilling, clean your food processor to make your filling. Place the dried cherries in the food processor and blend in 1-second pulses until they\xe2\x80\x99re chopped into tiny bits. Add herbs and pulse another 5 or so times. Add bacon and pecans and pulse until the mixture looks crumbly. Do not over-mix or you will end up with bacony nut butter. Transfer coating to a bowl.\n4 Roll the cheese into balls: Remove the cheese mixture from the freezer and roll into twelve little balls (a scant tablespoon each). Wetting your hands in cool water helps to cut down on the mess.\n5 Roll the cheese balls in the bacon topping: Gently press the coating into the cheese to make it stick.\n6 Stick a small stick or skewer into your cheese balls and store in the fridge until you\xe2\x80\x99re ready to serve. The pops are best the day they are made, but will keep just fine in the fridge for several hours before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Print\nBaked Potato Soup Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesYield: Serves 4 to 6\nPotatoes love salt, so if you are using homemade stock or low sodium stock that isn't well seasoned, you'll need to add more to this soup to make up the difference.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 pounds russet potatoes (about 7 medium potatoes)\n1/4 pound thick sliced bacon, cut crosswise into 1/8-inch slices (lardons)\n1 large onion, finely chopped (about 2 cups)\n2 ribs celery, finely chopped\n6 cups chicken stock\n1 teaspoon kosher salt (more to taste)\n1/8 teaspoon of ground white or black pepper\n2 to 4 tablespoons heavy cream (optional)\nGarnishes:\nGrated sharp cheddar cheese\nSour cream\nMinced chives\nCrumbled bacon (from step 2 in method)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Bake the potatoes: Scrub the potatoes clean and poke them all over with the tines of a fork or paring knife (this is so they don't explode from internal pressure building up as they cook). Place on a foil lined baking sheet and bake at 400\xc2\xb0F for 1 hour, or until easily cut through with a knife.\nRemove and let cool enough to handle. (To speed up cooling, slice them in half lengthwise.)\n2 Cook the bacon: Place bacon lardons in a large, thick bottomed Dutch oven (about 5 to 6 quart pot). Heat on medium high until the bacon starts to brown then lower the heat to medium.\nCook until the bacon has rendered most of its fat and the lardons are browned and crispy. Remove the cooked bacon and set aside.\nRemove all but 1 tablespoon of bacon fat from the pan. (Do not discard bacon fat in your sink, it will clog the drain. Pour the fat into a jar and let it cool and solidify. Then either scoop it out and discard it or use it for another purpose.)\n3 Cook onion and celery in the bacon fat: Add the chopped onion and celery to the remaining bacon fat in the pot. Cook for 2 minutes on medium high, then lower the heat to low, and cover the pot. Let cook slowly on low heat for 15 to 20 minutes.\n4 Scoop out baked potatoes, add it and chicken stock to pot: When potatoes are cool enough to handle, scoop out the insides to a bowl. Then add it to the cooked onion and celery mixture along with 6 cups chicken stock. Add a teaspoon of kosher salt.\nBring the soup to a simmer and reduce the heat to low.\nUse a potato masher to mash the potatoes into the stock.\n5 Pur\xc3\xa9e some or all of the soup: Cook the potato soup for about 5 minutes, then use an immersion blender to pur\xc3\xa9e about half of the soup if you want a slightly chunky soup, or pur\xc3\xa9e all of it if you want a smoother soup.\n6 Add cream: Stir 2 to 4 tablespoons of heavy cream into the soup if you want a creamier soup. Add more salt and pepper to taste.\n7 Top with grated cheddar, sour cream, chives, bacon: Pour into bowls and top with grated cheddar, sour cream, chives, and crumbled crispy bacon.\nHello!

b'Save It Print\nBrussels Sprouts with Bacon and Chestnuts Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 6-8 as a side\nChestnuts are delicious, but a major pain to roast and shell (have you ever exploded chestnuts all over your kitchen? I have). Canned (jarred more like it) chestnuts actually work better in recipes than the kind you roast and peel yourself. The texture and moisture content is more consistent. So, we suggest using canned roasted chestnuts for this recipe. You can of course roast and shell your own if you prefer.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound Brussels sprouts\n1/3 pound thick-sliced bacon or slab bacon, cut into 1/4-inch pieces or batons\n1 red onion, chopped\n20-25 canned roasted chestnuts, quartered or roughly chopped\n1/4 cup chicken stock\nSalt and pepper to taste\nLemon wedges to serve\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the Brussels sprouts: Cut the Brussels sprouts in half and slice thinly, starting at the top of the sprout and working back toward the stem. Discard the hard tip of the stem side.\n2 Cook the bacon: Cut the bacon into pieces about 1/4 inch wide and put them in a large saut\xc3\xa9 pan over medium heat.\nWhen the bacon is browned, remove with a slotted spoon and set aside.\n3 Cook the onions in bacon fat, add back the bacon:  Remove all but 1 tablespoon of the bacon fat (do not put down the drain, see how to render bacon fat). Turn up the heat to high, add the red onions. Cook until the onions begin to brown, add back the bacon.\n5 Add chestnuts, Brussels sprouts, stock: Add the chestnuts and Brussels sprouts to the saut\xc3\xa9 pan with the bacon and onions. Add the chicken stock and toss to combine. Stir in about 1 teaspoon of salt, more or less to taste. Cook over high heat for 3-4 minutes. Add pepper to taste.\nServe hot with lemon wedges.

Then poach the eggs while the pasta is cooking. It all comes together in about 20 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\n2 tablespoons white vinegar, for poaching the eggs\n12 ounces (3/4 box) spaghetti\n6 slices (about 5 ounces) thick cut bacon, cut into 1/2-inch dice\n2 cloves garlic, thinly sliced\n7 to 8 (12 ounces) small (1 1/2-inch) tomatoes, quartered\n4 large eggs\n1/2 cup freshly grated Parmesan\n1/2 cup packed basil leaves, torn into pieces\nFreshly ground black pepper, to taste\nOlive oil, for garnish\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Bring two pans of water to a boil: For the pasta, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil (at least 4 quarts of water and 2 tablespoons of salt). For the eggs, fill a wide saucepan with 2 inches of salted water and bring to a boil. Add the vinegar to the saucepan for the eggs.\n2 Cook the bacon, garlic, and tomatoes while the water heats: In a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high heat, cook the bacon until browned. Transfer to plate.\nAdd the garlic and the tomatoes, and cook, stirring often, for 2 minutes, or just until the garlic turns pale golden and the tomatoes soften slightly. Remove the pan from the heat.\n3 Cook the spaghetti: Add the spaghetti to the large pot of boiling water, and cook for 8 to 9 minutes, or until al dente. Remove 1 cup of the pasta water with a measuring cup.\n4 Poach the eggs while the pasta cooks: Line a tray or plate with a paper towel. Adjust the heat under the saucepan so that the poaching water barely simmers.\nCrack 1 egg into a small bowl or cup and, holding the rim as close to the surface of the water as possible, drop the egg into the water.\nRapidly repeat with the remaining eggs.\nDrag a wooden spoon around the edge of the pot to stir the water and gently release the eggs from the bottom.\nAfter 2 minutes, lift 1 egg from the water with a slotted spoon and test for doneness by pressing on the egg. The white should feel firm and the yolk should still be soft. Return to the water if necessary to complete the cooking. With a slotted spoon, transfer the eggs to the paper towel lined plate to drain the water.\n5 Assemble the pasta: Set the skillet with the garlic and tomatoes back over low heat. With tongs, add the cooked spaghetti. Add the cooked bacon, Parmesan, basil, salt, and pepper and toss together. If the spaghetti looks dry, add some of the reserved pasta water a few tablespoons at a time.\n6 To serve: Divide the spaghetti among 4 plates or shallow bowls and top each with a poached egg.

We added them because, why not? Tastes good. Also we halved the recipe, because for everyday meals we don't need to serve 10 to 12. Feel free to double to Ree's original Thanksgiving-worthy proportions.\nThis recipe also works well in the slow cooker, so I've added instructions for that as well.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 slices thick cut bacon (about 4 ounces), cut into 1-inch segments\n1/2 large onion, diced (about 3/4 cup)\n1 clove garlic, minced\n1 pounds of fresh, firm green beans (they should break when you bend them, not bend like a rubber band), stem ends trimmed\n1 14.5-ounce can whole tomatoes\n1 large sprig fresh thyme\nSalt\nFreshly ground black pepper\n1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon of cayenne\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook the bacon until fat begins to render: Place the bacon pieces on the bottom of a large, thick-bottomed pot. Heat on medium heat for several minutes until the bacon fat begins to render.\n2 Add onions, then garlic: Add the chopped onions to the bacon. Cook a few minutes until the onions are translucent. Add the garlic (if using) and cook a minute more. Drain off any excess fat.\n3 Add green beans, tomatoes, spices: Add the green beans to the pot. Add the whole, peeled, canned tomatoes and their juices. Add a sprig of thyme to the pot (if using). Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and cayenne.\n4 Cover and simmer: Cover the pot and lower the heat to low. Simmer for 45 minutes to 1 hour, until the beans are cooked through and tender, stirring occasionally.\nSlow Cooker Instructions If you want to use a slow cooker for step 4, you can easily do so. Just put the cooked bacon and onions from steps 1 and 2, and the beans, tomatoes and spices into a slow cooker and cook on high for 2 to 3 hours, depending on your slow cooker, until the beans are completely tender and the tomatoes have broken down.\nServe!\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nHow to Render Bacon Fat\nCook time: 10 minutes\nIf you make more bacon fat than you end up using, just throw out the whole jar and start a new one.\nNever pour bacon fat down the drain! It will solidify as it cools and clog your drain. Either soak it up with paper towels and discard or pour the rendered bacon fat into a jar to save.\nINGREDIENTS\nStrips of raw bacon\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Cook bacon on medium low heat: Heat a large skillet on medium-low heat. Lay out several strips of raw bacon. Let the strips cook for 10 or 15 minutes, turning them occasionally.\nWhen the bacon strips are nicely browned and crispy, use tongs or a fork to lift them out of the pan and place them on paper towels (to absorb the excess fat) on a plate.\n2 Pour remaining fat into a jar: Pour the remaining fat in the pan into a jar, and put the jar into your refrigerator. The bacon grease will solidify to a slightly off-color white. When you cook bacon again, pull out the jar and add more of the excess fat to it.\nIf you want, you can strain out the solid bacon bits before pouring the fat into a jar. I find that these bits have plenty of flavor, so I don't bother to strain them.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission.

This helps make it easier to mix with the other ingredients.\nDepending on the size of your peppers and how much you stuff them, you may have some leftover filling. This makes a great spread for crackers or made into sandwiches! \nOven Directions: Arrange the poppers on a baking sheet and roast at 425F until the cheese filling is hot and bubbly and the jalape\xc3\xb1os are tender, 10 to 15 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the bacon:\n12 ounces (8 to 12 slices) thick-cut smoked bacon\n1 1/2 tablespoons barbecue sauce\nFor the filling:\n8 ounces plain cream cheese, softened to room temperature\n1 cup (about 3 ounces) coarsely shredded sharp cheddar cheese\n1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh chives\n1 large clove garlic, minced\n2 tablespoons barbecue sauce\n12 medium-sized jalape\xc3\xb1os\nExtra minced fresh chives to garnish\n1 cup sour cream, to serve (optional)\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xbaF. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Lay a few layers of paper towels on top of a cooling rack and place near the oven.\n2 Glaze and bake the bacon until crispy: Arrange the bacon in a single layer on the baking sheet. Brush with 1 1/2 tablespoons of barbecue sauce.\nTransfer to the oven and bake until crisp and caramelized, 15 to 20 minutes (begin checking around 15 minutes; the bacon could take up to 20 minutes to fully crisp depending on the brand and thickness).\nRemove the bacon from oven and drain for a few minutes on paper towels, then transfer to a plate to finish cooling. The pieces will stick to the paper towels if left for too long.\n3 While bacon cooks, prepare the filling: Combine cream cheese, cheddar cheese, chives, garlic and barbecue sauce in a small mixing bowl.\n4 Prepare the jalape\xc3\xb1o peppers: Wear gloves for this step if you are sensitive to pepper heat. Cut the jalape\xc3\xb1os in half lengthwise. Use a spoon to scoop out the seeds. You can leave the stems on (they make nice handles for eating!) or trim them off.\nArrange all the jalape\xc3\xb1os cut-side up on a platter or baking sheet.\n5 Stuff the peppers: Chop or crumble the bacon into small bits, then fold into the cream cheese mixture. Using a spoon, fill each of the jalape\xc3\xb1o halves with a big dollop of the cream cheese mixture, mounding slightly.\nAt this point, the poppers can be covered and refrigerated until ready to grill, up to 24 hours.\n6 Prepare your grill: For gas grills, heat the grill with the burners set to high and preheat for 10 minutes. When ready to grill, reduce the burners to medium.\nFor charcoal grills, fill a grill chimney with charcoal and light it. When the coals are hot (they should be covered with a layer of fine gray ash) empty the coals into the grill and push them to one side of the grill to make higher heat and lower heat cooking zones. Set the grate in place and cover the grill. Preheat the grate for 5 minutes.\n7 Grill the poppers: Brush grill grates with oil to prevent sticking. If you're using a charcoal grill, cook over the low-heat cooking zone.\nUsing tongs, place the poppers on the grill so they lay across the grates and don't fall through. If any of the poppers is leaning to the side, prop it up against a neighbor so the cheese filling doesn't start to melt out as the poppers cook.\nGrill until the poppers are seared on the bottoms and the cheese filling is hot and bubbling around the edges, about 10 minutes. Be careful of overcooking or the peppers will become too soft.\n8 Serve the poppers right away: Using tongs and a spatula in tandem to scoop up the poppers, remove from the grill and transfer to a platter. Serve immediately alongside sour cream, if desired. Discard the stems as you eat.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b"Save It Print\nGrilled Bacon-Wrapped Stuffed Hot Dogs Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 11 minutesYield: Makes 4 stuffed hot dogs\nRecipe adapted from Mastering the Grill: The Owner's Manual for Outdoor Cooking by Andrew Schloss and David Joachim.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 teaspoon ketchup\n1 teaspoon Dijon mustard\n4 large hot dogs, knockwurst, or kielbasa\n1/2 ounce cheddar cheese, cut into long sticks\n2 tablespoons chopped onions\n1 cup prepared sauerkraut, drained, roughly chopped\n4 slices bacon\nVegetable oil\n4 long hot dog buns\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare your grill for direct medium high heat.\n2 Slice open the hot dogs: Mix together the ketchup and mustard in a small bowl. In a separate bowl, mix the sauerkraut with the chopped onion, set aside.\nSlice open the hot dogs, down the center, lengthwise, forming a deep pocket in each, but not cutting all the way through.\nCoat the inside of each hot dog with the mustard ketchup mixture.\n3 Stuff the hot dogs: Place a strip of cheese deep within the pocket of each hot dog. Top with sauerkraut and onions.\nEncapsulate the cheese at the ends with the sauerkraut mixture as well, so that no cheese is exposed (otherwise it will drip out when cooking).\n4 Wrap bacon around each hot dog: Wrap a strip of bacon around each stuffed hot dog, securing with toothpicks at each end.\nMake sure you wrap tight enough so that the stuffing stays in, but not so tight so that when the hot dog expands will cooking the bacon would tear.\n5 Grill the hot dogs: Brush the grates of your grill with vegetable oil so that the hot dogs don't stick. If you have a grill screen (a screen with smaller holes so that small pieces of whatever you're cooking don't fall through the grill), you can use it, just coat it with vegetable oil first and pre-heat for a couple of minutes.\nPlace the stuffed hot dogs on the grill, stuffing side down. Grill for 2 minutes, until the bacon on that side is cooked, turn the hot dogs a quarter turn and grill for a couple more minutes.\nContinue to grill for a few minutes each on all sides until the bacon is cooked. Cover the grill in between turnings to help with the cooking.\n6 Grill the buns: During the last minute of cooking, open up the hot dog buns and place them open-side down on the grill to lightly toast.\n7 Serve: Remove the hot dogs and buns from the grill. Remove the toothpicks from the hot dogs. Place the hot dogs in the buns and serve.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

(If you are using a stovetop pressure cooker, use medium heat.)\nLet the bacon cook until it has rendered some fat and begun to brown a bit, about 7 minutes. Add the onions and saut\xc3\xa9 until softened and translucent, about 3 more minutes.\n2 Stir in the rest of the ingredients and pressure cook: Add the green beans, diced tomatoes and their liquid, water, salt, pepper, cayenne, and thyme. Give everything a good stir so all of the green beans are coated with some of the cooking liquid.\nSecure the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure that the pressure regulator is set to the \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d position. Cancel the \xe2\x80\x9cSaut\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d program on the pressure cooker, then select the \xe2\x80\x9cManual\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cPressure Cook\xe2\x80\x9d setting.

b"Save It Print\nPasta with Butternut Squash, Bacon, and Brown Butter Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 4 to 6 servings\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound butternut squash, cut into 1/2-inch cubes (about 4 cups)\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1 teaspoon Morton\xe2\x80\x99s kosher salt\n1/2 teaspoon freshly cracked black pepper\n1 pound pasta, such as penne, rigatoni, or other short-shaped pasta\n8 ounces bacon (7 to 8 slices, depending on how thickly they are cut)\n1/4 cup sliced shallots\n1 stick unsalted butter (4 ounces/8 tablespoons)\n4 to 5 sage leaves\n1/4 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Roast the squash: Preheat the oven to 425\xc2\xb0F. On a rimmed baking sheet, combine the squash with olive oil, salt, and pepper on a rimmed baking sheet, and toss to coat.\nRoast for 20 minutes, tossing half way through to evenly brown. When it\xe2\x80\x99s ready, the squash will be soft and some of the edges will have browned.\n2 Cook the pasta: Meanwhile, bring a large pot of salted water to boil and cook the pasta to al dente, or according to package directions. Drain well and set aside.\n3 Fry the bacon: In a large, deep skillet (I used cast iron), put the bacon in a cold pan and cook over medium heat until crispy. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels.\n4 Cook the shallots: Place the skillet back on the stove, but with the heat turned off. Drain all but about 2 tablespoons of the bacon grease.\nAdd the shallots and cook in the residual heat from the skillet; this helps prevent the shallots from burning. If they don\xe2\x80\x99t seem to be cooking fast enough, turn the heat to medium-low and cook for just a couple of minutes until they start to soften and become aromatic. Transfer the cooked shallots to a large bowl.\n  5 Combine the bacon, shallots, squash and pasta: After the bacon cools, cut it into small pieces using kitchen scissors (or using a chef's knife), and combine with the shallots in a large bowl\xe2\x80\x94or you can use the stockpot you cooked the pasta in (I like to do this if it's just me and the boys).\nAdd the pasta and toss to combine. When the squash comes out of the oven, add the squash to this bowl and toss gently together.\n  6 Brown the butter: In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Stir it constantly and keep an eye on it so it does not burn. (See here for full instructions on how to brown butter.) It will start to crackle, foam, and smell nutty. The color will deepen to a caramel/amber hue.\nAround when the butter stops foaming\xe2\x80\x94or at least it starts to subside\xe2\x80\x94and the butter turns slightly brown, add the sage leaves.\nRemove the saucepan from the heat as soon as the sage leaves start to curl. Pour the butter and the sage leaves into the bowl with the rest of the ingredients.\n  7 Combine all ingredients and serve: Toss everything gently together with a wooden spoon. Taste and add salt and/or pepper if needed. Serve immediately with freshly grated cheese over the top.\nIf you are feeling extra decadent, add a chunk of unsalted butter or a splash of extra virgin olive oil on top when you toss, or some of the reserved bacon grease.\nLeftovers keep for about 2 to 3 days and reheat fairly well. I like to add a bit of olive oil or water to the pot when I reheat it over low heat. (I try to avoid microwaving leftover pasta because it just makes it gummy.)\nHello!

If you boil or steam the corn ears after you've already husked them, or if you cook them in the microwave, reduce the cooking time by a few minutes.\n2 Remove the corn kernels from the cobs: To remove the kernels from the cobs, stand a corn cob vertically with the tip on a small bowl that is inverted inside a larger, shallow bowl.\nUse a sharp knife to make long, downward strokes, removing the kernels from the cob, as you work your way around the cob.\nNote: it may help to work over a low table, to be in a better ergonomic position to cut the cobs this way.\n3 Make the dressing: In a separate bowl, whisk together the oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, and cumin.\n4 Assemble the salad: In a medium sized bowl, mix together the corn, chopped arugula, bacon, and onions.\nMix dressing into salad just before serving.

I\'ve brought back the bacon gremolata yet again because it pairs so nicely with the roasted cabbage. I hope you and your guests find as much joy and pleasure in this simple recipe as we do."\nAdapted from Dishing Up the Dirt by Andrea Bemis, copyright \xc2\xa9 2017. Published by Harper Wave, an imprint of Harper Collins Publishers.\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the cabbage:\n1 medium-sized head of cabbage (about 1 1/2 pounds)\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon salt\nFreshly ground black pepper\nFor the bacon gremolata:\n3/4 cup roasted unsalted almonds\n4 strips (about 1/4 pound) good-quality thick-cut bacon\n3 tablespoons minced fresh parsley\n1 teaspoon freshly grated lemon zest\nPinch of kosher salt\nTo serve:\nFreshly grated Parmesan cheese\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Heat the oven to 400F. Arrange two oven racks in the upper and lower third of the oven.\n2 Slice the cabbage: Peel off one or two of the thin, limp outer layers of the cabbage. Trim the stem so that it is flush with the bottom of the cabbage (if it isn\'t already).\nSet the cabbage upright and slice into 1-inch thick slices. Don\'t worry if a few of the outer layers unfurl or fall away.\n3 Brush the cabbage slices with olive oil: Use a pastry brush to cover both sides of the cabbage slices with olive oil, or use your fingers to rub the oil in. Season both sides with a little salt and pepper.\n4 Roast the cabbage: Arrange the cabbage slices in a single layer on a baking sheet. Roast on the lower oven rack for 35 to 45 minutes, flipping the slices halfway through cooking.\nWhen done, both sides should be seared an even golden-brown with crispy edges and the center of the slices should be tender.\n5 While the cabbage is roasting, prepare the bacon gremolata. If using unroasted almonds, arrange them on another sheet pan and roast in the upper part of the oven for about 10 minutes, until toasted and fragrant. Remove from the oven, cool briefly, then finely chop using a chef\'s knife (or pulse a few times in a food processor, but be careful not to over process or you\'ll make almond butter!)\nCook the bacon in a skillet over medium heat until very crispy. Transfer to a plate lined with paper towels to drain. When cool, roughly chop.\nCombine the chopped almonds, chopped bacon, minced parsley, lemon zest, and a pinch of kosher salt in a small mixing bowl. Toss to combine and set aside. (This bacon gremolata can be prepared ahead and kept refrigerated in an airtight container for about a week.)\n6 To serve: As soon as the cabbage slices are done roasting, transfer to a serving platter or individual plates. Sprinkle with a few spoonfuls of bacon gremolata and grated Parmesan cheese. Serve warm.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Lay the strips of bacon in a single layer on the pan. Slowly cook the bacon, rendering out the fat, until lightly browned on one side. Using a fork or tongs, turn the strips of bacon over to cook the other side.\nWhen the bacon strips are sufficiently cooked remove from pan and place on a plate lined with a paper towel to absorb the excess fat.\nPour out excess fat from the pan (leaving about half a teaspoon in the pan) into a jar or a container to either dispose of or to store. (Never pour bacon grease down the sink, it will clog your pipes.)\n2 Wilt the arugula: In the same pan, add handfuls of fresh baby arugula or watercress. Toss in the remaining remaining fat. As soon as the greens start to wilt, remove from heat and remove from the pan to stop the cooking.\n3 Toast bread, build sandwich: Toast bread slices in a toaster. Spread mayonnaise (or your favorite spread, butter will do too) over the slices. Layer the sandwich with bacon, sliced tomato, and lightly wilted arugula. Cut on the diagonal.\nEat immediately.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

Just cut into thick rounds, coat with olive oil, and grill for about 5 minutes per side. Then chop.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/4 pound thick cut bacon\n1/2 large red onion, chopped, about 1 cup\n2 cups finely chopped fresh pineapple (about 10 oz)\n1/4 cup chopped sweet pickles\n1 Tbsp sweet pickle juice\n8 hot dogs\n8 hot dog buns\nMETHOD\n1 Pre-cook the bacon: Place the strips of bacon in a skillet on medium heat. Slowly cook the bacon, turning the strips over occasionally until much of the fat is rendered and the bacon is lightly browned. Remove the bacon strips to a paper towel lined plate.\n2 Saut\xc3\xa9 the onions: Pour off all but a teaspoon of the bacon fat (do this into a jar, do not pour down the drain or you will clog your pipes). Increase the heat to medium high and add the chopped onion. Cook, stirring occasionally until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat.\nWhile the onions are cooking, finely chop the cooled bacon strips.\n3 Make pineapple bacon relish: In a large bowl stir to combine the bacon, onion, pineapple, and sweet pickles. Mix in a tablespoon of sweet pickle juice. You can make ahead at this point, chill until ready to serve with the hot dogs.\n4 Cook the hot dogs: Heat the hot dogs your favorite way. The hot dogs are already cooked when you buy them, so all you really need to do is heat them through.\nOver a grill, grill for about 5 minutes on a medium flame, until lightly browned, and toast the buns for a minute if you wish.\nOr, put the dogs in a saucepan and cover with water. Bring to a simmer and simmer for 5 minutes.\nOr, pierce the hot dogs all over with a fork and put on a plate in the microwave for 20 to 30 seconds per hot dog.\n5 Assemble: Place a hot dog in a bun and top with a couple spoonfuls of relish.\nHello!

Turn the heat to medium and cook, turning frequently, until the bacon is crisp, 5 to 10 minutes. Lay on a paper towel-lined plate to drain. When the bacon is cool enough to handle, crumble it and set it aside.\n2 Scoop and mash the avocados: Cut the avocados in half pole-to-pole and twist them open. Remove the pit. (See How to Cut and Peel and Avocado.) With a large spoon, scoop the avocado flesh into a medium bowl. Mash it with a large fork until it\xe2\x80\x99s chunky-smooth.\n3 Add the seasonings: Add 2 teaspoons vinegar, the garlic powder, and the hot pepper sauce; mix well.

b"Save It Print\nOven-Baked Bacon\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: 12 strips\nIf you use thick-cut bacon, plan to cook for an extra 5 to 10 minutes.\nINGREDIENTS\n12 strips bacon\n1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\nWire baking rack\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the bacon: If you have an oven-safe baking rack, place it inside a sheet pan. (For even easier clean-up, you can also line the sheet pan with foil.)\nLay out the bacon strips on the wire rack. Make sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t overlap. Sprinkle bacon strips with black pepper, if you want.\n2 Bake the bacon: Place the bacon in a cold oven, and set the oven temperature to 375\xc2\xb0F. Bake the bacon in the oven for 15-20 minutes total.\nIf you are doing more than one pan of bacon, rotate sheet pans from top to bottom halfway through. If you are not using a baking rack, flip the bacon strips halfway through cooking.\nStart checking the bacon around 18 minutes, as some bacon cooks faster depending on the fat content. The bacon is done when it turns a dark tan color. Remember that the bacon crisps up as it cools, so don't worry if it's not completely crispy when you take it out of the oven.\n3 Drain and cool: When the bacon comes out of the oven, place it on a few paper towels to drain and cool. If you like, pour off the bacon grease from the pan and save it for cooking. (I love to cook eggs in my bacon grease!)\n4 Store the bacon: Bacon can be kept in the fridge for a few days and reheats well in a skillet over low heat. You can also freeze the bacon if you made a big batch. Just make sure to freeze the strips individually, or in between pieces of parchment paper, so they don't stick together.\nHello!

b"Print\nHow to Make Candied Bacon\nPrep time: 5 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: 12 strips, serves 4 to 6\nThis recipe is easily doubled. Space the bacon as closely together as you can on the two baking sheets. It's okay if they touch in places, but don't let them overlap.\nMAPLE BACON ALTERNATIVE: As an alternative to the standard recipe, stir two tablespoons of maple syrup into the brown sugar and brush this onto the bacon before baking. Bake just as you would the normal version.\nINGREDIENTS\n12 strips bacon (not thick-cut, about one pound)\n1/4 cup light brown sugar\n1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\n2 baking sheets\n2 oven-safe wire racks\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prep the bacon: Preheat oven to 375\xc2\xb0 F with one rack in the top third and another rack in the bottom third of the oven. Line two baking sheets with foil, and place an oven-safe wire rack on each. Lay out the bacon strips perpendicular to the lines on the wire rack, divided between the two pans and making sure they don\xe2\x80\x99t overlap. (If you lay them out parallel to the rack, the bacon may fall through the cracks while cooking!)\nSprinkle the bacon strips with brown sugar and (optionally) add some freshly ground black pepper. I like to use about 1 teaspoon of brown sugar per bacon strip, spreading it out along the length of the strip.\n2 Bake the candied bacon: Bake the bacon in the oven for 20 to 25 minutes. I recommend rotating the pans once during baking to ensure the bacon is cooking evenly. Start checking the bacon around 18 minutes, as some slices will cook faster, depending on the fat content and thickness of the slices.\nThe bacon is done when the brown sugar is melted and the bacon is a deep brown color. Remember that the bacon will continue to crisp up as it cools, so don\xe2\x80\x99t worry if it\xe2\x80\x99s not completely crispy now.\n3 Cool the bacon: Let the bacon cool right on the wire rack for a few minutes. (If you eat it right away, you'll burn your mouth on the molten sugar.) The bacon will crisp up as it cools and as the melted sugar hardens. Then serve!\n4 Store the bacon: Candied bacon can be kept in the fridge for a few days and reheats well in a skillet over low heat.\nI don\xe2\x80\x99t think candied bacon is worth freezing, although if you made a huge batch you absolutely could. You could just want to make sure to freeze the strips individually so they didn\xe2\x80\x99t stick together.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Let them sit for 20 minutes to reconstitute. Drain the figs and cut off the stems. Cut a small slit in each fig and spoon in a little blue cheese or goat cheese, or half an almond, if desired. You could also do a mix of fillings.\n2 Wrap the bacon around the figs: Cut the strips of bacon in half and trim them down to about 1/2 to 3/4 inches wide. Wrap one bacon strip around each fig. Secure with a toothpick.\n3 Air fry the figs: Spray the basket of your air fryer with nonstick spray. Add bacon-wrapped figs in a single layer so they aren\xe2\x80\x99t touching. Air fry the figs at 350\xcb\x9aF for 8-9 minutes, flipping once halfway through.\nIf you don\xe2\x80\x99t have an air fryer, broil the figs on high for about 3 minutes per side.\n4 Serve the figs: Once the figs have cooled slightly, serve them drizzled with honey.\nLeftover figs (yeah right!) will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days.

Make a good-sized divot in the mushrooms, but make sure to leave enough mushroom around the edges to hold the filling. Finely dice the stems and cored bits.\n3 Cook the bacon: Meanwhile, add bacon to a medium or large skillet over medium heat. Cook until bacon is browned and crispy, about 6 to 7 minutes. Remove the cooked bacon, leaving the grease, and chop into tiny bits.\n4 Cook the filling ingredients: Add the chopped mushroom cores, diced onions, and thyme to the skillet with the reserved bacon grease. Saut\xc3\xa9 the filling ingredients over medium heat until the onions are soft, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and stir in breadcrumbs and chopped bacon. Let cool.\n5 Add the gouda: After mixture has cooled slightly, stir in the grated gouda cheese.\n6 Stuff the mushrooms: Line up the cored mushrooms in a baking dish that has been lightly oiled to prevent sticking. Spoon about 2 heaping tablespoons of the filling into each mushroom, piling it high and packing it in. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if the mushrooms are almost overflowing. You should use all the filling!\n7 Bake the mushrooms: Bake the stuffed mushrooms for 20 minutes at 400\xcb\x9aF.

Toast croutons in a nonstick skillet over medium heat for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring occasionally. It\xe2\x80\x99s okay if the char on them becomes uneven. Some sides should be crunchy and some soft still. Remove and set aside.\n2 Cook the bacon: Add chopped bacon to a large pot over medium heat. Cook until fat renders out and bacon is crispy. Transfer the bacon to a plate lined with a paper towel and set aside as a topping for the soup. Reserve the bacon grease in the pot.\n3 Make the soup: Add onions, celery, carrots, and parsnips to pot. Season with salt and pepper and cook until vegetables soften, 3 to 4 minutes.\nStir in flour, cook for another minute, then add broth and milk. Slowly stir. Bring to a slight simmer, then add potatoes and simmer for about 15 minutes, or until potatoes are very tender.\n4 Blend half of the soup: When potatoes are very tender, remove half of the soup from the pot and let cool briefly. Blend until smooth and return to the pot, stirring it into the non-blended soup base.\nAlternatively, blend half the soup directly in the pot with an immersion blender; be careful not to over-blend! Some chunks are good. Taste the soup and adjust seasoning to your liking. Keep warm until serving.\n5 Serve: Serve the soup topped with fresh chives, crispy reserved bacon, and skillet croutons.\nLeftover soup keeps well in the fridge for up to a week, or you can freeze it for 3 months.

b'Save It Print\nLoaded Baked Potatoes Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4-6\nINGREDIENTS\n6-8 strips bacon\n6 medium-large russet potatoes, scrubbed well\n2 tablespoons olive oil\n1 teaspoon kosher salt\n1 pound fresh broccoli, cut into florets (or use frozen)\n8 ounces grated sharp cheddar cheese\nTo serve:\nSour cream\nFresh chives\nDad Add: Quick Home Fries (serves 2):\n1 baked potato, diced\n1 tablespoon olive oil\n1/2 teaspoon seasoned salt\nEggs, for serving\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare the bacon: Line a baking sheet with foil, then top with a wire baking rack (cookie cooling rack). Lay the bacon strips on the wire rack perpendicular to the wires, making sure the bacon pieces don\xe2\x80\x99t overlap.\n2 Bake the bacon and scrub the potatoes: Place the bacon in a cold oven and set the temperature to 375\xc2\xb0F. Bake for 15-20 minutes. Check the bacon around the 18-minute mark. Some types of bacon cook faster than others. (See How to Make Bacon in the Oven for full details.)\nWhile the bacon bakes, scrub potatoes well and then stab each potato about 10 times with a fork to prevent the possibility of a potato exploding in the oven. (It can happen!)\nRemove the bacon from the oven; transfer to a paper towel-lined plate.\n3 Bake the potatoes: Increase the heat to 400\xcb\x9aF. Place potatoes on a baking sheet, drizzle well with olive oil, and sprinkle with coarse salt. Bake potatoes for about an hour until the skins are shriveled slightly and the potatoes are very tender. (See How to Bake a Potato for more details.)\n4 Blanch the broccoli: While the potatoes bake, cook your broccoli. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add a big pinch of salt to the water to season it. Add broccoli to the water and boil for 3 minutes until the broccoli is just tender, but not mushy at all.\nDrain broccoli once it is tender and set aside for assembly. We will warm everything up once the potatoes are assembled at the end.\n5 Open the potatoes: Once your potatoes are baked, let them cool slightly so you can handle them. Cut each potato down the center, being careful not to cut all the way through. Then cut two perpendicular cuts near the end of each potato; this will allow you to open each potato up easier. I like to use a small paring knife to slice up the interior of the potato, making it easier to unfold and stuff.\n5 Stuff the potatoes: Sprinkle some cheese over the potato. I like a lot of cheese, but feel free to use as much or as little as you\xe2\x80\x99d like. Top with about 1/2 cup of cooked broccoli and 1 piece of crumbled bacon. Sprinkle the broccoli with more cheese and more broccoli or bacon depending on the size of the potato and the size of your appetite!\n6 Reheat the potatoes: Place the stuffed potato back in the oven for 5-10 minutes to really melt the cheese and warm the fillings.\n7 Serve: Top the warm potatoes with sour cream and chives and serve.\nLeftovers: Store any extra potatoes before filling them. Leftover potatoes can be used within a week for baked potatoes, loaded potatoes, or quick Dad Add home fries!\n8 How to Make Dad Add Home Fries: Cut a leftover potato into about 1/4-inch cubes. Into a medium skillet set over medium heat, add the olive oil. When the oil starts to shimmer, add the potato cubes and seasoned salt. Cook for 10-12 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the potatoes are crispy and browned on the edges. Remove from skillet and serve with eggs.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Use a hand mixer or a stand mixer to whip the goat cheese mixture until it has a smooth, light consistency. (If you don\xe2\x80\x99t have a hand mixer or stand mixer, you can use a fork to mash the ingredients together, but they won't have the same whipped consistency.)\nThe finished dip should be easily spreadable with a knife. If it is too thick or seems dry, add more milk by the tablespoon.\n2 Assemble the dip: Spread the whipped goat cheese in a thin, even layer along the bottom of a 2 1/2-quart baking dish or an 8x8 baking dish. It shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be more than 1/2-inch thick in any part of the dip.

If they don't taste good raw, believe me, they aren't going to taste good cooked.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 cups of peeled, sliced apples - use apples that cook up well, like Fuji or Jonagold\n3 Tbsp sugar\nA sprinkle of cinnamon\n1 Tbsp maple syrup\nMETHOD\n1 Sprinkle apples with cinnamon and sugar: Put apple slices in a glass bowl. Sprinkle on top the 3 Tbsp of sugar. Add a light sprinkle of cinnamon.\n2 Microwave on high for 5 minutes or more: Bake in microwave oven for 5 minutes on high heat. Adjust the time for your microwave and how many apples you are doing. Ours has a powerful high setting so 4 cups of apples only takes 5 minutes.\nIf you use more apples, you will probably need to cook it a little longer. I suggest starting with 5 minutes and testing for doneness with a fork. If it needs more cooking time, give it more.\n3 Add maple syrup to taste: When done, remove and mix so the sugar coats well all the apple pieces.

You don't have to (see this great Russ Parsons article in the LA Times about why you don't need to soak beans), but not doing so in this recipe will increase the cooking time. With the beans pre-soaked, they'll still take 8 hours to cook and soften in a slow-cooker. Once beans come in contact with the molasses, the sugar in the molasses will keep the beans firm. That's why they take so long to cook.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound (2 to 2 1/4 cups) dry white beans such as Navy beans or Great Northern beans (can also use kidney beans)\n1/3 cup molasses\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n3-4 Tbsp Dijon mustard\n1/8 teaspoon ground cloves\n3 cups hot water\n1/2 pound salt pork (can sub bacon), cut into 1/2-inch to 1-inch pieces\n1 medium onion, (1 1/2 cups) chopped\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Soak beans in water: Place beans in a large pot and cover with 2 inches of water. Soak overnight and drain. Alternatively, bring a pot with the beans covered with 2 inches of water to a boil, remove from heat and let soak for a hour, then drain.\n2 Mix molasses, brown sugar, mustard, ground cloves with water: Whisk together the molasses, brown sugar, mustard, and ground cloves with 3 cups of hot water.\n3 Add ingredients to slow-cooker, layering them, starting with the salt pork: Line the bottom of a slow-cooker (or a Dutch oven if you are cooking in the oven) with half of the salt pork (pick the fattiest pieces). Layer over with half of the drained beans. Add all of the chopped onion in a layer.\nTop with another layer of beans and the remaining salt pork. Pour the molasses water mixture over the beans to just cover the beans.\n4 Slow cook until beans are tender: Cover and cook in a slow-cooker on the low setting for 8 hours (or in a 250\xc2\xb0F oven), until the beans are tender. Check the water level a few hours in, and if the beans need more water, add some. Add additional salt to taste if needed.\nNote that fresher beans will cook faster than older beans. Your beans may be ready in less than 8 hours, or they may take longer. Best the next day.\nServe with Boston brown bread.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Bring to a simmer, cover, reduce the heat to a low simmer and cook until the beans are just soft enough to eat, about 1 hour, give or take 15 minutes or so, depending on how old the beans are (older beans will take longer to cook).\n3 Cook bacon or pancetta: Preheat the oven to 325\xc2\xb0F. In a 3 or 4 quart heavy-bottomed, oven-proof, lidded pot such as a Dutch oven, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the bacon or pancetta and cook slowly until lightly browned and crispy.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 onions: Add the chopped onions and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring often, until the onions begin to brown. Use a wooden spoon to scrape any browned bits off the bottom of the pot.\n5 Add garlic, chili flakes, sage, then add tomatoes and stock: Add the garlic, chile flakes and sage and cook for 1-2 minutes, then add the honey and tomato paste. Stir well to combine.\nAdd the tomatoes or tomato sauce and the stock. Bring to a simmer. Taste for salt and add some if needed.\n6 Add the beans, cover, cook in oven: Drain the beans and add them to the pot. Stir well.\nCover the pot and cook in a 325\xc2\xb0F oven for 1 hour and 15 minutes.\nIf still a bit wet, remove the cover and cook for 15 minutes more.\nNote that the cooking time will depend on several things, the most important being how thoroughly the beans were cooked to begin with when they were simmered.\nIf the beans are still a bit hard when they go in the oven, it may take several hours to soften them, once the tomato and honey have been added.\n7 Stir in parsley and balsamic vinegar: Right before serving, gently stir in the chopped parsley and balsamic vinegar. Taste for salt, add more if needed to taste.\nServe either hot or at room temperature.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nPressure Cooker Baked Beans Recipe\nPrep time: 10 minutesCooking (including pressure release) time: 2 hoursYield: 8 to 10 servings\nThis recipe uses an electric pressure cooker. Pressure cooking times will be slightly less if you\'re using a stovetop pressure cooker.\nINGREDIENTS\n1 pound dried Great Northern beans\n1/3 cup molasses\n1/3 cup brown sugar\n3 tablespoons Dijon mustard\n1/8 teaspoon ground cloves\n8 ounces bacon, cut into 1/2-inch pieces\n1 medium onion, diced\nSpecial equipment:\n6-quart electric pressure cooker\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Par-cook the beans: Combine the dried beans and 8 cups of the water in an electric pressure cooker. Secure the lid on the pressure cooker. Make sure that the pressure regulator is set to the \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d position.\nIf you are using an Instant Pot, select the \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, then adjust the time to 15 minutes. If your pressure does not have a \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, set it manually to \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Pressure\xe2\x80\x9d for 15 minutes.\nIt will take about 20 minutes for your pressure cooker to come up to pressure, and then the 15 minutes of actual cooking will begin. \n2 Naturally release the pressure and drain the beans: When the timer goes off, wait for the pressure to release naturally for 15 minutes, then release the rest of the pressure by moving the pressure release knob from \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9cVenting.\xe2\x80\x9d It will take a minute or two for the pressure to release completely.\nAt this point, the beans should be mostly cooked through, but still firm. It\'s fine if there\'s still a little bit of white at the center. If you\'d like to use some of the bean cooking liquid to make your baked beans, scoop out 1 1/2 cups of liquid and set it aside.\nWearing a pair of heat-proof mitts, lift the inner pot out of the pressure cooker and drain the beans into a colander in the sink. Wash out the pot and return it to the pressure cooker.\n3 Prepare the cooking liquid: In a small bowl, whisk together the molasses, sugar, mustard, ground cloves, and 1 1/2 cups water or reserved bean cooking liquid. Set aside.\n4 Saut\xc3\xa9 the bacon and onions: Reset the electric pressure cooker, then select its \xe2\x80\x9cSaut\xc3\xa9\xe2\x80\x9d program. Add the bacon to the pot and saut\xc3\xa9 it until it begins to render some fat, about 5 minutes.\nAdd the onions and saut\xc3\xa9 until they are translucent, about 5 more minutes. When done, hit "Cancel" to stop saut\xc3\xa9ing.\n5 Finish cooking the beans: Gently stir the beans and the cooking liquid into the pot with the bacon and onions. Secure the lid on the pressure cooker, again making sure that the pressure regulator is set to the \xe2\x80\x9cSealing\xe2\x80\x9d position.\nIf you are using an Instant Pot, select the \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, then adjust the time to 15 minutes. If your pressure does not have a \xe2\x80\x9cBean/Chili\xe2\x80\x9d program, set it manually to \xe2\x80\x9cHigh Pressure\xe2\x80\x9d for 15 minutes.\nIt will take about 15 minutes for your pressure cooker to come up to pressure, and then the 15 minutes of actual cooking will begin.\n6 Let the pressure release naturally: When the cooking program finishes, let the pressure cooker completely release its pressure naturally. This will take about 30 minutes.\nDon\xe2\x80\x99t perform a quick release, as the thick cooking liquid will sputter out of the pressure release valve.\n7 Serve the beans warm: They are very good straight out of the pot, and taste even better the next day. Reheat beans over low temperature on the stovetop, in a low oven, or in the microwave.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nKale Salad with Balsamic Dressing Recipe\nPrep time: 25 minutesRest in dressing time: 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8\nSlightly adapted from a Dan Barber recipe that appeared in Bon Appetit in 2009.\nFeel free to sub out the pine nuts with toasted slivered almonds, and the dried sweetened cranberries with golden raisins. We use both interchangeably in this salad.\nIf you are using regular kale instead of dinosaur kale, you might want to let the salad marinate a bit longer, two hours or more, before serving.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/4 cup dried sweetened cranberries, chopped (or whole golden raisins or currants)\n1/3 cup pine nuts (can substitute slivered almonds)\n1 pound fresh Lacinato kale (also called Tuscan kale or dinosaur kale), about 2-3 bunches, rinsed and patted dry\n1/4 cup balsamic vinegar\n3 tablespoons olive oil\n1 tablespoon seasoned rice vinegar\n1 tablespoon honey\n1 teaspoon salt\n1/2 teaspoon pepper\n1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese, packed\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Toast the pine nuts: Heat a small skillet on medium high heat. Spread the pine nuts in an even layer on the bottom of the pan. Cook, stirring occasionally, until lightly browned. Then remove to a bowl to allow to cool.\nHint when toasting nuts: do not take your eyes off of them! Nuts can go from browned to burned very quickly.\n2 Prep the kale: Use a sharp knife to cut out the tough midrib of each kale leaf, and discard or compost. Slice the leaves crosswise into thin, 1/4 inch wide, slices.\nThe easiest way to do this is to work with a small bunch of leaves at a time, stack the leaves and roll them into a loose cigar shape. Then using a sharp knife, work from one end of the "cigar" to the other, slicing a 1/4 inch off from the end.\nPlace the kale slices into a large bowl.\n3 Make the dressing: In a smaller bowl, whisk together the balsamic vinegar, olive oil, rice vinegar, honey, salt, and pepper.\n4 Dress the kale and toss with nuts and cranberries: A half hour to an hour or two before serving, toss the kale together with the toasted pine nuts, the dried cranberries, and the dressing, allowing the kale to marinate a bit.\n5 Right before serving, stir in the grated Parmesan cheese.\nHello!

They are delicate-tasting birds and need this delicate treatment to truly shine. If you are aiming for a temperature, 150\xc2\xb0F in either the leg or breast is ideal; quail are so small the whole bird will likely be the same temperature throughout.\nINGREDIENTS\n4 whole quail\n1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil\nSalt\n1 celery stick\n1/2 cup chicken stock\n1/2 cup inexpensive balsamic vinegar\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Defrost frozen quail: If you are working with frozen quail, either defrost overnight in the refrigerator, or place the package in a large bowl and cover with a couple inches of room temperature water for 20 minutes.\n2 Truss the quail: Pre-heat the oven to 500\xc2\xb0F. Truss the quail with kitchen string. Cut off a length of string about 18 inches long. Cross the middle of the string over the quail's legs and bring the string around to the front of the bird, making sure it holds the wings close to the bird's flanks. Tie the string tightly around the neck.\n(Chowhound has an excellent video on how to truss a chicken, and quail are the same, only smaller.)\nAllow the quail to come to room temperature for at least 20 minutes.\n3 Arrange quail in roasting pan: Pat the quail dry with paper towels. Coat the quail with the olive oil and salt well. When the oven is hot, arrange the quail, breast side up, in a small roasting pan. Use pieces of the celery stick to keep the birds upright while they roast.\n4 Roast quail: Roast quail for 10-12 minutes in a 500\xc2\xb0F oven. Remove the birds from the pan and set aside on a plate to rest for 10 minutes, loosely tented with foil.\n5 Make balsamic reduction: As the quail are resting, make the sauce by putting the roasting pan on a burner set to medium heat.

Keep the stock warm while making the risotto.\n2 Cook shallots and garlic: Melt a tablespoon of butter in a wide saucepan on medium heat. Add the chopped shallots and cook until translucent, a couple of minutes.\nAdd the minced garlic and cook until fragrant, a half minute more.\n3 Lightly brown the rice: Add the risotto rice to the pan and toss to coat with the shallots. Increase the heat to medium high and let the rice start to brown.\n4 Add the white wine: Stir in the white wine. The pan will steam up. Let the rice absorb the wine.\n5 Start adding the stock, 1/2 cup at a time: Here is the real process of making risotto. Add the stock, a half cup or ladleful at a time, slowly stirring the rice, and allowing the rice to absorb the stock for a minute or two, before adding another ladleful of stock.\nYou\'ll want to stop adding the stock when the rice is cooked through, but still a little firm to the bite, "al dente". Note that you may not need all of the stock you have heated for this recipe.\n6 Add balsamic, tomatoes, thyme with last 1/2 cup of stock: When it comes time for that last 1/2 cup of stock to add to the risotto, add it, as well as the balsamic vinegar. Balsamic vinegar can vary in its acidity and intensity. So, add 1 tablespoon to start, and add another tablespoon if you want more of the balsamic flavor.\nAdd half of the cherry tomatoes and add the thyme. Let the tomatoes soften with the cooking of the risotto in those last few minutes.\n7 Remove from heat, stir in Parm: When the risotto has reached it\'s "al dente" stage, remove it from heat. Stir in the shredded Parmesan cheese. Sprinkle with pepper.\n8 Serve: Serve with remaining halved fresh cherry tomatoes and thinly sliced basil on top.\n  Hello!

Pour the marinade over the steaks, turning them to coat the steaks on all sides. Close the bag or container, pushing as much air out as possible. Refrigerate and marinate the steaks for at least 2 hours, or up to 24 hours.\n3 Heat your broiler: Preheat your oven broiler to 550\xc2\xbaF (or as high as your broiler goes) with the oven rack in its highest position (about 4 to 6 inches from the broiler element), and line a baking sheet with aluminum foil.\n4 Dry the steaks: Pat the steaks dry with paper towels and place them on the lined baking sheet. Patting the steaks dry is very important\xe2\x80\x94you don\xe2\x80\x99t want a bunch of extra marinade on the steaks and the sheet pan, as it will just burn under the broiler.\n5 Broil the steaks: Broil the steaks for 4 minutes on the first side, then use a pair of tongs to flip them and broil for 4 minutes more on the second side. Use a digital thermometer to test for doneness.\nI aim for around 130\xc2\xbaF in the center for medium-rare to medium steaks\xe2\x80\x94they\xe2\x80\x99ll continue to cook a bit after you take them out of the oven. If the steaks are not yet done, flip and broil for an additional minute, and test again. (I usually end up broiling my steaks for 4 to 6 minutes per side, depending on their thickness.)\nIf the steaks are already charred after 4 minutes per side, but still undercooked in the middle, lower the oven rack a rung for the remainder of cooking, or even just turn the oven off and use the carryover heat to finish cooking the steaks for another minute or two.\n6 Rest and Serve: Transfer the steaks to a cutting board.

Add the garlic and rosemary and saut\xc3\xa9 1 minute more, until the garlic is no longer raw. Add the beef broth and balsamic vinegar, then use a wooden spoon to nudge any browned bits from the bottom of the pot.\n4 Pressure cook the roast: Use the tongs to lower the pot roast back into the pot, and spoon some of the cooking liquid over the top of the roast.\nSecure the lid on your pressure cooker in its Sealing position. Cancel the Saut\xc3\xa9 program, then select the Manual or Pressure Cook program for 55 minutes at high pressure. (It will take about 5 minutes for the pot to come up to pressure before the cooking program begins.)\n5 Release the pressure: When the cooking program ends, let the pressure release naturally for at least 15 minutes, then move the pressure release valve from to Venting to release any remaining steam. \nYou can also leave the pot roast on the Keep Warm setting for up to 10 hours. You do not need to vent the steam.\n6 Rest the pot roast: Open the pot and use the tongs to transfer the roast to a cutting board. Cover the roast with aluminum foil to keep it warm.\n7 Strain the cooking liquid: Set a strainer over a fat separator in the sink. Wearing heat-resistant mitts, lift the inner pot out of the pressure cooker housing and pour the cooking liquid through the strainer and into the fat separator. (If you don't have a fat separator, you can pour the liquid into a ziplock bag, tilt it, let the fat rise to the top. Then, cut a hole in the bottom corner of the bag to let the liquid strain out, stopping before you get to the fat.)\nDiscard the rosemary stems, then add the strained onions, garlic, and rosemary leaves back to pot. Pour the liquid from fat separator back into the pot as well. Discard the fat.\n8 Pressure cook the vegetables: Add the potatoes and carrots to the pot and place it back in its housing. Secure the lid in its Sealing position.\nCancel the cooking program, then select the Manual or Pressure Cook program for 5 minutes at high pressure. (It will take about 15 minutes for the pot to come up to pressure before the cooking program begins.)\n9 Release the pressure: When the cooking program ends, perform a quick pressure release by moving the pressure release valve to Venting to release the steam.\n10 Serve: Open the pot, then use a slotted spoon to transfer vegetables to serving dish. Taste the cooking liquid for seasoning, adding salt and/or pepper if needed.\nRemove any string from the pot roast, then carve it into 1/2-inch thick slices. Arrange the pot roast on the serving plate with the vegetables. Ladle some of the cooking liquid over the meat and vegetables, garnish with parsley (if using), and serve.\nHello!

b"Save It Print\nChocolate Banana Bread Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Makes one 9x5-inch loaf\nUse very ripe or over-ripe bananas. The peels should be at least half browned, and the bananas inside squishy and browning.\nDo not use Dutch processed cocoa for this recipe, only natural unsweetened.\nMelted coconut oil can be used in place of the butter. The flavor will change a little and you may get a hint of coconut in the result.\nThere is only 1 egg and 1 teaspoon of baking soda in this recipe for leavening, so make sure your baking soda is still good! (See more info on baking soda and baking powder.)\nINGREDIENTS\n3 large ripe bananas (easily mashable)\n1/3 cup melted butter\n3/4 cup brown sugar (packed, light or dark)\n1 teaspoon salt (1/2 a teaspoon if using salted butter)\n1 large egg, beaten\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 1/4 cup all purpose flour\n1/4 cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\n1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips\nSpecial equipment:\n1 5x9-inch loaf pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare pan and preheat oven:  Butter or spray with cooking spray the inside of a 5x9-inch loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) with a rack in the middle.\n2 Pur\xc3\xa9e bananas: Using a blender, food processor, or a fork, pur\xc3\xa9e the peeled ripe bananas until smooth. You should have 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups of banana pur\xc3\xa9e.\n3 Mix wet ingredients and sugar: Place the banana pur\xc3\xa9e into a large mixing bowl. Stir the melted butter. Stir in the brown sugar and salt. Whisk to break up any clumps of brown sugar. Stir in the beaten egg and vanilla extract.\n4 Mix dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and allspice.\n5 Add the flour mixture to the banana mixture and stir until just incorporated.\nStir in the chocolate chips.\n6 Bake: Pour batter into a buttered loaf pan. Place in a 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) oven and bake for 1 hour.\nNote that because of the chocolate chips that melt in the bread as it cooks, it's hard to check for doneness using a tester that you insert.\nOne way to test is to gently push the center top of the chocolate banana bread down with your finger. If it feels relatively firm and bounces back when you release your finger, that's a good sign that it's done.\n7 Let cool: Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes in the pan.\nGently remove the loaf from the pan and place on a rack to cool completely.\nSlice with a serrated bread knife to serve.\nHello!

If so, apply sparingly so there is enough to cover the entire cake.\nFeel free to use any favorite liquor, such as Grand Marnier, Triple Sec, Cognac, Armagnac, Brandy or even Bourbon. Or, simply omit the liquor and use 2 tsp vanilla extract.\n  INGREDIENTS\nFor the cake:\n3 cups all-purpose flour\n2 teaspoons baking powder (make sure your baking powder is still fresh!)\n1/2 teaspoon baking soda\n1 teaspoon salt\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg (optional)\n3 large eggs\n2 cups granulated white sugar\n1 cup canola oil\n2 teaspoons vanilla extract\n1 (8 ounce) can crushed pineapple, with juice\n2 cups mashed bananas (from 3 to 5 bananas)\n1 cup finely chopped pecans\nFor the cream cheese frosting:\n1 pound cream cheese, softened\n1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened\n2 pounds (32-ounces) powdered sugar\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon Cointreau or other liquor (see Recipe Note)\n1 cup roughly chopped pecans, for topping (optional, toasted)\nEdible flowers for garnish (optional)\nSpecial equipment:\n3 9-inch cake pans\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 350\xc2\xb0 F. Butter and flour three 9-inch round cake pans.\n2 Whisk together dry ingredients: In a large bowl, vigorously whisk together the dry ingredients: flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, cinnamon, and nutmeg (optional).\n3 Whisk together oil, sugar, eggs, then stir in pineapple, bananas, vanilla, 1 cup of pecans: In a separate bowl, whisk the canola oil, sugar, and eggs together until combined. Stir the pineapple, bananas, vanilla and one cup of the chopped pecans into the egg mixture and mix (do not beat).\n4 Fold wet ingredients into dry: Using a wooden spoon or spatula, fold the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients until just combined (do not over-mix).\n5 Pour into cake pans and bake: Pour the batter into the three prepared cake pans, taking care to divide evenly. Bake at 350\xc2\xb0F on center racks of oven for 20 to 25 minutes, or until a toothpick or knife inserted in the center comes out clean.\n6 Cool: Allow the cakes to cool in the pan on wire racks for 10 minutes.  After 10 minutes, run a knife around the edges and remove the cakes from the pans.  Cool completely on wire racks before frosting.\n7 Make the frosting: Beat the softened butter and cream cheese in a large bowl with an electric mixer. With the mixer on low speed, add the powdered sugar in small amounts until all is incorporated, then add the Cointreau and vanilla and beat until the frosting is light and fluffy.\nNote: Do not add the powdered sugar while the mixer is set on a high speed, or you will create a snowy mess of sugar all over your kitchen. (Please do not ask me how I know this.)\n8 Frost the cake: Place one layer, top down, on a large plate or cake stand (this creates a smooth surface on the top and results in a more level cake). Spread frosting evenly over the first layer, then repeat with the second and third layers, then frost the sides.\n3 Sprinkle with chopped pecans: Sprinkle the top completely with the remaining cup of chopped pecans (toasted or un-toasted). Alternatively, press the chopped pecans onto the sides of the cake and leave the top simply frosted.\nThis cake is best served the day it's made and can be kept, assembled and frosted, for a few hours before servings. If you need to serve it the next day or if you have leftovers, cover the cake as well as possible and refrigerate it. Remove it from the fridge and let it come up to room temperature for an hour or two before serving.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

b'Save It Print\nCrunchy Banana Nut Granola Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: About 4 cups of granola\nI call for raw walnuts because they toast in the oven along with the granola, and nuts that have already been toasted can burn. If you can\xe2\x80\x99t find raw walnuts, you can sub raw almonds or pecans, or simply add toasted walnuts in the last 10 minutes of cooking.\nIf you like your granola in big clusters, spread the granola in a single, even layer on the baking sheets and do not stir during baking. This way, the granola will bake into one solid piece and you can break it up to clusters once cool.\nYou can store this granola in airtight containers for about a week, though it rarely lasts so long in our house.\nINGREDIENTS\n1/4 cup unsalted butter (If using salted butter, taste your mixture before adding salt)\n1/3 cup lightly packed light brown sugar\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon water\n3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (Certified gluten-free, if needed)\n3/4 cup chopped raw walnuts (See recipe notes)\n1/4 cup chia seeds\n1 tablespoon cinnamon\n1/2 teaspoon salt\n2 medium ripe bananas, diced\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Preheat the oven to 275F with two racks placed in the upper and lower halves. Line two baking sheets with parchment paper.\n2 Brown the butter: Slice the butter into small pats. In a small saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, the butter will start foam a bit, then it will begin to turn amber-colored and smell fragrant and nutty.\nWatch closely, as the butter can go from browned to blackened fairly quickly. This whole process should only take about 3 minutes.\nRemove the pan from heat immediately, and pour the melted butter into a small heatproof bowl.\n3 Melt the brown sugar: In the same saucepan used to brown the butter, add the brown sugar, vanilla, and water.\nStir over medium-low heat until combined, then cook until the brown sugar is thoroughly melted, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat.\n4 Mix the granola: In a large bowl, mix the oats, walnuts, chia seeds, cinnamon, and salt until they are combined and the ingredients look well-distributed.\nAdd the melted brown butter and brown sugar mix and stir to combine. Then add the diced bananas and stir very gently.\n5 Bake the granola: Divide the granola between two baking sheets and spread into an even layer. Place into the warm oven and bake the granola for 45 minutes.\nHalf way through baking, stir the granola, then swap the top and bottom baking sheets and rotate the pans to avoid any hotspots. (If you want big clusters of granola, do not stir the granola.)\n6 Cool the granola: Remove the granola from oven and allow to cool for 20 to 30 minutes before stirring and serving. Store in airtight containers for up to a week.\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected. Please do not use our photos without prior written permission. Thank you!\nSave It Print'

Pour the grape juice mixture over the berries, and press down on the berries to submerge them into the juice/gelatin mixture.\n4 Chill: Cover with plastic wrap. Chill in the refrigerator until firm, 3 hours.\n5 Un-mold: To un-mold, fill a basin half-way with hot water. Carefully lower the bottom of the loaf pan into the hot water and hold for 5 to 8 seconds. This will melt the gelatin at the edge of the pan, helping it to release.\nRun a dull knife around the edge of the pan as well.\nPlace a serving platter topside down on top of the loaf pan and turn the whole thing over.

Break the graham crackers into a few pieces and place in the bowl of a food processor. Process the crackers until there are no large chunks left. The mixture should be sandy but not powdery.\nPour the crumbs into a bowl and stir in the melted butter, sugar, and salt. The mixture should be like wet sand and clump together when pinched.\nPress the crumbs firmly into the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate to form a crust, using a measuring cup or glass to help you press firmly.\n3 Bake the graham cracker crust: Bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until the crust has started to turn a slightly darker brown color and smells fragrant. Remove from the oven and set aside to cool completely.\n4 Make the cream pie filling: Combine the sugar, egg yolks, and cornstarch in a medium saucepan. Whisk off the heat until they gain a little volume and turn a light yellow. Whisk in the milks and salt.\nPlace the pan over medium heat and whisk constantly until thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. (If this seems to be going really slowly, it's ok to nudge the heat up a little.)\nWhen the filling ready, the whisk should momentarily leave some visible trails on the surface before disappearing. Stir in the vanilla and shredded coconut.\n5 Transfer to pie crust: Spread half of the cream filling mixture into the cooled graham cracker crust. Slice the bananas and layer them on top, then cover with the remaining custard. Make sure to cover all the bananas (so they don\xe2\x80\x99t brown!).\nSmooth the surface and press plastic wrap directly on top.\n6 Refrigerate the pie at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours to set.\n7 Make the whipped cream topping: When ready to serve the pie, use a stand mixer or hand mixer to whip the cream until it holds soft peaks. Whisk in the sugar, and continue beating until the cream holds a medium peak. Generously dollop the cream over the top of the chilled pie. Sprinkle the top with extra shredded coconut.\nOnce assembled, the pie can be kept refrigerated for a few hours before serving. (Longer than a few hours, however, and the whipped cream can start to weep. It still tastes good, but is less visually appealing!)\nHello! All photos and content are copyright protected.

Published by Ten Speed Press, an imprint of Penguin Random House LLC. (Photography copyright 2016 by Anson Smart.)\nINGREDIENTS\nFor the French toast:\n1 cup (240ml) unsweetened almond or macadamia milk (strained if homemade)\n1 ripe medium banana\n2 tablespoons pure maple syrup, plus more to serve\n1 teaspoon natural vanilla extract\n1 tablespoon white (or black) chia seeds\n1 teaspoon ground cinnamon\n1\xe2\x81\x844 teaspoon natural salt\n8 slices gluten-free sandwich bread\n1\xe2\x81\x844 cup (60ml) coconut oil (in liquid form), plus more as needed\nFor the caramelized bananas:\n2 medium bananas, thickly sliced on the diagonal\n1\xe2\x81\x844 cup (37g) coconut sugar\n1 to 2 tablespoons coconut oil (in liquid form)\nPure maple syrup, to serve\nOptional boosters:\n1\xe2\x81\x844 cup (60ml) bourbon or rum\n2 tablespoons crushed raw pecans or walnuts\n1 tablespoon unsweetened dried shredded coconut\nSpecial equipment:\nBlender\nMETHOD\n1 Set the oven to its lowest temperature or the \xe2\x80\x9cwarm\xe2\x80\x9d setting.\n2 Make the French toast batter: Combine the milk, banana, maple syrup, vanilla, chia seeds, cinnamon, and salt into your blender and blast on high for about 30 seconds, until well combined. Pour the mixture into a large shallow baking dish and let rest for about 5 minutes to thicken slightly.\n3 Soak the bread in the batter: In batches, place slices of the bread in the baking dish and let soak on one side for 8 to 10 seconds. Flip the slices and let soak for another 8 to 10 seconds, until evenly moistened.\n4 Cook the French toast: In a medium skillet (that fits two slices of bread) or on a large griddle (that holds all of the slices) over medium heat, warm 1 to 2 tablespoons of coconut oil per two slices of bread. (Resist the urge to use less coconut oil, or the bread won\xe2\x80\x99t get crispy.)\nAdd the bread and fry for 4 to 6 minutes on each side, until golden brown and crispy on the edges; you may need to add more coconut oil after you flip the bread. If cooking in batches, transfer the French toast to a lined baking sheet and place in the oven to keep warm, and repeat to fry the remaining bread, adding more coconut oil to cook each batch.\n5 While the last pieces of toast are cooking, make the caramelized bananas. Combine the banana slices and the coconut sugar in a zipper-lock bag, seal, and shake to coat evenly. In a skillet over medium-high heat, warm the coconut oil, add the coated bananas and the bourbon booster (if using), and fry for about 2 minutes on each side until nicely caramelized.\n6 To serve: Serve two slices of French toast on each plate, topped with one-quarter of the caramelized bananas, one-quarter of the crushed nut boosters, and one-quarter of the coconut booster.

b"Save It Print\nChocolate Banana Bread Recipe\nPrep time: 15 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Makes one 9x5-inch loaf\nUse very ripe or over-ripe bananas. The peels should be at least half browned, and the bananas inside squishy and browning.\nDo not use Dutch processed cocoa for this recipe, only natural unsweetened.\nMelted coconut oil can be used in place of the butter. The flavor will change a little and you may get a hint of coconut in the result.\nThere is only 1 egg and 1 teaspoon of baking soda in this recipe for leavening, so make sure your baking soda is still good! (See more info on baking soda and baking powder.)\nINGREDIENTS\n3 large ripe bananas (easily mashable)\n1/3 cup melted butter\n3/4 cup brown sugar (packed, light or dark)\n1 teaspoon salt (1/2 a teaspoon if using salted butter)\n1 large egg, beaten\n1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n1 1/4 cup all purpose flour\n1/4 cup natural unsweetened cocoa powder\n1 teaspoon baking soda\n1/4 teaspoon ground allspice\n1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips\nSpecial equipment:\n1 5x9-inch loaf pan\nMETHODHIDE PHOTOS\n1 Prepare pan and preheat oven:  Butter or spray with cooking spray the inside of a 5x9-inch loaf pan. Preheat oven to 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) with a rack in the middle.\n2 Pur\xc3\xa9e bananas: Using a blender, food processor, or a fork, pur\xc3\xa9e the peeled ripe bananas until smooth. You should have 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 cups of banana pur\xc3\xa9e.\n3 Mix wet ingredients and sugar: Place the banana pur\xc3\xa9e into a large mixing bowl. Stir the melted butter. Stir in the brown sugar and salt. Whisk to break up any clumps of brown sugar. Stir in the beaten egg and vanilla extract.\n4 Mix dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, vigorously whisk together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and allspice.\n5 Add the flour mixture to the banana mixture and stir until just incorporated.\nStir in the chocolate chips.\n6 Bake: Pour batter into a buttered loaf pan. Place in a 350\xc2\xb0F (175\xc2\xb0C) oven and bake for 1 hour.\nNote that because of the chocolate chips that melt in the bread as it cooks, it's hard to check for doneness using a tester that you insert.\nOne way to test is to gently push the center top of the chocolate banana bread down with your finger. If it feels relatively firm and bounces back when you release your finger, that's a good sign that it's done.\n7 Let cool: Remove from oven and let cool for 10 minutes in the pan.\nGently remove the loaf from the pan and place on a rack to cool completely.\nSlice with a serrated bread knife to serve.\nHello!
