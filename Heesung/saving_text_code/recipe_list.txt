Sweet Corn Gnocchi Skillet Recipe
Prep time: 15 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: 4 servings
INGREDIENTS
1 pound gnocchi
2 tablespoons olive oil
Kernels from 3 ears sweet corn, or about 3 cups corn kernels
1 small sweet onion, diced
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup heavy cream (optional)
1/2 teaspoon salt
Ground black pepper
8 ounces small mozzarella balls (also called pearls or ciliegine)
Fresh basil, minced
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Cook the gnocchi: Bring a pot of salted water to boil. Add gnocchi and cook until they float, about 4-5 minutes. Remove gnocchi and reserve 1/2 cup of the cooking water for the skillet.
2 Cook the corn kernels: Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, then add the olive oil. When the oil is shimmering, add the corn kernels. Let kernels cook in the skillet for 4-5 minutes until they are brown and blistered. Don’t stir them too much. Let them sit so they get some color.
3 Add onions and garlic: Once the corn has blistered, add the sweet onions and garlic. Cook for a few minutes until the onions have softened and are translucent.
4 Make the skillet sauce: Once the onions are soft, add the cooked gnocchi to the skillet and toss everything together. Turn the heat down to low and add 1/2 cup of the reserved gnocchi water, or 1/2 cup cream. Stir to combine ingredients, then let simmer until the sauce has thickened slightly. Taste and season with salt and pepper.
5 Finish the dish: Right before serving, add the mozzarella balls to the skillet and garnish with fresh basil.
Leftovers will keep well in the fridge for a few days. Reheat it in a skillet over low heat with a little water. If you freeze the dish, make sure to thaw and reheat it gently. A microwave will ruin the sauce and the gnocchi texture.

Skillet Peach Crisp with Ginger and Pecans Recipe
Prep time: 10 minutesCook time: 35 minutesYield: 8 to 10 servings
You can make your own oat flour by pulverizing rolled oats in a food processor, but most supermarkets carry oat flour as well. One of my favorite brands is Bob’s Red Mill.
Recipe Tester Suggestion: Add an extra peach or two if you have them and want more juicy peaches in your crisp!
INGREDIENTS
For the crisp topping:
1/2 cup (66 grams) oat flour (See recipe note)
1/2 cup (78 grams) all-purpose flour
1/3 cup old-fashioned rolled oats
1/4 cup light brown sugar
1/2 teaspoon fine sea salt or table salt
3/4 cups pecans, roughly chopped
1/2 cup unsalted butter cut into small pieces, well chilled
For the peaches:
2 pounds peaches, sliced 1/2-inch thick (about 6 medium, or 6 cups sliced)
1/2 teaspoon ground ginger
1/3 cup crystallized candied ginger, diced small
1/4 cup granulated sugar
2 tablespoons lemon juice (about 1/2 lemon)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, for the pan
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Preheat oven to 350°F.
2 Make the crisp topping: In a small bowl, combine the two flours with a fork—sometimes oat flour clumps together more than all-purpose. Add the rolled oats, brown sugar, and sea salt. Add the pecans and stir to combine.
Finally, rub the butter until topping is buttery and crumbly. It should clump together easily between your fingers.
3 Prepare the peaches: In a medium bowl, combine the sliced peaches, ground ginger, crystalized ginger, and sugar, along with the lemon juice. Stir together gently with a spatula.
4 Prepare the pan: Put the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter into the cast iron pan and place into the oven for about 5 minutes, just until the butter melts.
5 Assemble the crisp: Remove the pan from the oven and add the peach-ginger combination, spreading it out evenly. Add little dabs of the crisp topping as evenly as you can across the top of the peaches.
  6 Bake the crisp: Bake in the oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the filling is bubbling and the top is golden brown.
7 Cool and serve: This is going to be hard, but you need to wait at least an hour before you scoop into this. Otherwise the juices will run everywhere, and you may burn your mouth.
Once it’s made, this keeps best covered, in the refrigerator, for 3 to 4 days. Simply reheat it in a low oven for about 10 minutes.

Tuscan Chicken Pasta Skillet Recipe
Prep time: 25 minutesCook time: 25 minutesMarinating time: 15 minutesYield: 4 servings
INGREDIENTS
For the marinade:
1/4 cup olive oil
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon dried Italian seasoning
For the dinner:
1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken breasts
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
12 ounces cherry tomatoes (about 2 cups), halved
1 tablespoon minced garlic
8 ounces spaghetti
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
1 cup quartered marinated artichokes hearts, drained
1/3 cup Kalamata olives, pitted and sliced
1/4 cup freshly grated parmesan cheese
6 basil leaves, thinly sliced
2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley (optional)
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Marinate the chicken: In a small bowl, combine 1/4 cup olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, 1/2 teaspoon pepper, and Italian seasoning. Cut each chicken breast lengthwise to create 4 long, thin pieces. Place chicken in a shallow dish. Pour marinade over the chicken, turn to evenly coat. Let sit for 15 minutes before cooking.
2 Cook the chicken: Heat a large high-sided skillet or sauté pan over medium-high heat. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil. Once the oil is hot, add the chicken. Cook until the chicken is golden brown and fully cooked, about 6 to 8 minutes per side.
Transfer chicken to a cutting board to rest while cooking the pasta.
3 Cook the pasta: Add tomatoes, garlic, spaghetti, 4 cups water, and 1/2 teaspoon salt to the skillet. Bring to a boil over high heat. Cook and stir frequently, until the pasta is tender and water has mostly evaporated—about 9 to 11 minutes. You want to have a small amount of water in the pan to create a light sauce.
Add more water if needed, 1/2 cup at a time for a softer pasta. Turn off the heat.  
4 Finish and toss: Cut the chicken into 1/4-inch thick slices. Add the artichoke hearts, olives, Parmesan cheese, sliced chicken, and basil. Toss to combine. If you'd like a thicker sauce, you can add 1 or 2 tablespoons of butter. Taste and season with more salt and pepper as desired.
5 Serve: Garnish pasta with parsley, then divide among plates and serve warm.

Steak on the Stovetop Recipe
Prep time: 30 minutesCook time: 10 minutesYield: 2 servings
INGREDIENTS
One 3/4- to 1-pound steak, 3/4- to 1-inch thick, such as ribeye, strip, or porterhouse
Kosher salt
2 tablespoons unsalted butter, optional
A few sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary, optional
Flaky sea salt, for sprinkling, optional
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Pat the steak dry: Pat the steak dry with paper towels and season it liberally with salt all over; let rest at room temperature for 30 minutes.
2 Heat the skillet: Heat a cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet large enough to hold the steak on the stove over medium-high heat until very hot and it just barely starts to smoke, about 3 minutes.
3 Pat the steak dry (again) and cook: Pat the steak dry again with paper towels, add the steak, and cook, pressing down to make sure it gets good contact with the pan, until a nice sear starts to form, about 2 minutes; flip over and cook for 2 minutes more.
For a rare to medium-rare steak: Depending on the thickness of your steak, for a rare to medium-rare steak you should be able to remove the steak from the pan after 4 total minutes of cooking time.
For a medium to well-done steak: Reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook, flipping over every minute or so, to your desired temperature, anywhere from an additional 2 to 6 minutes (or more for extra well-done).
4 Baste with butter and herbs (optional): If you want even more flavor, add the butter and herbs to the pan during the last couple minutes of cooking and baste it with the butter.
5 Serve: Remove the steak from the pan and let rest for a couple of minutes before slicing. If desired, sprinkle with some flaky sea salt. Serve.

Slow Cooker Chickpea Curry with Sweet Potatoes and Red Peppers Recipe
Prep time: 15 minutesCook time: 8 hoursYield: 8 to 10 servings
I prefer white-fleshed sweet potatoes for this recipe because they're starchier and hold up better to longer cooking. If you use orange-fleshed sweet potatoes, they will break down a little more and make a thicker, creamier sauce, which is also good!
To reduce cooking time, soak the chickpeas overnight, skip the extra water, and cook on high for 4 to 6 hours.
INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon olive oil
1 medium yellow onion, diced
1 pound dried chickpeas, rinsed
2 tablespoons curry powder
1 large white-fleshed sweet potato, peeled and diced (See Recipe Note)
1 large or two small sweet bell peppers, diced (red or yellow, about 1/2 pound)
1 (28-ounce) can diced tomatoes
1 (15.5 ounce) can coconut milk
1 1/4 cups water
3 cloves garlic, minced
1 diced serrano, jalapeño, or fresno chili (optional)
1 teaspoon salt
6 cups spinach, roughly chopped, to serve
Cooked rice, to serve (optional)
Chopped cilantro, to serve
Lime or lemon wedges, to serve
Special equipment:
6-quart or larger slow cooker
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Combine the ingredients in the slow cooker: Drizzle olive oil in the bottom of a 6-quart or larger slow cooker then add onion and stir to coat. Pour dried chickpeas on top, then sprinkle the curry powder evenly over the beans.
Follow with sweet potato, bell pepper, tomatoes, coconut milk, water, garlic, chili pepper (if using), and salt. Do not stir (leaving the chickpeas on the bottom and the sweet potatoes on top helps everything cook more evenly).
2 Cook on low for 6 to 8 hours: If you're around, stir the curry after about 4 hours and give it a check. At this point, the curry should seem soupy and the chickpeas will likely be edible, but still crunchy. If the slow cooker seems dry, add another half cup of water. (The curry will also be fine if you're not around to stir it.)
Total cooking time will depend on your slow cooker and your chickpeas. The curry can be served any time after the chickpeas are soft and tender.
It's also fine to if the curry cooks a little longer, or if you leave it on the "warm" setting for a while. The recipe is very forgiving! The curry will get thicker and creamier the longer it cooks.
3 Serve with spinach: Stir the curry well. Taste and add additional salt if needed. Serve the curry over bowls of chopped spinach, stirring to wilt the spinach. (You can also stir the spinach directly into the curry if that's more convenient for you.)
Garnish with cilantro and a squeeze of lemon or lime.
Leftovers will keep for about a week or can be frozen for up to three months.

Potato Leek Soup Recipe
Prep time: 20 minutesCook time: 40 minutesYield: Serves 4-6
Save prep time by peeling and dicing the potatoes while the leeks are cooking in the second step.
You can use either Yukon gold or Russet potatoes for this soup. The Yukon golds will result in a creamier soup.
INGREDIENTS
3 large leeks (about 3 cups, chopped)
2 tablespoons butter
4 cups chicken broth (or vegetable broth for vegetarian option)
2 pounds potatoes (Yukon gold or Russet), peeled, diced into 1/2-inch pieces
1 teaspoon sea salt, less or more to taste
Pinch of dried marjoram
1 or 2 sprigs fresh thyme, or 1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
1 bay leaf
1/4 cup chopped fresh parsley
Sprinkle of Tabasco sauce or other red chili sauce
White or black pepper to taste
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Clean and cut the leeks: Cut off the roots of the leeks. Cut the leeks lengthwise, fan them open under running water to dislodge any dirt or mud hiding inside. Cut off the tough dark green tops and discard (either compost or freeze for making stock).
Slice the white and light green parts of the leeks crosswise into 1/4-inch thick slices. Place the slices in a bowl of cold water and agitate them with your hands to dislodge any remaining dirt. Then scoop out the leeks with a sieve or slotted spoon. (See How to Clean Leeks)
2 Cook leeks in butter to soften: Melt butter on medium heat in a 3 to 4 quart thick-bottomed pot. Add the chopped leeks, stir to coat with the butter.
Cover the pot and reduce the heat to low, cook for 10 minutes until the leeks are softened. Check to make sure the leeks are not browning.
3 Simmer the soup: Add the broth, diced potatoes, bay leaf, marjoram, thyme, and a teaspoon of salt to the pot.
Increase the heat to high to bring to a simmer, then lower the heat to maintain a low simmer, and cook for 20 minutes, until the potatoes are cooked through.
4 Purée the soup: Remove and discard the bay leaf and thyme sprig. Use an immersion blender or standing blender to blend about half of the soup if you want a chunky soup, or all of it if you would like your soup to be more smooth.
Note: if you're using a standing blender, purée the soup in batches, don't fill the blender more than a third full at a time, and remember to hold down the lid while the blender is going.
5 Season the soup: Add the parsley, and cook a few minutes more. Add a few dashes of Tabasco to taste.
Add freshly ground pepper and more salt to taste. (Potatoes soak up salt, so you may need to add more salt than you expect.)

Shrimp Fried Rice Recipe
Prep time: 15 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 4
Make sure to use leftover, day old rice when making fried rice. Freshly made rice will make a fried rice that's mushy.
INGREDIENTS
8 ounces small raw shrimp, shelled and deveined
1/2 teaspoon kosher salt
freshly ground black pepper
1/2 teaspoon cornstarch
3 tablespoons peanut oil, canola oil, or rice bran oil
3 eggs, beaten
2 stalks green onion, minced
4 cups leftover rice, grains separated well
3/4 cup frozen peas and carrots, defrosted
1 tablespoon soy sauce (use gluten-free soy sauce if you are making a gluten-free version), plus more to taste
1 teaspoon dark toasted sesame oil
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Toss shrimp with salt, pepper, cornstarch: In a medium bowl, sprinkle the shrimp with salt, pepper, and cornstarch, and toss to coat. Set aside to sit for ten minutes at room temperature.
2 Heat pan on high heat: Heat a large sauté pan or wok (a seasoned cast iron pan or hard anodized aluminum works well, they're relatively stick free and can take the heat) on high heat.
When the pan is very hot (a drop of water instantly sizzles when it hits the pan), swirl in one tablespoon of the cooking oil to coat the pan.
3 Sear shrimp on both sides: Add the shrimp to the hot pan, spreading them out quickly in a single layer. Let them fry in the pan without moving them, for 30 seconds.
Flip the shrimp over and let them fry on the other side for another 30 seconds or until they are mostly cooked through. (Do not cook them all the way!)
Use a slotted spoon to scoop the shrimp out of the pan to a bowl.
4 Cook beaten eggs, slightly runny: Return the pan to the burner and lower the heat to medium. Add a little more oil if the pan needs it. Add the beaten eggs and stir them quickly to scramble them while they cook.
When the eggs are not quite cooked through, still a bit runny, transfer them from the pan to the bowl with the cooked shrimp.
5 Sauté green onions, add rice: Clean out the pan or wok with paper towels and return it to the burner. Heat the pan on high and when it is hot, swirl in the remaining tablespoon or two of oil. When the oil is shimmering hot (almost smoking), add the green onions and sauté for 15 seconds.
Then add the leftover cooked rice to the pan and stir with the green onions to mix well.
Spread the rice onion mixture over the surface of the pan and let it fry, without moving it. You should hear the rice sizzle. Cook for about 1 to 2 minutes.
Use a spatula to turn over the rice, and spread it over the pan again. Let cook for a minute longer.
6 Add soy sauce, carrots, peas, shrimp, eggs, sesame oil: Sprinkle soy sauce on the rice and stir to combine.
Add the carrots, peas, shrimp, eggs, and sesame oil, stirring to combine well.
Heat everything until sizzling hot. Add more soy sauce to taste.

Quick and Easy Pan-Fried Flank Steak Recipe
Prep time: 10 minutesCook time: 15 minutesSteak resting time: 10 minutesYield: Serves 4 to 6
INGREDIENTS
1 1/2 pound flank steak
Salt
Freshly ground black pepper
Dry mustard
Softened butter
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Tenderize the steak with shallow cuts: Remove the steak from the refrigerator a half hour before cooking.
Cut away any tough connective tissue on the surface of the steak.
Using the tip of a sharp knife, poke small cuts into the meat, almost all the way through. The cuts should be at an angle, in the direction of the grain of the meat as the knife tip is going in. The cuts should be about an inch apart from each other.
Turn the steak over and repeat the cuts on the other side. Make sure that the cuts you are making on this side are parallel with the cuts you made on the other side, otherwise you may cut across an existing cut, and end up poking a hole through the meat.
2 Rub with salt, pepper, dry mustard, and butter: Sprinkle one side of the steak with salt and freshly ground pepper. Sprinkle the steak with dry mustard. (You can use regular mustard if you don't have any dry mustard.)
Rub a tablespoon of butter all over the side of the steak. Turn the steak over and repeat with the dry mustard, pepper, and butter.
3 Sear steak in hot frying pan: Heat a large cast iron frying pan on high heat. Place steak in hot pan. Let sear for 2 to 3 minutes until well browned.
Use tongs to lift up to see if nicely browned. If so, flip to the other side and let sear for 2 to 3 minutes.
4 Remove from heat: Remove the pan from the heat and let the steak continue to cook for 5 to 10 minutes in the residual heat of the pan (assuming you are using cast iron, if not, lower the heat to low).
5 Check for doneness: Use your fingertips to check for doneness or insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the steak - 120°F for very rare, 125°F for rare, or 130°F for medium rare. Flank steak should be served rare or medium rare, otherwise it may be too dry.
If the steak isn't done enough to your liking, return the steak and pan to medium high heat for a few minutes.
6 Let the steak rest: Remove the steak from the pan to a cutting board and let rest for 10 minutes, covered with aluminum foil.
7 Thinly slice: Cut the meat in very thin slices, at an angle, across the grain of the meat. (This way you break through the tough long muscle fibers.)
8 Boil juices, deglaze pan, add butter to make sauce: Any juices that come out of the meat while cutting or resting, return to the pan. Return the pan to a burner on high heat and deglaze the pan with a little water, scraping up any browned bits. Once the water has mostly boiled down, add a little butter to the pan for a nice sauce.
Arrange the cut meat on a serving plate and pour the deglazed pan juices over the meat.

New England Boiled Dinner Recipe
Cook time: 4 hours, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6 to 8
Corned beef can be pretty salty, so if you are making boiled dinner with corned beef you may want to put it in a pot, cover with cold water, bring to a boil, and then discard the water before starting the recipe. If the broth ends up being too salty, you can serve just the meat and vegetables, without the broth, or add water to the broth to dilute it.
INGREDIENTS
3 1/2 pounds corned beef brisket or plain beef brisket
15 peppercorns
8 whole cloves
1 bay leaf
Salt, if using plain brisket
2 medium sized turnips, peeled and quartered
4 red new potatoes, peeled and quartered
3 large carrots, cut into thirds and the thickest pieces quartered lengthwise
1 small head cabbage, cut into fourths
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Put corned beef in a pot, cover with water, add seasonings, simmer: Put the brisket in a 5 or 6 quart Dutch oven and cover with an inch of water.
If you are using corned beef brisket and it does not come already packed in seasoning, add peppercorns, cloves, and a bay leaf to the pot.
If using plain brisket, add a teaspoon of salt for every quart of water.
Bring to a simmer and then cover, lower the heat until it is barely simmering. Keep at a low simmer for four hours or until the meat is tender (a fork goes through easily).
2 Remove meat, add vegetables, simmer: Remove the meat and set aside, keeping the meat warm. Add the vegetables to the pot. Check the broth for taste. If it is too salty, add a little more water to taste.
Raise the temperature and bring the soup to a high simmer. Cook at a high simmer until done, about 15-30 minutes longer, depending on the size of the cut of your vegetables.

3 Slice meat across the grain: Slice the meat in thin slices across the grain. You may find it easier to slice if you first cut the roast in half along the same direction as the grain of the meat. Then slice smaller lengths across the grain.

Serve in bowls, a few pieces of meat in each, add some of the vegetables and some broth. Serve with horseradish or mustard or both.

If you finely chop (1/2-inch) the butternut squash, apple, carrot, celery, and onion, they'll cook more quickly.
Add a smoky flavor to the soup by sprinkling in some smoked paprika. Make the soup a little more creamy by swirling in some sour cream (after you remove the soup from heat).
Butternut squashes come in various sizes. Your ratio of chopped butternut squash to chopped apple should be 3 to 1.
INGREDIENTS
For the soup:
1 medium yellow onion, chopped (about 1 cup)
1 celery rib, chopped (about 3/4 cup)
1 carrot, chopped (about 3/4 cup)
2 tablespoons unsalted butter
1 butternut squash, peeled and chopped (6 to 8 cups), seeds discarded (see How to Peel and Cut a Butternut Squash)
1 large tart green apple, peeled, cored, chopped (squash to apple ratio should be 3:1)
3 cups chicken stock or broth (or vegetable broth)
1 cup water
Pinches of nutmeg, cinnamon, cayenne, salt and pepper
For the garnish (optional):
Fresh parsley, chopped
Chives, chopped
Dash of smoked paprika
Sour cream
METHOD
1 Sauté onion, carrot, celery in butter: Heat a large thick-bottomed pot on medium-high heat. Melt the butter in the pot and let it foam up and recede. Add the onion, carrot, and celery and sauté for 5 minutes. Lower the heat if the vegetables begin to brown.
2 Cook the soup: Add the butternut squash, apple, broth, and water. Bring to boil. Reduce to a simmer, cover, and simmer for 30 minutes or so, until the squash and carrots have softened.
3 Purée the soup: Use an immersion blender to purée the soup, or work in batches and purée the soup in a stand blender.
4 Add seasonings: Add pinches of nutmeg, cinnamon, and cayenne. Add salt and pepper to taste.
Garnish with chopped fresh parsley or chives and, if you want, a dollop of sour cream.

Ham and Potato Soup Recipe
Prep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 30 minutesYield: Serves 6
You can either make this soup using leftover ham and a ham bone or you can use a meaty ham shank. If you use a ham bone, you'll add the chopped ham at the end of cooking. If you are using a ham shank, after the soup cooks with the ham shank, you'll need to remove it, cut away the meat, chop the meat, and return it to the soup.
INGREDIENTS
2 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil
1 1/2 cups chopped onion
3/4 cup chopped parsnips or carrots
3/4 cup chopped celery
1 minced garlic clove
1 meaty ham bone from a ham, or a meaty ham shank
6 cups low sodium chicken stock
2 bay leaves
2 sprigs thyme
2 pounds Russet potatoes, peeled, and cut into 3/4-inch cubes
1 1/2 cups cubed ham (if using a ham bone), 3/4-inch dice
1/2 teaspoon ground pepper
1/4 cup whipping cream
Salt to taste
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Cook onions, parsnips or carrots, celery, garlic in olive oil: Heat olive oil in a large, thick-bottomed pot or Dutch oven on medium high heat.
Add the onions, parsnips or carrots, celery, and sauté for 7 to 8 minutes. Add the garlic and cook for a minute more.
2 Add ham bone or shank, stock, bay leaves, thyme: Add the ham bone or ham shank to the pot. Add 6 cups of stock. Add bay leaves and thyme. Bring to a boil, lower the heat to maintain a simmer. Cover and simmer for 45 minutes.
3 Add potatoes: Add the potatoes and simmer for 15 more minutes, until they are cooked through.
4 Remove ham bone or shank, purée half the soup: Remove the ham bone or ham shank from the soup. Purée half of the soup so that some of the potatoes get puréed to give the soup body, and there are still whole chunks of potatoes for texture.
5 Add chopped ham: If using a ham shank, cut away the meat and chop into 3/4-inch cubes. Add the chopped ham and black pepper to the soup.
6 Stir in the cream. Taste for salt and pepper and add more if needed.

Herbes de Provence Skillet Chicken with Potatoes and Greens Recipe
Prep time: 15 minutesCook time: 35 minutesMarinade time: 2 hoursYield: 4 to 6
INGREDIENTS
For the marinade:
1 1/2 pounds boneless skinless chicken tenders, tenderloin, or thinly sliced chicken breasts
1 1/2 tablespoons herbes de Provence
1 1/4 teaspoons Kosher salt
1 teaspoon freshly ground pepper
Zest of one lemon
1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice
3 cloves minced garlic
2 tablespoons olive oil
For the vegetables:
2 teaspoons olive oil
3 tablespoons butter, divided
1 1/2 pounds B-sized or baby potatoes
1/2 yellow onion
1/2 teaspoon Kosher salt
A few cracks of freshly ground pepper
2 handfuls (2 packed cups) Swiss chard or spinach
1/3 cup halved pimento-stuffed Spanish olives
1 teaspoon red wine vinegar
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Label the bag: Use a sharpie to write the date and title of the recipe on a gallon-sized zip top bag so you can easily find it on SimplyRecipes.com when you want to cook it. Alternatively, write the cooking instructions on the bag, and date it.
2 Combine the ingredients: Roll down the opening of the bag a little just so you don’t accidently get raw chicken juices on the outside of the zip top. Add the chicken, spices, zest, lemon juice, garlic and olive oil.
Remove as much air as possible and seal the bag. Smoosh the chicken around so it’s coated in the marinade.
3 Lay the chicken flat in the freezer and freeze for up to 6 months:
Alternatively, you could skip the freezer and let it marinade in the fridge for a couple of hours and up to two days, then cook it according to the directions below.
 4 Thaw the chicken before cooking: When ready to cook, take the chicken out of the freezer in the morning before you go to work, and it will be ready to cook by the end of the day.
5 Prepare the vegetables: If the b-sized potatoes are larger than a golf ball, quarter them; if they are smaller just half them. Slice the onion. Wash the Swiss chard, remove the stems and chop them. Then cut the leaves into strips about an inch thick. Cut the olives in half.
  6 Cook the chicken: Set a large skillet over medium heat add 2 teaspoons of olive oil and 1 tablespoon butter. Once the oil shimmers and the butter melts, add the chicken and any marinade in the bag.
If any chicken is folded up, unfold it so it lays flat in the pan. Cook the chicken for 2 minutes, then flip it.
7 Add the vegetables: Add the potatoes, onion, and 1/4 cup water to the pan with the chicken. Cover with a lid. Let everything simmer together for about 10 minutes.
8 Finish the potatoes and make the sauce: Remove the chicken to a plate (leaving the vegetables in the skillet) and tent with foil. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons of butter, 1/4 teaspoon of salt and a few cracks of freshly ground pepper to the skillet. Stir the potatoes, cover and cook for another 10 minutes.
Turn the heat up to medium high to reduce the liquid and finish cooking the potatoes uncovered. This should take about 2 to 3 minutes depending on how much liquid is in the pan.
When you can easily pierce the potatoes with a fork, add the chard leaves and chopped stems, olives, and red wine vinegar. Toss gently until the greens are just wilted.
9 Serve: Nestle the chicken back into the pan. Bring the whole thing over to the table and serve.

Puerto Rican Salmorejo (Stewed Crab and Tomatoes with Rice) Recipe
Prep time: 10 minutesCook time: 20 minutesYield: 6 servings
INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil
6 mini sweet peppers (or yellow, red, or orange bell pepper), diced (about 1/4 cup)
1/2 green bell pepper, diced (about 1/2 cup)
1 medium white onion, diced (about 1 cup)
3 cloves garlic, minced
3 large Roma tomatoes, diced (about 2 cups)
1 (8-ounce) can of tomato sauce, about 1/4 cup
2 tablespoons recaito, store-bought or homemade
1 1/2 teaspoons Sazón con culantro y achiote seasoning, store-bought or homemade
1 teaspoon dried oregano
1 teaspoon kosher salt
1/4 teaspoon black pepper
1 bay leaf
6 stuffed Manzanilla olives
1 tablespoon capers, drained of brine
1 pound crabmeat (lump, backfin, or claw, or a combination of these)
1/2 cup water
To serve:
Cooked white rice
Fried green plantain chips (optional)
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Cook the veggies: In a large skillet with a lid, heat the oil over medium-high heat until the surface of the oil begins to ripple. Add the sweet peppers, bell pepper, onion, and garlic to the pan and sauté for 3 minutes, or until the vegetables look glossy and translucent.
Reduce the heat to medium, and add the tomatoes to the pan. Cook the mixture, stirring frequently, for 4 more minutes.
2 Simmer the spices and seasonings: Stir in the tomato sauce, recao, Sazón, oregano, salt, pepper, bay leaf, olives, and capers. Bring the ingredients to a gentle simmer and then lower the heat to maintain the simmer—tiny bubbles should just barely break the surface of the liquid. Simmer for five minutes, uncovered.
3 Fold in the crabmeat and simmer: Add the crabmeat and water to the pan, and gently fold the meat into the tomato sauce. Avoid stirring too aggressively: you want to keep the crabmeat in lumps.
Reduce the heat to medium-low, and cover the pan. Allow the salmorejo to simmer for 10 minutes without stirring.
4 Serve: Serve the salmorejo over steamed white rice, or atop fried plantain chips. Leftovers will keep in the refrigerator for up to two days and reheat well over the stovetop or in the microwave.
You can also freeze the salmorejo for up to two months in a zip-top storage bag. Thaw overnight in the fridge, and warm it on the stove in a saucepan until it’s bubbling.

Beef Steak Fajitas Recipe
Prep time: 1 hour, 10 minutesCook time: 15 minutesYield: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon vegetable oil
1 pound of flank steak, skirt steak or carne asada
1 large yellow onion, peeled and sliced with the grain, not against the grain as one would normally slice an onion. Slice first in half, and then slice off sections a half inch wide at widest point.
2-3 bell peppers of various colors, stemmed, seeded, de-ribbed, sliced lengthwise into strips
Salt
STEAK FAJITA MARINADE:
Juice of 1 lime
2 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, peeled, minced
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 fresh jalapeño pepper, seeded, ribs removed, finely chopped (be careful not to touch your eyes or anywhere near your eyes after handling a jalapeño pepper!)
1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro, including stems
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Marinate the steak: Mix all marinade ingredients. Coat the steak with the marinade and let it sit at room temperature for an hour, or longer in the fridge.
Before you cook the meat, wipe off most of the marinade and sprinkle the steak with salt.
2 Sear the steak on both sides: Set a large cast iron pan or griddle over high heat and let this heat up for 1-2 minutes. Add the tablespoon of oil to the pan and let this heat up for 1 minute.
Add the steak, frying on each side for 3 minutes, or to desired doneness. 3 minutes per side will yield approximately medium rare doneness for an average cut of flank steak.
Carne asada and skirt steak will need less time. If the pan starts to smoke too much, reduce the heat to medium-high. You want the steak browned, not burned.
Remove from pan and let sit, tented with foil, for 5 minutes.
3 Cook the vegetables while the meat is resting. Add a little more oil to the pan if necessary, then add the onions and bell peppers.
Let these sear for 1 minute before stirring, then stir every 90 seconds or so as the veggies sear. Cook for 5-6 minutes total.
4 Slice the meat across the grain into thin slices. If you slice the meat at an angle, you will be able to get your slices pretty thin. These cuts of steak are flavorful but can be a little tough, so thin slices will really help make it easier to eat.
5 Serve immediately with shredded cheese, salsa, shredded iceberg lettuce, sour cream, guacamole and warm flour tortillas. (Hint for warming tortillas - put in microwave over a paper towel for 20 seconds on high heat.)

9 Finish the sauce: Turn the heat up to medium high. Add 1 tablespoon butter to the sauce. Stir it in and let the sauce reduce uncovered for about 2 minutes. Add the spinach stir to coat a couple of times until the spinach has wilted.
10 To serve: Nestle the chicken back into the pan, and season to taste with salt and pepper.
Bring the skillet to the table. Spoon up chicken, vegetables and sauces into shallow bowls or plates. Serve with crusty bread to sop up the sauce.

Best Ever Sloppy Joes Recipe
Prep time: 10 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: Serves 4
Save time on prep by pulsing roughly chopped veggies in a food processor.
Brown the meat well. Don't crowd the pan, work in batches, and don't stir the meat until it is well browned on one side.
INGREDIENTS
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
1/2 cup minced carrots (can sub chopped bell pepper)
1 cup finely chopped onion (about 1 medium onion)
1/2 cup finely chopped celery
2 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 teaspoon salt
1 1/4 pound ground beef
1/2 cup ketchup
2 cups tomato sauce (or 1 15-ounce can whole tomatoes, puréed)
1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce
1 tablespoon red wine vinegar
1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar
Pinch ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon dried thyme
Pinch cayenne pepper
2 turns of freshly ground black pepper
4 hamburger buns
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Sauté the carrots, onions, celery, and garlic: Heat olive oil in a large sauté pan on medium high heat. Add the minced carrots and sauté for 5 minutes. (If you are using bell pepper instead of carrots, add those at the same time as the onions.)
Add the chopped onion and celery. Cook, stirring occasionally until onions are translucent, about 5 more minutes.
Add the minced garlic and cook for 30 more seconds. Remove from heat. Remove vegetables from the pan to a medium sized bowl, set aside.
2 Brown the ground beef: Using the same pan (or you can cook the meat at the same time as the vegetables in a separate pan to save time), crumble the ground beef into the pan. If you are using extra lean beef, you may need to add a tablespoon of olive oil to the pan. Sprinkle the meat with salt.
Do not stir the ground beef, just let it cook until it is well browned on one side. Then flip the pieces over and brown the second side.
If you're cooking in batches, use a slotted spoon to remove the ground beef from the pan (can add to the set-aside vegetables) and repeat with the rest of the ground beef.
When the meat is done cooking, strain off all but 1 tablespoon of any fat left in the pan.
3 Make the sloppy joe mix: Return the cooked ground beef and vegetables to the pan. Use a wooden spoon to break up any chunks of ground beef into smaller bits.
Add the ketchup, tomato sauce, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, and brown sugar to the pan. Stir to mix well. Add ground cloves, thyme, and cayenne pepper.
Lower the heat to medium low and let simmer for 10 minutes. Adjust seasonings to taste.
4 Serve the sloppy joes: Serve immediately, or refrigerate to make ahead and reheat to serve. Serve with toasted hamburger buns.

Baked Acorn Squash with Butter and Brown Sugar Recipe
Prep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 15 minutesYield: Serves 2 to 4, depending on how much squash you like to eat.
INGREDIENTS
1 Acorn squash
1 Tbsp Butter
2 Tbsp Brown Sugar
2 teaspoons Maple Syrup
Dash of Salt
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Preheat your oven to 400°F (205°C).
2 Prep the squash: If you have a microwave, microwave the squash for a minute each, to make it easier to cut. Stabilize the squash on a cutting board as best you can, stem end down if the stem is short enough, otherwise on the side. Using a sharp, sturdy chef's knife, carefully cut the acorn squash in half, from tip to stem. If on its side, the squash can rock back and forth, so take care as you are cutting it.
Use a sturdy metal spoon to scrape out the seeds and stringy bits inside each squash half, until the inside is smooth.
Take a sharp paring knife and score the insides of the acorn squash halves in a cross-hatch pattern, about a half-inch deep cuts.
Place the squash halves cut side up in a roasting pan. Pour 1/4-inch of water over the bottom of the pan so that the squash doesn't burn or get dried out in the oven.
3 Add butter, salt, brown sugar, maple syrup: Rub a half tablespoon of butter into the insides of each half. Sprinkle with a little salt if you are using unsalted butter.
Crumble a tablespoon of brown sugar into the center of each half and drizzle with a teaspoon of maple syrup.
4 Bake: Bake at 400°F (205°C) for about an hour to an hour 15 minutes, until the tops of the squash halves are nicely browned, and the squash flesh is very soft and cooked through.
It's hard to overcook squash, it just gets better with more caramelization. But don't undercook it.
5 Remove from oven, spoon brown sugar butter sauce over squash: When done, remove the squash halves from the oven and let them cool for a bit before serving.
Spoon any buttery sugar sauce that has not already been absorbed by the squash over the exposed areas.

Vegan Stuffed Squash with Brown Rice and Mushrooms Recipe
Prep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hourYield: Serves 6
The vegetables and rice for the filling and the roasted squash halves can be prepped a day or two ahead. Warm them on the stovetop or in the microwave before continuing with the recipe.
Note that one of the squashes is pureed and mixed into the filling. The remaining squash halves will be stuffed and served.
INGREDIENTS
For the squash:
4 small winter squash (about 1 1/2 pounds each), like kabocha, acorn squash, or pie pumpkins
1/2 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
1/4 teaspoon pepper
For the filling:
4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
2 cups brown rice
4 cups low-sodium vegetable broth or water
1 cup diced carrot
1 cup diced shallots
1 cup diced celery
1 1/4 pounds mushrooms, diced (I used a mix of creminis and wild mushrooms),
3 cloves garlic, minced
1/2 cup white wine
Pinch cinnamon
1 cup chopped mixed herbs (parsley, chives, and chervil work beautifully here)
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Heat the oven to 400F and prepare the squash. Cut the squash in half and scrape out the seeds. Cut a small sliver from the bottom of each squash half to create a stable surface for the "bowl." Rub the squash halves inside and out with olive oil, then sprinkle generously with salt and pepper.
2 Roast the squash: Roast the squash halves cut-side down for 30 minutes, then flip them over and roast cut-side up (like a bowl) for another 15 minutes. When done, the squash should be easily pierced with a fork and toasted golden-brown on the surface. (About 45 minutes total; if the squash finishes roasting before the filling is ready, turn the oven heat to its lowest temperature and keep them warm until needed.)
3 While the squash roasts, begin preparing the rice stuffing: In a large pot over medium heat, toast the rice with 1 tablespoon of olive oil until the rice smells fragrant and nutty, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir frequently to avoid burning.
4 Cook the rice: Pour the vegetable broth or water over the rice and give it a quick stir. Bring to a boil over high heat. Once the water reaches boiling, turn down heat to low, cover the pot, and cook for 25 to 30 minutes until the rice is tender. If the rice isn’t done, continue checking every five minutes.
5 Cook the carrots, shallots, and celery: Warm 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a 12-inch skillet over medium heat. Sauté the carrot, shallot, and celery until the shallots become translucent, about 5 minutes. Transfer the veggies to a large bowl, and set aside.
6 Cook the mushrooms in batches: In the same 12-inch skillet, add 1 tablespoon of olive oil and turn the heat to medium-high. Add a third of the mushrooms – do not to overcrowd the pan. Sprinkle 1/8 teaspoon salt and a little pepper over the mushrooms, but do not stir.
Let the mushrooms cook without stirring for 2 to 3 minutes, until a caramelized crust forms on the bottom of the mushrooms. (Lift one up to check!) Once you see a brown crust, stir the mushrooms together. Continue cooking, stirring often, until the mushrooms have released all their liquid and look evenly browned on all sides.
Repeat with the remaining mushrooms, adding more oil to the pan as needed.
7 Finish the vegetables: When all the mushrooms are cooked, return the cooked mushrooms, carrots, shallots, and celery to the pan over medium-high heat. Stir in the garlic and cook until fragrant, 30 seconds. Add the white wine and scrape any glazed bits from the bottom of the pan as the wine simmers. Cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, until most of the wine has evaporated. Remove from heat.
(If the vegetables and rice are ready before the roasted squash, cover the pans to keep warm until needed. If necessary, re-warm briefly on the stovetop or the microwave before continuing with the recipe.)
8 Set 6 of the roasted squash halves on plates for serving; scoop the flesh from the remaining 2 squash halves. Transfer the flesh to a food processor. Add the cinnamon and puree until very smooth.
9 Finish the squash filling: In a large bowl, combine the mushrooms, vegetables, cooked rice, and squash puree and mix until well-combined. Taste and add more salt, pepper, or cinnamon if you like. Finally, stir in fresh herbs, reserving some herbs for sprinkling over top.
10 Stuff the squashes and serve: Divide the filling equally between all the squash halves, mounding the filling slightly. Sprinkle with chopped herbs and serve immediately while piping hot.

Roasted Winter Squash with Cilantro Chimichurri Recipe
Prep time: 10 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 6 to 8 servings
I typically use acorn or delicata squash for this recipe since they don’t have to be peeled and are easily prepped, though feel free to use any other hearty winter squash like butternut, pumpkin, or kuri. The chimichurri sauce is also great on roasted potatoes, carrots, and sweet potatoes.
Urfa biber is a dark maroon chili flake common in Turkish cuisine. A super adulty spice. The chilies are sun-cured during the day and sweated at night before being ground with a touch of salt. The result is a smoky-salty-sweet-savory chili flake whose complex flavor is reminiscent of chocolate, raisins, and inky red wine. The heat is mild, but builds the more you eat, yet never overwhelms. It’s one of those rare ingredients that really can go on nearly everything. I actually keep it in a small container on the kitchen table for this reason and recommend you do so as well.
You can find urfa biber pretty easily online at stores like Spice Jungle or Olive Nation. However, if you don’t have urfa biber chili flakes, then feel free to use regular chili flakes. I have done this plenty of times and the recipe is equally awesome.
INGREDIENTS
For the squash:
3 pounds acorn or delicata squash
1 tablespoon olive oil
1/4 teaspoon salt
Ground black pepper
For the cilantro chimichurri:
1/2 cup olive oil
1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro
1/2 cup finely chopped parsley
1 tablespoon finely chopped oregano leaves
1 1/2 teaspoons urfa biber, or regular chili flakes
1/4 teaspoon salt
4 garlic cloves, minced
1/4 cup red wine vinegar
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Preheat the oven to 375F. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, a silicon baking mat, or parchment paper.
2 Prepare the squash: Cut the squash in half lengthwise. Scoop out and discard the strings and seeds (save and roast the seeds, if you like). Cut the squash into 1-inch slices.
Toss the squash with a 1 tablespoon of olive oil, 1/4 teaspoon or so of salt, and ground black pepper. Place on the prepared baking sheet.
3 Roast the squash for 30 minutes or until easily pierced with a fork.
4 While the squash is cooking prepare the chimichurri. In a medium bowl, stir together the olive oil, cilantro, parsley, oregano leaves, chili flakes, garlic, red wine vinegar and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Taste and add more salt if needed.
5 Serve: Transfer the roasted squash to a serving platter or individual plates, top with a generous amount of chimichurri, and enjoy.

Stuffed Squash with Turkey and Apples Recipe
Prep time: 10 minutesCook time: 45 minutesYield: 2 servings
While the squash roasts, you can do almost all of the prep work for this dish.
This recipe is easily doubled to create 4 servings.
INGREDIENTS
1 medium (about 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 pound) acorn squash, halved lengthwise and seeded
2 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon olive oil
1 teaspoon salt, divided
1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper
1/2 cup uncooked wild rice
6 ounces ground turkey or ground breakfast sausage
1 small shallot, finely chopped
1 stalk celery, finely chopped
1/2 large apple (Honeycrisp, Jonagold, or Braeburn), unpeeled, cored, and cut into small dice
1 tablespoon chopped fresh sage leaves
1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary
2 tablespoons dried cranberries
1 tablespoon fine, dry breadcrumbs
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Preheat the oven: Preheat the oven to 425ºF. Line a baking sheet with parchment.
2 Roast the squash: Brush the squash with 1 tablespoon of the oil and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon salt and a pinch of pepper. With the cut sides down, place the squash on the baking sheet. Bake for 35 to 40 minutes, or until tender when pierced with the tip of a paring knife. Remove and cool briefly.
3 While the squash roasts, cook the rice: In a small saucepan, bring 2 cups water and 1/4 teaspoon salt to a boil. Add the rice and adjust the heat to a simmer. Set a lid on top, slightly askew, and cook for 40 to 45 minutes, or until the rice “grains” are tender (some grains may begin to separate or burst). Drain in a sieve or fine-mesh colander.
4 Cook the turkey and vegetables: In a medium skillet over medium-high heat, add 1 tablespoon of the oil. Add the turkey and break it up into tablespoon-sized clumps using a stiff spatula or wooden spoon. Cook for 5 to 7 minutes, stirring often to further break up the meat, until it begins to brown.
Add the shallot, celery, apple, sage, rosemary, cranberries, 1/2 teaspoon salt, and a pinch of pepper. Cook and stir for another 3 to 4 minutes, or until the vegetables soften.
If the pan seems dry, add up to 1/4 cup water, 1 tablespoon at a time, and stir to scrape up any brown bits on the bottom of the skillet until the water evaporates. Stir in the cooked rice. Taste and add more salt and pepper, if you like.
5 Stuff the squash: Turn the squash on the baking sheet so the cut side is up. Divide the filling between the halves.
6 Bake the squash: In a small bowl, mix the breadcrumbs with 1 teaspoon of oil. Sprinkle on top of the squash halves.
Bake for 10 minutes, or until hot all the way through and the breadcrumbs are browned.

Red Chile Marinated Grilled Chicken Recipe
Prep time: 10 minutesCook time: 1 hourMarinating time: 1 hourYield: Serves 4-6
Making the sauce from scratch, our chicken ended up quite spicy hot, almost like jerk chicken. Using canned sauce as a base, even one with medium heat, most of the heat was lost in the cooking process. If you like your chicken spicy hot, and you are using a canned sauce, I recommend starting with one that is graded "hot".
INGREDIENTS
3 pounds bone-in, skin-on chicken parts, preferably thighs, trimmed of excess skin and fat
Salt
1 1/4 cup Mexican red chili sauce, either homemade* or canned (if you are gluten intolerant and are using canned chili sauce, make sure to read the ingredients on the can, some makers put wheat products in their sauce)
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons white or cider vinegar
1/2 teaspoon ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon ground allspice
1 teaspoon cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon ground cumin
A couple of turns on a black pepper grinder
A pinch of dried oregano, crushed
1 teaspoon minced garlic
Garnish
Avocado slices
Thinly sliced lettuce or cabbage
Thinly sliced radishes
Cilantro
* To make your own homemade sauce, take 2 ancho and 2 guajillo chiles, open them up, remove the stems, seeds, and ribs. Lightly toast the chiles on a medium griddle or cast iron pan for a minute or two, flattening them down with a metal spatula. Place the chiles in a saucepan, cover with water, bring to a boil, remove from heat and let soak for 10-15 minutes, until chiles are softened. Place chiles, 1 1/4 cup of the soaking water, 1 clove of garlic, a pinch of salt, in a blender. Blend until completely smooth. Put mixture through a strainer to strain out any solids. Proceed with the recipe, but don't add any more garlic to the sauce.
METHOD
1 Simmer chili sauce and spices to make the marinade: Heat oil in a medium sized saucepan on medium heat. Add the chili sauce. Add vinegar (2 Tbsp if using canned sauce, 4 Tbsp in you've made your own sauce), cloves, allspice, cinnamon, cumin, black pepper, oregano and garlic.
Bring to a simmer and let simmer for 5 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let cool.
2 Marinate chicken: Sprinkle salt over all the chicken pieces on all sides. Put chicken pieces in a non-reactive bowl or a large freezer bag. Add the marinade, make sure all pieces are coated well with the marinade.
Marinate in the refrigerator at least one hour, preferably overnight.
3 Grilling Instructions: Remove the chicken from the refrigerator before starting up the grill. Preheat your grill, allowing for a space on the grill for cooking the chicken with indirect heat. (If using coals, move all the coals to one side of the grill, if using gas, after the grill is hot, turn off one of the burners.)
Brush the grill grates with olive oil. Make sure the chicken pieces are well coated on all sides with the paste-like marinade.
Place the chicken pieces on the indirect heat part of the grill (not over a flame or coals). Cook, covered, for 25-30 minutes, turning the pieces over after the first 15 minutes. Try to keep the temperature in the grill around 350°F. Chicken is done when juices run clear, breasts have an internal temperature of 165°F and thighs 175°F.
3a Roasting Instructions: If you aren't in a grilling mood, you can roast the chicken pieces in the oven. Preheat the oven to 350°F. Place the chicken pieces in a roasting pan, skin-side up. Cook for about 45-50 minutes, until breasts have an internal temperature of 165°F and thighs 175°F.
4 Serve with garnishes: Serve garnished with sliced avocado, sliced lettuce or cabbage dressed with a little vinegar and oil, sliced radishes and cilantro.
Makes for great leftover chicken to cut up and put into tacos.

Mexican Red Chili Sauce Recipe
Prep time: 5 minutesCook time: 25 minutesYield: Makes a little more than 1 cup
INGREDIENTS
3 dried Ancho (sometimes called pasilla in the US*) chiles OR 2 Ancho and 2 Guajillo chiles
Water
1 large clove garlic
2 black peppercorns, crushed
A pinch of ground cloves
1/2 teaspoon of salt, more to taste
Extra virgin olive oil
* According to Diana Kennedy, Pasilla chilies are a long and skinny variety of chile, while Ancho chilies (dried poblanos) are shorter and wider. However, in certain parts of Michoacan, Mexico, the Ancho chile is called Pasilla, and because of immigration, is commonly known as Pasilla in many parts of the US.
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Cut the chiles open and remove stem and seeds: Working on one chile at a time, use a paring knife to cut a slit all the way down one side of a chile. Open up the chile and remove the stem and seeds. Remove as much of the veins as you can.
Reserve a few of the seeds or veins for adding later if you want added heat.
Note when working with chilies, either wear protective gloves or wash your hands very thoroughly with soap and warm water after handling the chilies. Do not touch or rub your eyes if you have been handling chili peppers.
2 Heat the chiles on a skillet: Heat a large skillet on medium heat. Flatten out the dried chilies as well as you can and place on the skillet to heat.
Press down on the opened chilies and leave for a few seconds. Turn the chilies over and heat a few seconds more.
You do not want to toast or burn the chilies! If they burn, they'll turn bitter. Just heat them enough to draw out more of their flavor.
3 Soften the chiles in hot water: Add the chilies to a small saucepan and add enough water so that they are just covered. Bring to a boil. Remove from heat and let sit for 10 minutes, until the chilies have softened and plumped up.
(OR pour place the chilies in a small saucepan and pour boiling water over them to cover. Let sit for 15 minutes, until softened.)
4 Purée with garlic, seasonings, water or poaching liquid: Reserving the soaking water, remove the chilies from the pan and place in a blender. Add the garlic, salt, crushed peppercorns, ground cloves, and 1 1/2 cups of the soaking liquid (taste the soaking water first, if it seems bitter, use plain water instead).
Purée for 2 minutes, until the sauce is completely smooth. Taste the sauce and adjust the seasoning. If you want more heat, add in a few of the seeds or veins and purée some more. Add more salt if needed.
5 Strain through sieve into a skillet, simmer: Pour the sauce through a sieve into a skillet. Add a tablespoon of olive oil to the sauce.
Bring to a simmer and reduce heat to maintain the simmer, cook for 10 minutes. Skim off the foam.
Remove from heat. Use immediately or pour into a glass jar (plastic will get stained) and refrigerate.

African Chicken Peanut Stew Recipe
Prep time: 20 minutesCook time: 1 hour, 55 minutesYield: Serves 6-8
Use chicken legs, thighs or wings for this recipe. They have more flavor and will hold up better with the flavors of the stew than breast meat.
INGREDIENTS
2-3 pounds chicken legs, thighs and/or wings
3 Tbsp vegetable oil
1 large yellow or white onion, sliced
A 3-inch piece of ginger, peeled and minced
6-8 garlic cloves, chopped roughly
2-3 pounds sweet potatoes, peeled and cut into chunks
1 15-ounce can of crushed tomatoes
1 quart chicken stock
1 cup peanut butter
1 cup roasted peanuts
1 Tbsp ground coriander
1 teaspoon cayenne, or to taste
Salt and black pepper
1/4 to 1/2 cup of chopped cilantro
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Brown the chicken. Heat the vegetable oil in a large soup pot set over medium-high heat. Salt the chicken pieces well, pat them dry and brown them in the oil. Don't crowd the pot, so do this in batches. Set the chicken pieces aside as they brown.
2 Sauté the vegetables. Sauté the onions in the oil for 3-4 minutes, stirring often and scraping any browned bits off the bottom of the pot. Add the ginger and garlic and sauté another 1-2 minutes, then add the sweet potatoes and stir well to combine.
3 Cook the stew. Add the chicken broth, crushed tomatoes, peanut butter, peanuts, coriander and cayenne and stir well to combine. Add the chicken. Bring to a simmer and taste for salt, adding more if needed.
Cover the pot and simmer gently for 90 minutes (check after an hour), or until the chicken meat easily falls off the bone and the sweet potatoes are tender.
4 Remove bones and chop the cooked chicken. Remove the chicken pieces and set them in a bowl to cool, until cool enough to touch. Remove and discard the skin if you want, or chop it and put it back into the pot.
Shred the meat off the bones and put the meat back in the pot.
5 Adjust seasonings. Adjust the seasonings for salt and cayenne, then add as much black pepper as you think you can stand—the stew should be peppery. Stir in the cilantro and serve by itself, or with simple steamed rice.

Chicken Drumsticks, Ethiopian Style Recipe
Prep time: 10 minutesCook time: 2 hoursYield: Serves 6-8
You can do this with chicken wings or thighs, too, but don't use breasts — they will dry out.
INGREDIENTS
3-4 pounds chicken legs, thighs or wings
2 Tbsp peanut oil, or melted butter (or ghee)
Salt
Lemons or limes for serving
Spice Mix:
2 Tbsp sweet paprika
1 Tbsp hot paprika, or 1-2 teaspoons cayenne
2 teaspoons garlic powder
1 teaspoon ground ginger
1 teaspoon ground cumin
1 teaspoon onion powder
1 teaspoon black pepper
1 teaspoon ground fenugreek
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom
1/4 teaspoon ground cloves
METHOD
1 Preheat oven to 325°.
2 Coat the drumsticks in the peanut oil or melted butter, then sprinkle with salt.
3 Spice the chicken: Mix all the spices together in a small bowl. In a large bowl, mix half of the spice mix with the chicken.
4 Place chicken in foil: Then arrange the drumsticks in a casserole dish lined with enough foil to make a package; you will be cooking these legs covered for most of the time.
Sprinkle more of the spice mix over the drumsticks. You can use all of the spice mix, or stop whenever you want. The more mix, the spicier the chicken.
Fold over the foil to seal up the drumsticks.
5 Bake: Bake at 325°F for 90 minutes. At 90 minutes, open up the foil packet to let the chicken continue to cook uncovered. Continue cooking for at least another 15 minutes, and as long as you like.
I like the meat to almost fall off the bone on my drumsticks, so I cook uncovered for another 30-45 minutes.
6 Serve: To serve, baste with a little of the sauce that forms at the bottom of the pan, and use the rest to flavor some rice or flatbread.
Squeeze some lemon or lime juice over the chicken right before you serve it.
A green salad is a good side dish, too.

Grilled Moroccan Chicken Recipe
Prep time: 5 minutesCook time: 15 minutesMarinating time: 2 hoursYield: Serves 4
INGREDIENTS
1/2 cup plain yogurt
1 Tbsp lemon juice
1/2 cup chopped fresh cilantro
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
2 cloves garlic, minced
1 1/2 teaspoons ground cumin
1 teaspoon paprika
1/2 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
1 1/2 pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts
METHOD
1 Marinate the chicken: Mix the marinade ingredients (yogurt, lemon juice, cilantro, olive oil, garlic, cumin, paprika, cinnamon, salt, and pepper) together in a medium sized bowl.
Add the chicken pieces to the bowl and thoroughly coat with the marinade.
Cover with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator from 2 hours to overnight.
2 Grill the chicken: Heat your grill on high heat if you are using a gas grill, or prepare coals for direct heat if you are using charcoal. Allow for one side of the grill to be the "cool" side. If you do not have a grill you can use a cast-iron grill pan on your stove.
Grill the chicken breasts over direct high heat a couple of minutes on one side. Then turn them over and move them to the cool side of the grill. Cover and cook for a few minutes more, until the chicken is cooked through.
(The easiest way to test for doneness is with your fingertips. See The Finger Test to Check the Doneness of Meat. Or use a meat thermometer, remove the meat from the grill when the internal temperature of the chicken breast reaches 165°F.)
Take care not to overcook, as chicken breasts can easily dry out.

Skillet Chermoula Chicken Recipe
Prep time: 10 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: Serves 4 to 6
INGREDIENTS
6 bone-in, skin-on chicken thighs (about 2 pounds), trimmed of excess fat
1 teaspoon salt
1 tablespoon extra virgin olive oil
Chermoula Sauce
1 1/2 teaspoons whole cumin seed (or 1 teaspoon ground)
1/2 teaspoon whole coriander seed (or 1/4 teaspoon ground)
4 cloves garlic
1 1/2 cups medium packed parsley leaves
1 1/2 cups medium packed cilantro leaves and tender stems
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1 teaspoon lemon zest
1/2 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 tablespoons lemon juice
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Salt chicken thighs on both sides and let rest while you prepare the sauce.
2 If using whole cumin and coriander seeds, lightly toast the whole cumin and coriander in a small skillet on medium heat, until fragrant. Put into a mortar and pestle and grind until powdery.
3 Make the chermoula sauce: Put 4 cloves garlic, parsley, cilantro, salt, cumin, coriander, paprika, and lemon zest in a food processor. Pulse several times. With the motor running, slowly add in 1/2 cup of olive oil, then the lemon juice. Process until you have a smooth paste. You should have almost a cup of chermoula sauce.
4 Brown chicken thighs in skillet: Heat 1 Tbsp olive oil on medium high heat in a large cast iron pan and preheat oven to 350°F.
Pat dry the chicken pieces and place them skin side down in the hot pan. Let them cook until deep golden brown, about 5 to 6 minutes.
Then turn them over and cook a few minutes more.
5 Drain excess fat: Because you are working with skin-on thighs, you will likely render quite a bit of fat. Remove the chicken from the pan and pour off any excess fat. (Do not pour down the drain unless you want to clog your drain pipes.) Return the chicken to the pan.
5 Spread chermoula on chicken, bake in oven: Spread most of the chermoula sauce on both sides of the chicken thighs, reserving 1/4 cup of the fresh sauce to add later.
With the chicken skin-side up, put the skillet in the 350°F oven for 10 to 15 minutes, until the thighs are cooked through and the temperature near the bone is 165°F when tested with a meat thermometer.
6 Spoon remaining sauce over chicken: Stir the reserved fresh chermoula sauce in with the pan sauce. Spoon sauce over the chicken to serve.
Serve with couscous or with basmati rice for a gluten-free option.

Vegetable Shakshuka with Pesto Recipe
Prep time: 20 minutesCook time: 30 minutesYield: 4 servings
INGREDIENTS
4 plum tomatoes, cored and cut into 8 pieces
1 medium beefsteak tomato, cored and cut into 8 pieces
2 tablespoons olive oil
1 bunch scallions, trimmed and thinly sliced
1 medium clove garlic, chopped
1/8 teaspoon black pepper
1/8 teaspoon crushed red pepper
1/2 teaspoon ground cumin
1/2 teaspoon paprika
1/4 cup water, or more if needed
1 yellow pattypan squash, 1 medium summer squash, or 1/2 golden zucchini
4 large eggs
3/4 cup pesto, homemade or store-bought
Handful of fresh basil leaves, for garnish (optional)
Baguette or thick slices of bread, to serve
Equipment:
A blender or food processor
METHODHIDE PHOTOS
1 Blend the tomatoes: Blend the plum and beefsteak tomatoes in a blender or food processor until they are saucy (you should have about 3 cups).
2 Cook the tomato sauce: Heat the olive oil in a large sauté pan over medium heat. Add the scallions and cook, stirring often, for 5 minutes. Add garlic, salt, black pepper, red pepper, cumin, and paprika. Cook, stirring, for 1 minute more.
Add the tomatoes and cook, stirring, for 2 minutes or until they stop sizzling. Add 1/4 cup of water. Lower the heat and simmer the sauce for 5 minutes. If the mixture seems dry, add more water, 1 tablespoon at a time.
3 Prepare the squash or pattypan: Trim top and bottom from the squash and cut into quarters. If using a yellow squash or zucchini, remove the column of seeds from the center (the pattypan has fewer seeds, so it’s OK to leave them in). Very thinly slice the vegetables.
4 Add the squash to the tomato sauce. Stir well and continue cooking for 5 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Add more water, if needed.
5 Cook the eggs: BUse the back of a spoon to make 4 indentations in the tomato mixture. Break one of the eggs into a measuring cup and then carefully pour it into an indentation, being careful not to break the yolk. Repeat with the remaining eggs. Cover the pan and cook over medium heat for 8 minutes or until the whites are set (the yolks will still be runny).
6 Serve: Garnish the dish with dabs of pesto and fresh basil leaves. Serve straight from the pan to individual dishes.
